PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Company

Boston Scientific Corporation is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to transform lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world. As a medical technology leader for nearly 40 years, we advance science for life by providing a broad range of high performance solutions to address unmet patient needs and reduce the cost of healthcare. When used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our" and "the Company" mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries.

Our history began in the late 1960s when our co-founder, John Abele, acquired an equity interest in Medi-tech, Inc., a research and development company focused on developing alternatives to surgery. In 1969, Medi-tech introduced a family of steerable catheters used in some of the world's first less-invasive procedures. In 1979, John Abele joined with Pete Nicholas to form Boston Scientific Corporation, which indirectly acquired Medi-tech. This acquisition began a period of active and focused new product development, innovation, market development and organizational growth. Since then, we have advanced the practice of less-invasive medicine by helping physicians and other medical professionals diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases and medical conditions and improve patients’ quality of life by providing alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that are typically traumatic to the body.

Our net sales have increased substantially since our formation. Our growth has been fueled in part by strategic acquisitions designed to improve our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in the medical device industry and to build depth of portfolio within our core businesses. These strategic acquisitions have helped us to add promising new technologies to our pipeline and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios in the world for use in less-invasive procedures in our core areas of Medical Surgical (MedSurg), Rhythm and Neuro, and Cardiovascular. We believe that the depth and breadth of our product portfolio has also enabled us to compete more effectively in the current healthcare environment that seeks to improve outcomes and lower costs. Our strategy of category leadership also enables us to compete in a changing, contracting landscape and position our products with physicians, managed care, large buying groups, governments and hospitals, while also expanding internationally and managing the complexities of the global healthcare market.

Business Strategy

We operate pursuant to five strategic imperatives: Strengthen Category Leadership, Expand into High Growth Adjacencies, Drive Global Expansion, Fund the Journey to Fuel Growth and Develop Key Capabilities. We believe that our execution of these strategic imperatives will drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase stockholder value while strengthening our leadership position in the medical device industry.

We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and pursue opportunities to diversify and further expand our presence in strategic growth adjacencies and new global markets. Our approach to innovation combines internally-developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions, alliances and other investments. Our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. In the past several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions in support of our growth strategy, both strengthening our core franchises and expanding into high growth adjacent markets.

Our Enterprise Risk Management program analyzes the key risks inherent to achieving our strategic and organizational imperatives. Such risk assessment helps us to anticipate and adapt to potential challenges to preserve and grow shareholder value. Our Board of Directors oversees our risk management program and focuses on the most significant risks facing the Company, including strategic, operational, financial, legal and compliance risks.

We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the necessary training and tools. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities.

We remain committed to maintaining prudent investments in supply chain resiliency on an ongoing basis. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an ongoing program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs.

Quality Assurance

We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for medical devices, which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.

Environmental Regulation and Management

We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are listed on the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This listing recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies.

We have obtained ISO 14001:2015 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 14001:2015 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint.


Competition

We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products.

We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers while also continuing to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively in a less-invasive manner. We also compete on ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to:

•

offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes,

•

create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies,

•

apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,

•

develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions,

•

attract and retain skilled personnel,

•

obtain patent or other protection for our products,

•

obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals,

•

continually enhance our quality systems,

•

manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties and

•

supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.

Medical Device Regulatory Approvals

The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device.

In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.

The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.

The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). An HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD


provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.

In the European Economic Area (EEA), we are required to comply with applicable Medical Device Directives, specifically the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive. These directives require us to affix a CE Mark on medical devices prior to placing them on the market within the EEA. The CE Mark is affixed following conformity assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on product risk. CE Marking indicates conformity to the applicable Essential Requirements of the relevant Medical Devices Directive. The European Union (EU) Commission published a new Medical Device Regulation in 2017, providing a three-year transition period until May 2020, at which time, the existing Directives will be repealed. The Medical Device Regulation will change multiple aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as higher clinical evidence requirements and introduce several new requirements, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI) and many other post-market obligations. Thus, the new Medical Device Regulation significantly modifies and intensifies the compliance requirements for the industry.

We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), the Japanese Pharmaceutical & Medical Device Agency (PMDA) and the China Food and Drug Administration (NMPA). Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, or minimal regulations, are now introducing them. For example, India is in the process of expanding its current regulations to include all medical device categories while many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia are introducing new regulations.

The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.

International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.

Government Affairs

We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on a myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state Governors, legislatures and regulatory agencies, embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers to improve patient care and to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general.

Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement

Political, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do


business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders are significant and new therapies now take longer periods of time to gain widespread adoption.

The impact to our business of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms and delivery system has been immaterial. The ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. In January 2018, another temporary two-year suspension of the 2.3 percent excise tax was passed, extending the suspension to December 31, 2019. We have reinvested substantial amounts of funds that we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.

The U.S. Federal government, as part of the ACA, and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or "sunshine," in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and transfers of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Additional legislation at the state and federal levels may result in further changes to these laws.

As noted below, we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing and utilization in the U.S. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (TCJA), enacted December 22, 2017 in the U.S., makes changes to the tax treatment of health care expenses and repealed the “individual mandate” to purchase private insurance. These tax law changes have resulted in changes to insurance coverage and financing of insurance coverage in individual markets. Additional legislation may result in changes to government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current U.S. Administration has enacted a number of administrative policy changes that will likely result in additional changes to insurance coverage, financing of insurance coverage and benefits offered through private insurance in both the employer-sponsored and individual markets. These changes and other similar changes being considered are likely to lead to an increase in the number of people without insurance. Other individual coverage policies will be less generous than those required under the ACA. The impact of these changes on coverage levels and patient cost-sharing could affect utilization of non-urgent, non-acute services in which our devices are used.

Additionally, while the implementation of the medical device tax has further been suspended until December 31, 2019, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2019 is not clear. The medical device tax may continue to be suspended, or it may be reinstated at the same or at a different level effective January 1, 2020.

We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform, such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations (ACOs), continue to take shape globally. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.

Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients. Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures.


Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of

December 31, 2018

, we held more than

19,000 patents and had approximately 5,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.

We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties.

We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See

Note J – Commitments and Contingencies

to our


consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had approximately 32,000 employees, including approximately 15,000 in operations, 10,000 in selling, marketing and distribution, 5,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development and 4,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed approximately 17,000 outside the U.S., approximately 10,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function.

Community Outreach

We are united by a goal to make a difference in the lives of the 30 million patients we serve. We envision what is possible for communities around the world by giving our time and resources to positively impact the lives of others. Guided by our core values, we seek to improve access to healthcare, to invest in educational programming for students with limited means and access to opportunities, and to support and embrace the spirit of volunteerism within our global workforce, while adhering to strong ethical standards. We also recognize the need to minimize the impact of the manufacturing of our products on the environment and have committed to carbon neutrality in our manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030.

In some parts of the world, access to health information, screening, care and services can be limited. We have partnered with Project HOPE (Health Opportunities for People Everywhere) and Partners in Health to increase the number of healthcare workers in South Africa, India and Mexico. By increasing the number and proficiency of community healthcare workers, we can impact health outcomes for people today and into the future. In 2018, we added to our list of Global Health Grantees by supporting the Children’s HeartLink (CHL) team based in Malaysia. During the year, CHL began formal collaboration with the Malaysian Pediatric Cardiac Society (MPCS) to increase access to high quality pediatric cardiac care for all children in Malaysia. All of our Global Health grants aim to increase the number of healthcare workers, increase screening and awareness about non-communicable diseases, provide an opportunity for our local in-country teams to get involved with our grantees and align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number Three -

GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages is essential to sustainable development.

We are also inspired by young learners who share our passion for innovation and problem solving. Our employees work with students around the world and share their passion for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) through participation in more than 200 STEM events and school programs. Beyond the classroom, our employees provided more than 43,000 hours of community service to make a positive impact at more than 600 global community events in 33 countries. Building on our culture of caring, in 2017, we created an Employee Disaster Relief Fund to support families impacted by large natural weather events and disasters. In 2018, many families impacted by Hurricane Maria continued to benefit from resources from this fund, with our employees and the Company donating nearly $1 million dollars to the fund. In addition, we hosted six employee fundraising


campaigns to support other natural disasters that impacted people around the world. More than 200 employees contributed to these campaigns, which was combined with a Company match and funds donated to the various charitable organizations in support of disaster relief efforts.

We also support the five U.S. communities where we have significant business presences through the Boston Scientific Foundation. The mission of the foundation is simple: to help expand access to quality health care and educational opportunities for underserved populations. The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded nearly $1 million dollars in grant awards to more than 50 nonprofit organizations across the U.S. in 2018. The process involved more than 65 employee volunteers who evaluated proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval, upon which the Boston Scientific Foundation was able to help fuel grassroots innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve.

Seasonality

Our net sales are influenced by many factors, including product launches, acquisitions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, patient, physician and employee holiday schedules and other macro-economic conditions. While our net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality, customer purchases have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth at the end of

Item 1. Business

of this Annual Report. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including as a result of consolidation among companies in our industry. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment or set of segments. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states also amenable to treatment using our products. New direct or indirect competitors may emerge in the future, potentially including companies introducing new sales or distribution models to our industry.

In addition, the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of products and/or services, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. It is necessary for us to devote continued efforts and financial resources to the development or acquisition of scientifically advanced technologies and products. In addition, we will need to apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a delay in the timing of the launch of next-generation products and the overall performance of, and continued physician confidence in, those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may experience declines in market size, average selling prices for our products, medical procedure volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity, increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates, economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations and other third-party payers. These and other factors may adversely impact market sizes, as well as our share of the markets in which we compete, the average selling prices for our products or medical procedure volumes. There can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels, that we will be able to regain or gain market share or compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels. Decreases in market sizes or our market share and declines in average selling prices or procedural volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Continued consolidation in the healthcare industry or additional governmental controls exerted over pricing in key markets

could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power within the markets in which we sell our products. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify, resulting in pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may increase competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and services and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.


Healthcare cost containment pressures, government payment and delivery system reforms, changes in private payer policies, and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and/or the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs, authorities or agencies (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the United States) and private health plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Governments and payers may also institute changes in healthcare delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payers is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement and funding vary by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies and the use of established products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payers. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S., Japan, or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, heightened clinical data requirements, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations

We are subject to a number of market, business, financial, legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

International net sales accounted for

44 percent

of our global net sales in


, which includes sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately

11 percent

. An important part of our strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the U.S. by expanding global presence, including in emerging markets. Our international operations are subject to a number of market, business and financial risks and uncertainties, including those related to geopolitical and economic instability, foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations, competitive product offerings, local changes in health care financing and payment systems and health care delivery systems, local product preferences and requirements, including preferences for local manufacturers; workforce instability, less intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the U.S. and, in certain foreign countries, longer accounts receivable cycles. Such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and, as a result, our sales growth, market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected.

Our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold. Most foreign countries have medical device regulations. Further, most countries outside of the U.S. require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there. In addition, several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations, including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. These factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.

Further, international markets are affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs, which can lead to more rigorous evidence requirements and     lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which our products are used. Governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. In addition, certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries. All of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products and/or reduce the number of procedures in which our products are used, which may adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.

In addition, our international operations are subject to other established and developing U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and/or similar laws in other countries and U.S. and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements, trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws. Global businesses, including those in the medical device industry, are facing increasing scrutiny of, and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to, their international operations. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny, civil and/or criminal proceedings, sanctions and other liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.


In a referendum on June 23, 2016, voters approved for the United Kingdom (UK) to exit the European Union (EU). As it stands, the UK will depart the EU on March 30, 2019 but the terms of its withdrawal and the nature of its future relationship with the EU are still being decided. Future exit of the UK from the EU will have numerous consequences in all areas of the business, including, economic, regulatory, operational, and the actual impact depends on the ultimate deal reached and is very difficult to assess at this time. Changes in the industry regulations could have an effect on existing CE certificates being renewed and new certificates being issued which would impact the ability to trade; however, it is impossible to assess the full impact at this stage.

In December of 2017, EU leaders announced an agreement to begin the next phase of negotiations, with talks on a transition period after March 2019 to begin in early 2018 and discussions on the future UK-EU relationship, including trade and security, to begin in March. At this stage, the materiality to us of the Brexit risk factor remains unknown and unquantifiable.

Any significant changes in the political and economic, financial, competitive, legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct, or plan to expand, our international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

If we are unable to manage our debt levels, maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies, or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations.

As part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value, we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital. Our outstanding debt balance was

$7.056 billion

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$5.616 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

. Although we currently have investment grade ratings at Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Fitch Ratings, our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future and reduce our access to liquidity. Delays in our product development and new product launches could result in disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our credit and security facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demand.

We may record future intangible asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In the second quarter of 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units.  In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and none of our reporting units were at risk of impairment. Refer to

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

contained in

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

of this Annual Report for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.

On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and other intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

As part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio, we have completed multiple acquisitions over the past three years and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring and the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time. Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include, among others, the effectiveness of our due diligence process, our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies, the strength of the acquired technology, results of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures, the continued performance of critical transition services, our ability to adequately fund acquired in-process


research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies, such as increasing sales of our products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. In addition, foreign acquisitions involve unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures and languages, currency risks and risks associated with the economic, political, legal and regulatory environment in specific countries. Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, and if our acquisitions are not successful, we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our results.

We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant source of historical growth for us, and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies.

Our strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. These acquisitions, investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to grow our business. The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions, investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors, including:

•

our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance, if at all,

•

our ability to manage acquisition, investment or alliance opportunities within our capital capacity and prioritize those investments to execute on our strategy,

•

our ability to manage our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with targets,

•

our ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us, if at all,

•

our ability to complete acquisitions, investments or alliances in a timely manner on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all,

•

our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses,

•

our ability to successfully identify and retain key target employees,

•

our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including foreign laws and regulations and

•

our ability to protect intellectual property and to prevail in litigation related to newly acquired technologies.

Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size or nature.

We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives, our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expenses and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences.

We monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that we believe are important to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. For example, in November 2018, we announced a restructuring initiative (the 2019 Restructuring Plan)

intended to support our effort to improve operating performance and meet anticipated market demands by ensuring that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients and customers.

Key activities under the 2019 Restructuring Plan include supply chain network optimization intended to maximize our global manufacturing and distribution network capacity and building functional capabilities that support business growth.

These activities are expected to be initiated in 2019, with the majority of activity expected to be complete by the end of 2021.

The 2019 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately

$200 million

to

$300 million

and reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $100 million to $150 million by the end of 2022 as program benefits are realized.

We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. These measures could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity, which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses some of which impact our operating results. We cannot guarantee that the activities under our restructuring plans or other optimization initiatives will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings.

Current domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

Uncertainty about global economic conditions, including those resulting from credit and sovereign debt issues, has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability. These conditions


may adversely affect our suppliers, leading them to experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they purchase on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries. Continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding.

The strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy. Accordingly, we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions, including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad, may continue to impact negatively our average selling prices, net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payers. In addition, conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets, access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes.

Healthcare policy changes, including healthcare reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Political, economic and policy influences are leading the healthcare industry to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary and evidence necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders may be significant and it may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every product.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. As a U.S. headquartered company with significant domestic sales, the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us. The law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. Under the current administration, there may be a permanent repeal or an alteration of some or all elements of the ACA, but at this time it is not definite that a change will be enacted or what new healthcare provisions may be implemented. While the implementation of the medical device tax has been suspended until December 31, 2019, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2019 is not clear. The tax may continue to be suspended or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level effective January 1, 2020. Other provisions of this law, including comparative effectiveness research, pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems, have started changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded. While the extent to which it has affected our business is not clear, these changes, over the long-term, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products and/or procedures using our products reduce medical procedure volumes and/or increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.

Our products, marketing, sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the EU, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive and beginning in May 2020, the European Medical Device Regulation) and obtain CE


Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:

•

take a significant period of time,

•

require the expenditure of substantial resources,

•

involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance,

•

require changes to products and

•

result in limitations on the indicated uses of products.

In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements.

Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations. Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future.

The European Union regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017, which replaced the existing Directives and provided three years for transition and compliance. The MDR will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as updating clinical data requirements and introducing new ones, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). We and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the Commission and EEA Competent Authorities, creating risks in several areas, including the CE Marking process and data transparency, in the upcoming years.

The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes "off-label" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and other amending Acts pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements.

Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.


Our products are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or other third parties, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, including acquired businesses prior to acquisition by us, or the FDA's or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.

Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which may be very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in commercially viable products.

In order to develop new products and enhance existing products, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses. The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted. Further, we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into, priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies. There can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or that we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us, or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.

Additionally, certain products or groups of products, in particular new products or enhancements of existing products, may have a disproportionate impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to meet growth projections, poor clinical outcomes, increasing regulatory requirements, launch delays and inability to effectively scale manufacturing and achieve targeted margins with respect to any of these products or groups of products in particular may materially adversely impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The medical device industry and its customers continue to face scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations, often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings; imposition of substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or exclusion; diversion of our employees and management's attention; imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.

The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities continue to highly scrutinize our industry. We have received and in the future may receive, subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and other state and federal governmental agencies, including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense, as well as from foreign governments and agencies. The requests and/or subpoenas we have received relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and sale and/or product promotional practices. We have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information and expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot predict when a matter will be resolved, the outcome of the matter or its impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs, including document production costs. An adverse outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation, civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to any existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations. Cooperation with requests and investigations


from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus. If any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time, they could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

In addition, certain foreign governments, state governments (including that of Massachusetts, where we are headquartered) and the U.S. federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. As an example, compliance with the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the U.S. federal level made after August 1, 2013. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business.

We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost and exposure to litigation and have additional adverse effects on our operations.

Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.

We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, and we have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, as well as interpretations as to the legality under European Union state aid rules of tax advantages granted in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

Changes in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax could materially impact our effective tax rate. The U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on December 22, 2017 and we expect the U.S. Treasury to issue future notices and regulations under the TCJA. Certain provisions of the TCJA and the regulations issued thereunder could have a significant impact on our future results of operations as could interpretations made by the Company in the absence of regulatory guidance and judicial interpretations.

Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Commission (EC) and individual taxing jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. The OECD has released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. In addition, the OECD, the EC and individual counties are examining changes to how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business.

Our operations in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica presently benefit from various tax incentives and grants. Unless these incentives and grants are extended, they will expire between 2023 and 2028. If we are unable to renew, extend, or obtain new incentive and grants, the expiration of the existing incentives and grants could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods.

We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions. Furthermore, as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation. Finally, our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain.

Competing parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same


proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.

A number of third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, products and other data and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

We rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We rely on information technology systems, including technology from third party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients or disrupt performance of our products or to access our proprietary information and the technology from third party vendors that we rely upon may have defects or vulnerabilities which, in turn, create vulnerabilities or disruptions in our system. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems, products and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations, or, in the worst case, could result in harm to patients. Such failure, or demonstration of vulnerability to such failure, may also result in additional regulatory scrutiny. We also grow our company through acquisitions and may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems as we work to integrate the acquisitions into our information technology system.


In the U.S., federal and state privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information including patient medical records and other health information. In Europe, the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the EU and, the new General Data Protection Regulation may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations after implementation of the requirements on May 25, 2018. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. We believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that the ongoing costs and impacts of ensuring compliance with such rules are not material to our business. However, there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies. Enforcement actions could be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other healthcare professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.

We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies. We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under

Note J – Commitments and Contingencies

to our

consolidated financial statements

included in

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

of this Annual Report

.

Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation, stockholder derivative suits and contract litigation, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquidity.

The design, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects, off-label use or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.

We are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under

Note J – Commitments and Contingencies

to our

consolidated financial statements

included in

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

of this Annual Report

.

The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Additionally, we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The fact that we do not maintain third-party insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Any failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers


of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA which may result in observations on Form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Standards Organization (ISO) certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the U.S. or the EU and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well.

If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. In most cases, the manufacturing of any specific product is concentrated in one or a few locations. Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals. As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors. Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors' manufacturing processes. A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products, an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizer, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

One of our contract sterilizers, Sterigenics U.S. LLC (Sterigenics), uses ethylene oxide to provide sterilization services for certain men’s health products within our Urology and Pelvic Health business. In October 2018, the DuPage County State's Attorney and Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Sterigenics over the emissions in connection with the use of ethylene oxide during sterilization at Sterigenics’ Willowbrook, Illinois plant. On February 15, 2019, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took action to suspend operations at the Willowbrook facility. Sterigenics is challenging the action by the Illinois EPA. We are committed to ethical and sustainable business practices and have an expectation that our partners comply with all applicable regulations. We believe we currently have adequate inventory levels to sustain the disruption at the Willowbrook facility for the near term and are also pursuing various options to manage any impact to patients or our financial results, including accelerating our plans to move to existing sterilization facilities in our supply chain network. If we are unable to execute any of these options, there may be a material impact to our Urology and Pelvic Health business in the first half of 2019.

Our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate.

Stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility over recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations


due to factors described under this

Item 1A. Risk Factors

, as well as economic and geopolitical conditions in general and to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as, among other things, changing investment priorities of our stockholders. Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices.

If we are unable to attract or retain key personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations.

In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees, particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key personnel, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and developing existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key employees, our ability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any delay in hiring key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Business and Market Overview

The following section describes an overview of our product offerings and results of operations by business unit. For additional information on our businesses and their product offerings, see

Item 1. Business

of this Annual Report.

Effective January 1, 2018, following organizational changes to align the structure of our business with our focus on active implantable devices, we revised our reportable segments, in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

.

The revision reflects a reclassification of our Neuromodulation business from our

MedSurg

segment to our newly created Rhythm and Neuro segment. We have revised prior year amounts to conform to the current year’s presentation (as denoted with an asterisk (*) throughout). There was no revision to operating segments or reporting units as a result of the organizational change.

Emerging Markets

As part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in

Item 1. Business

of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets.

We define Emerging Markets as including


countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors and our global capabilities. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities.

Our Emerging Markets net sales represented

Restructuring and Restructuring-related Activities

In


,


and


, our restructuring and restructuring-related charges remained relatively flat for all periods.

In November 2018, the Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a new global restructuring program (the 2019 Restructuring Plan).

The 2019 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately

$200 million

to

$300 million

and reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $100 million to $150 million by the end of 2022 as program benefits are realized.

The 2016 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately

$275 million

to

$325 million

and is expected to reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $165 million to $175 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized. A substantial portion of the savings from both programs are being reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we have made cumulative cash payments of

$197 million

in association with our 2016 Restructuring Plan.

Litigation-related Net Charges (Credits)

In


,


and


, our litigation-related net charges were primarily in connection with transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims.

We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation, and therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially


adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. Refer to

Tax Rate

The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:

(1)

These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.

The change in our reported tax rate for


, as compared to


and


, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items, litigation-related items, as well as certain discrete tax items. Included in the discrete tax items were the effective settlement of our transfer pricing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2001 through 2010 tax years, the conclusion of the IRS examinations of our 2011 through 2013 tax years, and the final impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), enacted on December 22, 2017.


In 2017, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items, litigation-related items and certain investment impairments. Our reported tax rate for 2017 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to the TCJA.

In 2016, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items and litigation-related items. Our reported tax rate for 2016 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions through settlement or expiration of statute, offset by a charge related to changes in state apportionment.

During 2010 and 2011, we received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation (Guidant) for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and our 2006 and 2007 tax years. The total incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods was

$1.162 billion

plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years was the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott Laboratories in April 2006. During 2014, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008, 2009 and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the IRS applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax years.

We contested in U.S. Tax Court the proposed adjustments from the IRS for Guidant for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and our 2006 and 2007 tax years related to its audit of our transfer pricing methodologies. During 2016, we entered a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the IRS intended to resolve all of the aforementioned transfer pricing issues, as well as issues related to our 2006 transaction with Abbott Laboratories. This stipulation was contingent upon the IRS Office of Appeals applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the 2008 through 2010 tax years.

In the second quarter of 2018, a decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court resolving all disputes related to the transfer pricing issues for Guidant for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and our 2006 and 2007 tax years as well as the tax issues related to our 2006 transaction with Abbott Laboratories. Additionally, we resolved all issues with the IRS Office of Appeals for our 2008 through 2010 tax years, including the transfer pricing issue and other unrelated issues. The final settlement calculation included certain elections made in these relevant years and resulted in a final net tax payment of

$303 million

plus

$307 million

of estimated interest, which was remitted in the second quarter of 2018. Due to the final settlement of these disputes, we recorded a net tax benefit of

$250 million

in 2018.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we received a RAR from the IRS for our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The RAR reflected transfer pricing adjustments consistent with the basis of settlement for all transfer pricing issues agreed to in the Stipulation of Settled Issues. We remitted

$93 million

to the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting the net balance of tax and interest due for these years after consideration of amounts owed to us by the IRS. Due to the resolution of these tax years, we recorded a net tax benefit of

$90 million

.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Based on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of

Cash and cash equivalents

, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt. Please refer to

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

below for additional details on our future payment obligations and commitments.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$146 million

of

Cash and cash equivalents

on hand, comprised of

$13 million

invested in money market and government funds and

$133 million

in interest bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn at market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have access to our

$2.750 billion

commercial paper program, which is backed by our 2018 revolving credit facility entered into on December 19, 2018. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$1.248 billion

in commercial paper debt outstanding resulting in an additional

$1.502 billion

of available liquidity.


For the purpose of funding the proposed BTG Acquisition, as described below, we have access to a bridge facility entered into on November 20, 2018 (Bridge Facility), which is comprised of a

£3.115 billion

debt bridge facility

and a

£200 million

cash bridge facility

for an

aggregate principal amount of

£3.315 billion

. Borrowings from the debt bridge facility mature in 364 days from the date of the first borrowing under the Bridge Facility, and borrowings from the cash bridge facility mature 90 days from the date of the first borrowing under the Bridge Facility. In addition, on December 19, 2018, we entered into a

$1.000 billion

two-year delayed draw term loan credit facility, maturing in two years from the date of the closing of the proposed BTG Acquisition (Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan) and a

$1.000 billion

three-year delayed draw term loan credit facility, maturing in three years from the date of the closing of the proposed BTG Acquisition (Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan). As of

December 31, 2018

, we had no amounts borrowed under the Bridge Facility, the Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan or the Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan.

In December 2018, in connection with our new term loans and currency hedging activities, we reduced the debt bridge facility by an aggregate amount of

£1.569 billion

to a remaining available amount of

£1.546 billion

.

On December 19, 2018 and effective on December 20, 2018, we terminated our

$400 million

credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of

December 31, 2017

.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our

consolidated financial statements

in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

To prepare our

consolidated financial statements

in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent liability, as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (i) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (ii) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liability, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.

See

Note A – Significant Accounting Policies

to our

consolidated financial statements

included in

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see

Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments

and

Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for further discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration,

Note I - Income Taxes

for further discussion of income tax related matters,

Note J – Commitments and Contingencies

for further discussion of legal and product liability matters and

Note O – Revenue

for further discussion of revenue recognition.

Revenue Recognition

Deferred Revenue

We record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received or due in advance of our performance. When we sell a device with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Many of our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. Generally, we do not have observable evidence of the standalone selling price related


to our future service obligations; therefore, we estimate the selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.

Contract liabilities are classified within

Other current liabilities

and

Other long-term liabilities

on our accompanying

consolidated balance sheets

. Our contractual liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE Patient Management System. Revenue is recognized over the average service period which is based on device and patient longevity.

Variable Consideration

We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.

We also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected rebates, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered.

Post Implant Services

We provide non-contractual services to customers to ensure the safe and effective use of certain implanted devices. Since our modified retrospective adoption of

FASB ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

on January 1, 2018, because the revenue related to the immaterial services is recognized before they are delivered, we forward accrue the costs to provide these services at the time the devices are sold. We record these costs to

Selling, general and administrative expenses

. We estimate the amount of time spent by our representatives performing these services and their compensation throughout the device life to determine the service cost. Changes to our business practice or the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of accrued cost. Refer to

Note A – Significant Accounting Policies

and

Note O – Revenue

to our

consolidated financial statements

included in

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

of this Annual Report for further information on our adoption of

FASB ASC Topic 606

and our revenue recognition accounting policies.

Inventory Provisions

We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liability

We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our

consolidated statements of operations

.

Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones.

The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, discount rates, useful life or probability of achieving clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and recognized amortization expense and contingent consideration expense or benefit in current and future periods.


We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or adjustment to the remaining useful life. If we determine it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired based on our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is determined not recoverable

,

we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment.

In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

(

FASB ASC Topic 350

)

.

If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to fair value. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.

Goodwill Valuation

We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual impairment assessment, we identified

seven

reporting units: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation. Beginning in 2016, we aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology reporting units, components of the Rhythm Management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in

FASB ASC Topic 350

.

These reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership, shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016.

Refer to

Note A – Significant Accounting Policies

to our

consolidated financial statements

contained in

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

of this Annual Report for additional details related to our annual goodwill impairment assessments performed in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.

Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, reductions in reimbursement levels, product actions and/or competitive technology developments,

•

declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls,

•

decreases in our forecasted profitability due to an inability to implement successfully and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations,

•

negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products,

•

the level of success of ongoing and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products,


•

the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, supplying the market and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully,

•

changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses and

•

increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and increases in our market-participant tax rate and/or changes in tax laws or macroeconomic conditions.

Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in future impairment charges.

Legal and Product Liability Accruals

In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain, and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us, trial court or appellate proceedings, and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.

Income Taxes

We establish reserves when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged despite our assertion that our tax return positions are fully supportable. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves significant judgment based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in addition to applying complex tax regulations in various jurisdictions across our global operations. Under U.S. GAAP, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must determine it is more likely than not the position will be sustained, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

As part of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, we are subject to a territorial tax system in which we are required to make an accounting policy in providing for tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to treat the impact of GILTI as a period cost and will be reported as a part of continuing operations.

Additional Information

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our

consolidated financial statements

presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share that exclude certain amounts,  operational net sales growth that exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and adjusted free cash flow that excludes certain amounts. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

To calculate adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income as detailed below. Amounts are presented after-tax using our effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with FASB ASC section 740-270-30, "General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate." The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share.

To calculate operational net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior periods. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational growth rate percentages is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis.

To calculate adjusted free cash flow, we exclude the cash component of certain charges (credits) that are also excluded from adjusted net income (earnings) as well as any cash tax benefits of such charges, as detailed below. In addition, we exclude tax settlements payments that relate to prior periods. The GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow on a GAAP basis. Free cash flow on a GAAP basis is calculated by subtracting net purchases of property, plant and equipment from cash provided by operating activities.

Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.

Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.

We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, operational net sales growth that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and adjusted free cash flow that excludes certain amounts, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.

The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items. In each case, management has excluded the item for purposes of calculating the relevant non-GAAP financial measure to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance:

Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow

•

Amortization expense - We record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.


•

Intangible asset impairment charges - This amount represents write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during

2018, 2017 and 2016

.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment and test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. If we determine the carrying value of the amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable or we conclude that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-live asset is impaired

,

we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. Impairment charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

•

Acquisition-related net charges (credits) or payments- These adjustments may consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) due diligence, deal fees, inventory step-up amortization, integration and exit costs, other fees, and accelerated compensation expense; and (d) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of a business or portion of a business. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, deal fees, inventory step-up amortization, integration and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. Separation costs and gains/losses on the sale of a business unit would represent those costs associated with a divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. Acquisition-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

•

Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) or payments - These adjustments primarily represent compensation-related charges, fixed asset write-offs, contract cancellations, project management fees and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans. These restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing, core cost reduction initiatives in terms of, among other things, the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning, resourcing, cost and timing. Examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations and seek regulatory approvals. Restructuring initiatives take place over a defined timeframe and have a distinct project timeline that begins subsequent to approval by our Board of Directors. In contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, restructuring initiatives typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over this period of time, are one-time shut downs or transfers and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. These restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

•

Litigation-related net charges (credits) or payments - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. We record these charges and credits, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant, within the litigation-related charges line in our consolidated statements of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses. Litigation-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

•

Investment impairment charges - These amounts represent write-downs relating to our investment portfolio that are considered unusual or infrequent and significant. Each reporting period, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value and determine if the impairment is other-than-temporary. For other-than-temporary impairments, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. Certain investment impairment charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

•

Discrete tax items -  These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions including those which a) are related to the finalization of the enactment date impact of the TCJA, and, or b) were a benefit resulting from the finalization of the IRS Stipulation of Settled Issues consistent with the manner in which the tax reserves were originally booked. These adjustments are not indicative of expected ongoing operating results. Certain discrete tax items are excluded


from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

Operational Net Sales Excluding the Impact of Foreign Currency Fluctuations

•

The impact of foreign currency fluctuations is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management may exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for purposes of reviewing the net sales and growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans by Executive Officers

Periodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about our company. We disclose details regarding individual Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans on the Investor Relations section of our website.


Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of

December 31, 2018

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report, in which they expressed an unqualified opinion, is included below.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the


consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated

February 19, 2019

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 7A.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.

Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of

$11.326 billion

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$5.923 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $181 million as of

December 31, 2018

as compared to $321 million as of

December 31, 2017

. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $222 million as of

December 31, 2018

as compared to $421 million as of

December 31, 2017

. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our

consolidated statements of operations

.

Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of

$1.000 billion

as of

December 31, 2018

and no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

. As of

December 31, 2018

, $4.800 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 68 percent of our total debt.

Certain of our non-designated forward currency contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018, relate to hedging a portion of the purchase price of the proposed BTG Acquisition (

$2.550 billion

notional value as of

December 31, 2018

). During the first quarter of 2019, we entered into additional non-designated forward currency contracts, after which our combined notional value is

£3.311 billion

, which represents the full purchase price for the proposed BTG Acquisition.

, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at

December 31, 2018

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated

February 19, 2019

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Adoption of ASU No. 2014-09

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for recognizing revenue as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and the amendments in ASUs 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12 effective January 1, 2018.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

When used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our" and "the Company" mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries. We assess the terms of our investment interests to determine if any of our investees meet the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE)

.

For any VIEs, we perform an analysis to determine whether our variable interests give us a controlling financial interest in a VIE. The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Based on our assessments under the applicable guidance, we did not have controlling financial interests in any VIEs and, therefore, did not consolidate any VIEs for

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X.

Amounts reported in millions within this report are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components reported in millions may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in dollars. Balances in 2016 and 2015 balances were subject to rounding.

Revision of Reportable Segments

Effective January 1, 2018, following organizational changes to align the structure of our business with our focus on active implantable devices, we revised our reportable segments, in accordance with

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

.

The revision reflects a reclassification of our Neuromodulation business from our

Medical Surgical (

MedSurg

)

segment to our newly created Rhythm and Neuro segment. We have revised prior year amounts to conform to the current year’s presentation (as denoted with an asterisk (*) throughout). There was no revision to operating segments or reporting units as a result of the organizational change.

Accounting Estimates

To prepare our

consolidated financial statements

in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our

consolidated financial statements

and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Refer to

Critical Accounting Estimates

included in

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

of this Annual Report for further discussion.


Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We record

Cash and cash equivalents

in our

consolidated balance sheets

at cost, which approximates fair value. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk of loss of principal amounts invested and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We consider to be cash equivalents all short-term marketable securities with remaining days to maturity of 90 days or less from the purchase date that can be readily converted to cash.

Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents

Amounts included in restricted cash represent cash on hand required to be set aside by a contractual agreement related to receivable factoring arrangements and deferred compensation plans and are included in the

Other current assets

caption on our

consolidated balance sheets

. Generally, the restrictions related to the factoring arrangements lapse at the time we remit the customer payments collected by us as servicer of previously sold customer receivables to the purchaser. Restrictions for deferred compensation lapse when amounts are paid to the employee. Restricted cash equivalents primarily represent amounts paid into various qualified settlement funds related to our ongoing transvaginal surgical mesh litigation and current amounts related to our non-qualified pension plan and are included in the

Other current assets

caption on our

consolidated balance sheets

. The restrictions related to the various qualified settlement funds will lapse as we approve amounts payable to claimants, at which time we no longer have rights to a return of the amounts paid into the various qualified settlement funds. Restricted cash equivalents included in the

Other long-term assets

caption on our

consolidated balance sheets

are related to the long-term portion of our non-qualified pension plan and deferred compensation plans.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts and notes receivable. Our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions. Counterparties to financial instruments expose us to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance. We transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure. In the normal course, our payment terms with customers, including hospitals, healthcare agencies, clinics, doctors' offices and other private and governmental institutions, are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets and generally do not require collateral. We record our Accounts receivable in our

consolidated balance sheets

at net realizable value. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, based on historical information and management's best estimates. We write-off amounts determined to be uncollectible against this reserve. Write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable were immaterial in


,


and


. We are not dependent on any single institution, and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in


,


and


; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our U.S. net sales.

We closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international economies. Our European sales to government-owned or supported customers in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding relative to other countries prior to payment. Historically, receivable balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals in these countries accumulated over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments. While we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of

December 31, 2018

and


, if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers, and our write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable may increase.

Revenue Recognition

ASC Update No. 2014-09

In May 2014, the FASB issued

FASB ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(Topic 606), which was subsequently updated. We adopted the standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, we applied

FASB ASC Topic 606

to contracts that were not complete as of January 1, 2018 and recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Results for reporting periods beginning after


January 1, 2018 are presented in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 606

. Prior period amounts are not adjusted and are reported in accordance with legacy GAAP requirements in

FASB ASC Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

.

Due to the adoption of

FASB ASC Topic 606

, we recorded a net reduction to retained earnings of

$177 million

on January 1, 2018, primarily related to the cost of providing non-contractual post-implant support to certain customers, which we historically deemed immaterial in the context of the arrangement. Upon the adoption of

FASB ASC Topic 606

, when we sell a device with an implied non-contractual post-implant support obligation, we forward accrue the cost of the service within

Selling, general and administrative expenses

and recognize it at the point in time the associated revenue is earned. We release the accrual over the related service period. These costs were previously expensed as incurred due to such service obligation being non-contractual.

The impact of adopting

FASB ASC Topic 606

on our

consolidated balance sheets

resulted in

an increase

in

Other current liabilities

of

$59 million

and

an increase

in

Other long-term liabilities

of

$205 million

as of

December 31, 2018

, as a result of accruing for our post-implant support obligation. We also recorded deferred tax assets primarily related to post-implant support, resulting in

an increase

in

Other long-term assets

of

$12 million

and

a reduction

in

Deferred income taxes

of

$41 million

as of

December 31, 2018

. The remaining impact of adopting

FASB ASC Topic 606

was not material to our financial position or results of operations.

We sell our products primarily through a direct sales force. In certain international markets, we sell our products through independent distributors. We consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met:

•

We have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations,

•

Promised products or services are identified,

•

The transaction price, or the amount we expect to receive, is determinable and

•

We have transferred control of the promised items to the customer.

Transfer of control is evidenced upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer unless we are required to provide additional services. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record these costs as a selling expense when incurred. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. We recognize a receivable at the point in time we have an unconditional right to payment. Payment terms are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets.

Deferred Revenue

We record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received or due in advance of our performance. When we sell a device with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Many of our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. Generally, we do not have observable evidence of the standalone selling price related to our future service obligations; therefore, we estimate the selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.

Contract liabilities are classified within

Other current liabilities

and

Other long-term liabilities

on our accompanying

consolidated balance sheets

. Our contractual liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE Patient Management System. Revenue is recognized over the average service period which is based on device and patient longevity. We have elected not to disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less. In addition, we have not identified material unfulfilled performance obligations for which revenue is not currently deferred.

Variable Consideration

We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.


We also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected rebates, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above.

Capitalized Contract Costs

We capitalize commission fees related to contracts with customers when the associated revenue is expected to be earned over a period that exceeds one year. Deferred commissions are primarily related to the sale of devices enabled with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System. We have elected to expense commission costs when incurred for contracts with an expected duration of one year or less. Capitalized commission fees are amortized over the period the associated products or services are transferred. Similarly, we capitalize certain recoverable costs related to the delivery of the LATITUDE Remote Monitoring Service. These fulfillment costs are amortized over the average service period. Our total capitalized contract costs are immaterial to our

consolidated financial statements

.

Post Implant Services

We provide non-contractual services to customers to ensure the safe and effective use of certain implanted devices. Since our modified retrospective adoption of

FASB ASC Topic 606

on January 1, 2018, because the revenue related to the immaterial services is recognized before they are delivered, we forward accrue the costs to provide these services at the time the devices are sold. We record these costs to

Selling, general and administrative expenses

. We estimate the amount of time spent by our representatives performing these services and their compensation throughout the device life to determine the service cost. Changes to our business practice or the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of accrued cost.

Warranty Obligations

We offer warranties on certain of our product offerings. The majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our CRM business, which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems. Our CRM products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices. We offer a full warranty for a portion of the period post-implant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter. We estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessary. Aggregate year over year changes in our product warranty accrual during


,


and


were immaterial.

Inventories

We state inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or net realizable value. We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory. Approximately

40 percent

of our finished goods inventory as of both

December 31, 2018

and December 31,


was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representatives.

Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant, equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost. We charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset. We provide for depreciation using the straight-line method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings over a maximum life of


years; building improvements over the remaining useful life of the building structure; equipment, furniture and fixtures over a

three

to

seven

year life; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease.


Valuation of Business Combinations

We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development (IPR&D), which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate to goodwill any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through

Selling, general and administrative expenses

.

In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through

Contingent consideration expense (benefit)

on our

consolidated statements of operations

.

Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones.

Payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones after the acquisition date, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets and/or obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development at the date of the acquisition.

Indefinite-lived Intangibles, including IPR&D

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, include acquired balloon and other technology, which is foundational to our ongoing operations within the Cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and IPR&D intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Our IPR&D represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility, regardless of whether they have alternative future use. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We classify IPR&D acquired in a business combination as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon completion of the associated research and development efforts, we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives. Upon permanent abandonment, we write-off the remaining carrying amount of the associated IPR&D intangible asset.

We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. In addition, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or impairment indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

.

If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.

We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our IPR&D. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of other acquired assets, the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology. See

Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for more information related to indefinite-lived intangibles, including IPR&D.

For asset purchases outside of business combinations, we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date.

Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets

We record definite-lived intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. We use a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined. The approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows: patents and licenses,

two

to


years; amortizable technology-related and customer relationships,

five

to


years; other intangible assets, various.


We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If we determine it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired based on our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset or asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset or asset group, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period impairment is identified.

We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset or asset group. See

Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for more information related to impairments of intangible assets.

For patents developed internally, we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents, including attorney fees, registration fees, consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent.

Goodwill Valuation

We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual impairment assessment, we identified

seven

reporting units: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation. We aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology reporting units, components of the Rhythm Management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in

FASB ASC Topic 350

.

These reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership, shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016.

In performing the goodwill impairment assessments for 2018, 2017 and 2016, we utilized both the optional qualitative assessment and the quantitative approach prescribed under

FASB ASC Topic 350

. The qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent. All other reporting units were tested using the quantitative approach described below. The qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other entity-specific factors. After assessing the totality of events, if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further steps are required. If it is determined that impairment is more likely than not, then we perform the quantitative impairment test. In 2018, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation reporting units since their fair values have exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent. The remaining reporting units were quantitatively tested for impairment. For all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment, no further steps were required, and we concluded such reporting units were not impaired. For all reporting units tested using the quantitative approach, we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.

For our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual impairment assessments, for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performed, we used only the income approach, specifically the Discounted Cash Flow method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate


the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.

In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our Discounted Cash Flow analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.

Investments in Publicly Traded and Privately Held Entities

ASC Update No. 2016-01

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-01,

Financial Instruments - Overall

(Subtopic 825-10)

: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.

The purpose of Update No. 2016-01 is to improve financial reporting for financial instruments by reducing the number of items recorded to other comprehensive income. We adopted Update No. 2016-01 in the first quarter of 2018, using both the modified retrospective and prospective methods. For publicly-held securities, we used the modified retrospective approach. Unrealized gains and losses previously recorded to

Other comprehensive income (loss)

were reclassified to retained earnings,

and all future fair value changes will be recorded to

Net income (loss)

. For privately-held securities that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, we elected the measurement alternative approach for our existing investments, which is applied prospectively upon adoption. This approach requires entities to measure their investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. The actual impact to future periods resulting from fair value changes of our equity investments is difficult to predict as it will depend on their future performance.

In 2017 and 2016, we accounted for our publicly traded investments as available-for-sale securities based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period. Unrealized holding gains or losses during the period, net of tax, were recorded to

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax

. We computed realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities at fair value, adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. We accounted for investments in private entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 325

,

Investments - Other

.

We account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a VIE in which we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 323,

Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures

. We record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing

consolidated financial statements

. Lastly, we have notes receivable from certain companies that we account for in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 320

, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities

. Refer to

Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments

for additional details on our investment balances.

Each reporting period, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Examples of such impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance, recent financing rounds at reduced valuations, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value. Our estimation of fair value considers financial information related to the investee available to us, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value if accounted for under measurement alternative. For our equity method investments, an impairment loss is recorded if we determine the impairment is other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary unless available evidence indicates that the valuation is more likely than not to recover up to the carrying value of the investment in a reasonable period of time, and we have both the ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time needed to recover the value. For other-than-temporary impairments, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an


investment’s carrying value and its fair value. Impairment losses on our investments are included in

consolidated statements of operations

Income Taxes

ASC Update No. 2016-16

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-16,

Income Taxes

(Topic 740):

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

. The purpose of Update No. 2016-16 is to allow an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, as opposed to waiting until the asset is sold to a third party, or impaired. Update No. 2016-16 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. We adopted Update No. 2016-16 prospectively in the first quarter of 2018 and recognized a net reduction to opening retained earnings of

$55 million

for income tax consequences not previously recognized for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventories. All future income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventories will be recognized through

Income tax expense (benefit)

.

We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as estimates of the impact of future taxable income and available prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. As part of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), we are subject to a territorial tax system in which we are required to make an accounting policy in providing for tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to treat the impact of GILTI as a period cost and will be reported as a part of continuing operations. See

Note I - Income Taxes

for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balances including a discussion of the impacts of the TCJA.

Legal and Product Liability Costs

In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are also the subject of certain governmental investigations, which could result in substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue our best estimate of the minimum amount of the range. We analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement. We allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an ongoing future benefit.

Compensation - Nonretirement and Postemployment Benefits

, if we pay the benefits as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement, which includes benefits provided as part of our established severance policies or that we provide in accordance with international statutory requirements. We accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributable to prior services rendered, the rights to the benefits have vested, the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate the liability. We account for employee termination benefits that represent a one-time benefit in accordance with

Translation of Foreign Currency

We translate all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries from the functional currency, which is generally the local currency, into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rate and translate revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. We show the net effect of these translation adjustments in our

consolidated financial statements

ASC Update No. 2017-12

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2017-12,

Derivatives and Hedging

(Topic 815)

: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

. The purpose of Update No. 2017-12 is to simplify the application of hedge accounting and better align financial reporting of hedging relationships with risk management objectives. Update No. 2017-12 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. We early adopted Update No. 2017-12 in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

We recognize all derivative financial instruments in our

consolidated financial statements

at fair value in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 815

, Derivatives and Hedging

, and we present assets and liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our financial statements. In accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 815

, for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for, and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship, as well as on the type of hedging relationship. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset gains and losses on the item being hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes, and we do not have any non-derivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to

FASB ASC Topic 815

. Refer to

Note D – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements

Proposed BTG Acquisition

On November 20, 2018, our board of directors and the board of directors of our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, Bravo Bidco Limited (Bidco), and BTG plc (BTG), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales, issued an announcement (the Rule 2.7 Announcement) under Rule 2.7 of the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, disclosing the terms of a recommended cash offer to be made by Bidco for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of BTG (the proposed BTG Acquisition). On January 24, 2019, Bidco made such offer on the terms and subject to the conditions of the scheme document published on the same date.

In connection with the proposed BTG Acquisition, (i) we entered into a co-operation agreement with Bidco and BTG

(the Co-operation Agreement)

, (ii) certain shareholders and each BTG director owning shares of BTG delivered deeds of irrevocable undertakings to Bidco and (iii) we entered into a bridge credit agreement (the Bridge Facility).

Refer to

Note E – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements

for further details of the Bridge Facility. On February 14, 2019, each of the Company and BTG received a request for additional information and documentary material from the United States Federal Trade Commission in connection with the proposed BTG Acquisition.

Under the terms of the proposed BTG Acquisition, BTG shareholders will receive

840 pence

in cash for each BTG share, which values BTG’s existing issued and to be issued ordinary share capital at approximately

£3.311 billion

(or approximately

$4.225 billion

based on the exchange rate of U.S.

$1.28

:

£1.00

on December 31, 2018).

We intend to implement the proposed BTG Acquisition by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement (Scheme) under Part 26 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006, as amended (the Companies Act).

The proposed BTG Acquisition will be subject to conditions and certain further terms, including (i) the approval of the Scheme by a majority in number of BTG shareholders also representing not less than

75 percent

in value of the BTG shares, in each case, present, entitled to vote and voting, (ii) the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court of Justice in England and Wales, (iii) the Scheme becoming effective no later than August 20, 2019 and (iv) the receipt of regulatory approvals. The conditions to the proposed BTG Acquisition are set out in full in the Rule 2.7 Announcement. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, we expect the proposed BTG Acquisition to be effective in the first half of 2019.

We are entitled to implement the proposed BTG Acquisition by way of a takeover offer (as defined in Part 28 of the Companies Act) in certain circumstances, subject to the terms of the Co-operation Agreement and the consent of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers in the United Kingdom.

Pursuant to the Co-operation Agreement, the Company and Bidco have undertaken to use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the required regulatory clearances in respect of the proposed BTG Acquisition as soon as reasonably practicable, to provide each other with such information and assistance as may reasonably be required for the purpose of making any filing, notification or submission to relevant antitrust and regulatory authorities, and Bidco has agreed to provide BTG with information required for the preparation of Scheme documentation. The Co-operation Agreement addresses certain other matters, as set forth therein.

Invesco Asset Management Limited subsequently sold certain BTG shares, subject to its irrevocable undertaking, to certain funds managed by Pentwater Capital Management Europe LLP (together, the Pentwater Funds) and Woodford Investment Management Limited sold all of the BTG shares subject to its irrevocable undertaking to Arrowgrass Master Fund Limited and Anavio Capital Master Fund Limited and funds managed, variously, by Anavio Capital Partners LLP, Sand Grove Capital Management LLP, Tavira Securities and Melquart Asset Management (UK) Ltd. (all together with the Pentwater Funds, the New Shareholders). These BTG shares remain subject to deeds of irrevocable undertakings under which each New Shareholder is committed, among other things, to vote its BTG shares in favor of the Scheme and against any proposal that would impede or frustrate the completion of the proposed BTG Acquisition.


The Shareholder Undertakings and the Director Undertakings will remain in effect if the Company and Bidco elect to effect the proposed BTG Acquisition by way of a takeover offer and will cease to be binding in certain circumstances.

BTG develops and commercializes products used in minimally-invasive procedures targeting cancer and vascular diseases, as well as acute care pharmaceuticals.

The following summarizes the aggregated purchase price allocations for our 2016 acquisitions:

We allocated a portion of the purchase prices to specific intangible asset categories as follows:

For our

2018, 2017 and 2016

acquisitions, our technology-related intangible assets consist of technical processes, intellectual property and institutional understanding with respect to products and processes that we will leverage in future products or processes and will carry forward from one product generation to the next. We used the multi-period excess earnings method, a variation of the income approach and relief from royalty approach to derive the fair value of the technology-related intangible assets and are amortizing them on a straight-line basis over their assigned estimated useful lives.

Other intangible assets primarily include acquired customer relationships and tradenames. Customer relationships represent the estimated fair value of non-contractual customer, payor and distributor relationships. Customer relationships are direct relationships with physicians and hospitals performing procedures with the acquired products, payor relationships are contracts and relationships with healthcare payors relating to reimbursement of services and distributor relationships are relationships with third parties used


to sell the acquired products, all as of the acquisition date. These relationships were valued separately from goodwill because there is a history and pattern of conducting business with customers and distributors. We used the income approach or the replacement cost and lost profits methodology to derive the fair value of the customer relationships. The customer relationships intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their assigned estimated useful lives. Tradenames include brand names that we expect to continue using in our product portfolio and related marketing materials. The tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty methodology and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their assigned estimated useful lives.

We believe that the estimated intangible asset values represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the assets. These fair value measurements are based on significant unobservable inputs, including management estimates and assumptions and, accordingly, are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy prescribed by

FASB ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

.

Goodwill was established due primarily to synergies expected to be gained from leveraging our existing operations as well as revenue and cash flow projections associated with future technologies and has been allocated to our reportable segments based on the relative expected benefit. Based on preliminary estimates, the goodwill recorded related to our


acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recorded related to our


acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. Of the goodwill recorded related to our 2016 acquisitions,

$116 million

is deductible for tax purposes. Refer to

Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for more information related to goodwill allocated to our reportable segments.

Contingent Consideration

Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability were as follows:

As of

December 31, 2018

, the maximum amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to pay was approximately

$873 million

. The maximum amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) decreased approximately

$447 million

compared to the amount as of

December 31, 2017

due primarily to the expiration of certain contingent consideration arrangements in 2018.

The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent consideration liabilities include the following significant unobservable inputs:


Projected contingent payment amounts related to some of our R&D, commercialization-based and revenue-based milestones are discounted back to the current period using a Discounted Cash Flow model. Projected revenues are based on our most recent internal operational budgets and strategic plans. Increases or decreases in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates or the time until payment may result in materially different fair value measurements.

Strategic Investments

The aggregate carrying amounts of our strategic investments were comprised of the following categories:

These investments are classified as

Other long-term assets

within our accompanying

consolidated balance sheets

, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the cost of our aggregated equity method investments exceeded our share of the underlying equity in net assets by approximately

$334 million

, which represents amortizable intangible assets, IPR&D, deferred tax liabilities and goodwill.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the cost of our aggregated equity method investments exceeded our share of the underlying equity in net assets by approximately

$212 million

, which represents amortizable intangible assets, IPR&D, deferred tax liabilities and goodwill.

NOTE C – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The gross carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization for intangible assets subject to amortization and accumulated write-offs of goodwill are as follows:

In the third quarter of

NOTE D – HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We address market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through risk management programs which include the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate these programs pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies and do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as the gains or losses on these derivatives generally offset losses or gains recognized on the hedged item.

We manage concentration of counterparty credit risk by limiting acceptable counterparties to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of credit exposure to individual counterparties and by actively monitoring counterparty credit ratings and the amount of individual credit exposure. We also employ master netting arrangements that limit the risk of counterparty non-payment on a particular settlement date to the net gain that would have otherwise been received from the counterparty. Although not completely eliminated, we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant as a result of these protections. Further, none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral or other security arrangements, nor do they contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.

Currency Derivative Instruments

Risk Management Strategy

Our risk from changes in currency exchange rates consists primarily of monetary assets and liabilities, forecast intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We manage currency exchange rate risk at a consolidated level to reduce the cost of hedging by taking advantage of offsetting transactions. We employ derivative instruments, primarily forward currency contracts, to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates.


The success of our currency risk management program depends, in part, on forecast transactions denominated primarily in British pound sterling, Euro and Japanese yen. We may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent the actual activity is different than forecast. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flows.

Derivative Designations and Hedging Relationships

Certain of our currency derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under

FASB ASC Topic 815

, Derivatives and Hedging

, and are intended to protect the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the

Net change in derivative financial instruments

component of

Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax (OCI)

on our

consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)

until the underlying third-party transaction occurs. When the underlying third-party transaction occurs, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings within the

Cost of products sold

caption of our

consolidated statements of operations

. In the event the hedging relationship is no longer effective, or if the hedged forecast transaction becomes no longer probable of occurring, we reclassify the gains or losses within

AOCI

to earnings at that time.

We also designate certain currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in the Euro, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen. We have elected to use the spot method to assess effectiveness for our derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges. Under the spot method, the change in fair value attributable to changes in the spot rate is recorded in the

Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA)

component of

OCI

. We have elected to exclude the spot-forward difference from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are amortizing this amount separately, as calculated at the date of designation, on a straight-line basis over the term of the currency forward contracts. Amortization of the spot-forward difference is then reclassified from

AOCI

to current period earnings as a reduction to

Interest expense

on our

consolidated statements of operations

.

We also use forward currency contracts that are not part of designated hedging relationships under

FASB ASC Topic 815

as a part of our strategy to manage our exposure to currency exchange rate risk related to monetary assets and liabilities and related forecast transactions. These non-designated currency forward contracts have an original time to maturity consistent with the hedged currency transaction exposures, generally less than one year, and are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings within the

Other, net

caption of our

consolidated statements of operations

.

Certain of our non-designated forward currency contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018, relate to hedging a portion of the purchase price of the proposed BTG Acquisition (

$2.550 billion

notional value as of

December 31, 2018

). During the first quarter of 2019, we entered into additional non-designated forward currency contracts, after which our combined notional value is

£3.311 billion

, which represents the full purchase price for the proposed BTG Acquisition.

Interest Rate Derivative Instruments

Risk Management Strategy

Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. Under these agreements we and the counterparty, at specified intervals, exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 815

.

Derivative Designations and Hedging Relationships

Certain of our interest rate derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are intended to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in the benchmark interest rate in connection with the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into interest rate derivative contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, having a notional amount of

$1.000 billion

to hedge interest rate risk. We record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives within

OCI

until the underlying hedged transaction occurs, at which time we recognize the gain or loss within

Interest expense

over the same period that the hedged items affect earnings, so long as the hedge relationship remains effective. If we determine the hedging relationship is no longer effective, or if the hedged forecast transaction becomes no longer probable of occurring, we reclassify the amount of gains or losses from

AOCI

to earnings at that time. Prior to the adoption of ASC Update No. 2017-12,

Derivatives and Hedging

(Topic 815), the ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in earnings in the period in which the hedging relationship exhibited ineffectiveness.


We previously terminated interest rate derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow hedges and are reclassifying the amortization of the gains or losses from

AOCI

into earnings as a component of

Interest expense

over the same period that the hedged items affect earnings, so long as the hedge relationship remains effective. The balance of the deferred gains on our terminated cash flow hedges within

AOCI

was immaterial as of

December 31, 2018

and

December 31, 2017

. We recognized immaterial gains in

Interest expense

relating to the amortization of the terminated cash flow hedges in the current and prior periods.

We had no interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as of

December 31, 2018

and

December 31, 2017

. We previously terminated interest rate derivative instruments that were designated as fair value hedges and are recognizing the amortization of the gains or losses originally recorded within the

Long-term debt

caption on our

consolidated balance sheets

into earnings as a component of

Interest expense

over the same period that the discount or premium associated with the hedged items affect earnings. In the event that we designate outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as fair value hedges, we record the changes in the fair values of interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges and of the underlying hedged debt instruments in

Interest expense

, which generally offset. The balance of the deferred gains on our terminated fair value hedges within

Long-term debt

was immaterial as of

December 31, 2018

and

December 31, 2017

. We recognized immaterial gains in

Interest expense

relating to the amortization of the terminated fair value hedges in the current and prior periods.

The following table presents the contractual amounts of our derivative instruments outstanding:

The remaining time to maturity as of

December 31, 2018

is within


months for all designated forward currency contracts and generally less than one year for all non-designated forward currency contracts.


The following presents the effect of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges under

for the total amounts relating to derivative instruments presented within the

consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)

In all periods presented in the table above, the pre-tax (gain) loss amounts reclassified from

(2)

For our outstanding net investment hedges, the net gain or loss reclassified from

AOCI

to earnings as a reduction of

Interest expense

represents the straight-line amortization of the excluded component as calculated at the date of designation. This initial value of the excluded component has been excluded from the assessment of effectiveness in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 815

. In the current period, we did not recognize any gains or losses on the components included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in

AOCI

or earnings.

Fair Value Measurements

FASB ASC Topic 815

requires all derivative instruments to be recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by

FASB ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, and considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the creditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and our own creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, we may utilize financial models to measure fair value of our derivative instruments. In doing so, we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. The following are the balances of our derivative assets and liabilities:

(1)

We classify derivative assets and liabilities as current when the settlement date of the derivative contract is one year or less.


Recurring Fair Value Measurements

On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available, we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value.

FASB ASC Topic 820

establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The category of a financial asset or a financial liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:

•

Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and market-corroborated inputs.

•

Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based on management’s best estimate of inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:

Our investments in money market and government funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. These investments are classified as

Cash and cash equivalents

within our accompanying

consolidated balance sheets

, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies. In addition to

$13 million

invested in money market and government funds as of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$133 million

in interest bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts. In addition to

$21 million

invested in money market and government funds as of

December 31, 2017

, we had

$167 million

in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts.

Our recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs relate solely to our contingent consideration liability. Refer to

Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments

for a discussion of the changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements

We hold certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods after initial recognition. The fair value of a measurement alternative investment is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Refer to

Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments

for a discussion of our strategic investments.

Refer to

Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for a discussion of the fair values.

The fair value of our outstanding debt obligations was

$7.239 billion

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$5.945 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

. We determined fair value by using quoted market prices for our publicly registered senior notes, classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, amortized cost for commercial paper and face value for term loans and credit facility borrowings outstanding. Refer to

Note E – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements

for a discussion of our debt obligations.


NOTE E – BORROWINGS AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

We had total debt of

$7.056 billion

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$5.616 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

. The debt maturity schedule for our long-term debt obligations is presented below:

Note:

The table above does not include unamortized amounts related to interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

(1)

Corporate credit rating improvements may result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate on our November 2035 Notes to the extent that our lowest credit rating is above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November 2035 Notes will be permanently reinstated to the issuance rate if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A- or A3 or higher.

Revolving Credit Facility

On December 19, 2018, we entered into a

$2.750 billion

revolving credit facility (the 2018 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous

$2.250 billion

revolving credit facility (the 2017 Facility), which was scheduled to mature in August 2022. The 2018 Facility will mature on December 19, 2023 with one-year extension options subject to certain conditions. Eurodollar and multicurrency loans bear interest at the Eurocurrency Rate determined for the interest period plus the applicable margin, based on our corporate credit ratings (

1.02 percent

as of

December 31, 2018

). ABR loans bear interest at ABR plus the applicable margin of up to

0.40 percent

, based on our corporate credit ratings. Under the credit agreement for the 2018 Facility (the 2018 Credit Agreement), we are required to pay a facility fee (

0.11 percent

as of

December 31, 2018

) based on our credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit commitment, regardless of usage of the 2018 Facility. This facility provides backing for the commercial paper program described below. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facilities as of

December 31, 2018

or

December 31, 2017

.

Bridge Facility

On November 20, 2018, we entered into the Bridge Facility in

aggregate principal amount of

£3.315 billion

for the purpose of financing the proposed BTG Acquisition. The Bridge Facility is comprised of a

£3.115 billion

debt bridge facility

, borrowings under which mature


days from the date of the first borrowing under the Bridge Facility, and a

£200 million

cash bridge facility

, borrowings under which mature


days from the date of the first borrowing under the Bridge Facility. Borrowings are available in British pound sterling or U.S. dollar and bear interest at the LIBOR for borrowings in British pound sterling or U.S. dollar, as applicable, or the base rate for borrowings in U.S. dollars, in each case plus an applicable margin based on our public debt ratings. The Bridge Facility also provides for customary ticking fees based on our public debt ratings and duration fees. The Bridge Facility requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as described within

Debt Covenants

below. The Bridge Facility contains customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of any outstanding commitments and also contains customary United Kingdom (U.K.) certain funds provisions. There were no amounts borrowed under the Bridge Facility as of

December 31, 2018

.

In December 2018, in connection with our new term loans and currency hedging activities, we reduced the debt bridge


facility by an aggregate amount of

£1.569 billion

to a remaining available amount of

£1.546 billion

. Refer to

Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments

for a discussion of our currency hedging activities.

Term Loans

On December 19, 2018, we entered into the First Amendment to our

$1.000 billion

Term Loan Credit Agreement (August 2019 Term Loan), which was originally entered into August 20, 2018, which matures on August 19, 2019 and is presented within

Current debt obligations

in the accompanying

consolidated balance sheets

. Borrowings under the August 2019 Term Loan bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus

0.65 percent

. The August 2019 Term Loan requires that we comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants as described within

Debt Covenants

below. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$1.000 billion

outstanding under our August 2019 Term Loan. We used the proceeds from the August 2019 Term Loan to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper.

On December 19, 2018, we entered into a

$2.000 billion

senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility consisting of a

$1.000 billion

two-year delayed draw term loan credit facility maturing in two years from the date of the closing of the proposed BTG Acquisition (Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan) and a

$1.000 billion

three-year delayed draw term loan credit facility maturing in three years from the date of the closing of the proposed BTG Acquisition (Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan). Borrowings are available in U.S. dollars and bear interest at LIBOR or a base rate in each case plus an applicable margin based on our public debt ratings. We are required to pay customary ticking fees on the average daily unused commitments based on our public debt ratings. The facilities contain customary representations and covenants, as described within

Debt Covenants

below. The facilities contain customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of any outstanding commitments, and also contains customary U.K. certain funds provisions. Any proceeds from the facilities will be available to refinance in part the commitments outstanding under the Bridge Facility, described above, to finance the proposed BTG Acquisition. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had no amounts borrowed under the Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan or the Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan.

Debt Covenants

As of and through

December 31, 2018

, we were in compliance with all the required covenants related to our debt obligations.

All existing credit arrangements described above require that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows:

(1) Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreements, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.

Our covenants require that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio of

3.75 times

, provided, however, that for the two consecutive fiscal quarters ended immediately following the consummation of a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by each agreement below, the maximum leverage ratio shall be

4.75 times

, and then subject to a step-down for each succeeding fiscal quarter end to

4.5 times

,

4.25 times

,

4.00 times

and then back to

3.75 times

for each fiscal quarter end thereafter. Our covenants provide for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreements, through maturity, of any non-cash charges and up to

$500 million

in restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses related to our current or future restructuring plans. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$350 million

of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreements, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreements, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed

$2.624 billion

in the aggregate. As of

December 31, 2018

, we had approximately

$1.191 billion

of the legal exclusion remaining.

A Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the 2018 Credit Agreement and August 2019 Term Loan, includes but is not limited to the proposed BTG Acquisition. A Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the Bridge Facility, Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, is limited to the proposed BTG Acquisition and any other transaction permitted under the Bridge Facility and consummated on or after the Closing date, as defined by the Bridge Facility.

Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers on terms acceptable to us. In this case, all credit facility commitments would terminate, and any amounts borrowed under the facility would become immediately due and payable. Furthermore, any termination of our credit facility may negatively impact the credit ratings assigned to our commercial paper program which may impact our ability to refinance any then outstanding commercial paper as it becomes due and payable

.


Commercial Paper

Outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity and is backed by the 2018 Facility.

Senior Notes

We had senior notes outstanding of

$4.800 billion

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$4.400 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

.

In February 2018, we completed an offering of

$1.000 billion

in aggregate principal amount of

4.000%

senior notes, due March 2028. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the

$600 million

plus accrued interest of our

2.650%

senior notes due in October 2018, which were classified as short-term debt as of December 31, 2017. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper.

Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if borrowed by our subsidiaries and to liabilities of our subsidiaries (see

Other Arrangements

below).

Our

$4.450 billion

of senior notes issued in 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2018 contain a change-in-control provision, which provides that each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to

101 percent

of the aggregate repurchased principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if a rating event, as defined in the indenture, occurs as a result of a change-in-control, as defined in the indenture. Any other credit rating changes may impact our borrowing cost, but do not require us to repay any borrowings.

Other Arrangements

On December 19, 2018 and effective on December 20, 2018, we terminated our

$400 million

credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of

December 31, 2017

.

We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries and with commercial banks in Japan which include promissory notes discounting programs. We account for our factoring programs as sales under

FASB ASC Topic 860,

Transfers and Servicing

. We have no retained interest in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administration, and once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Amounts de-recognized for accounts and notes receivable, which are excluded from

Trade accounts receivable, net

in the accompanying

consolidated balance sheets

, are aggregated by contract denominated currency below (in millions):

(1)

The capacities are translated from local currency to U.S. dollar using the spot rates on the last business day of each period.

(2)

The factoring arrangements denominated in Japanese yen consist of two arrangements, one with a maximum capacity of

22.000 billion

yen, which has been discontinued in the second quarter of 2018, and a new arrangement with a maximum capacity of

30.000 billion

yen entered into in March 2018.

NOTE G – RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ACTIVITIES

2019 Restructuring Plan

On November 15, 2018, the Board of Directors approved, and we committed to a new global restructuring program (the 2019 Restructuring Plan). The 2019 Restructuring Plan is

intended to support our effort to improve operating performance and meet anticipated market demands by ensuring that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients and customers.

Key activities under the 2019 Restructuring Plan include supply chain network optimization intended to maximize our global manufacturing and distribution network capacity and building functional capabilities that support business growth.

These activities are expected to be initiated in 2019, with the majority of activity expected to be complete by the end of 2021.

The following table provides a summary of our estimates of total pre-tax charges associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan by major type of cost:

(1)

Consists primarily of consultant fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.

(2)

Comprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation, fixed asset write-offs, and costs to transfer product lines among facilities.

Approximately

$180 million

to

$280 million

of these charges are expected to result in cash outlays.


2016 Restructuring Plan

On June 6, 2016, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to a restructuring initiative (the 2016 Restructuring Plan). The 2016 Restructuring Plan is

intended to develop global commercialization, technology and manufacturing capabilities in key growth markets, build on our Plant Network Optimization (PNO) strategy which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and expand operational efficiencies in support of our operating income margin goals.

Key activities under the 2016 Restructuring Plan include strengthening global infrastructure through evolving global real estate assets and workplaces, developing global commercial and technical competencies, enhancing manufacturing and distribution expertise in certain regions and continuing implementation of our PNO strategy.

These activities were initiated

in the second quarter of 2016 and the majority of the costs associated with this Plan were completed by the end of 2018. We revised the original estimate for the costs and savings associated with the program in the first quarter of 2018, as approved by the Board of Directors.

The following table provides a summary of our estimates of total pre-tax charges associated with the 2016 Restructuring Plan by major type of cost:

(1)

Consists primarily of consulting fees and costs associated with contract cancellations.

(2)

Comprised of other costs directly related to the 2016 Restructuring Plan, including program management, accelerated depreciation, fixed asset write-offs and costs to transfer product lines among facilities.

Approximately

$250 million

to

$300 million

of these charges are estimated to result in cash outlays.

The following presents the restructuring and restructuring-related charges (credits) by major type and line item within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in millions):


Expenses in 2016 include costs associated with the 2016 Restructuring Plan and expenses associated with other substantially completed plans.

The following table presents cumulative restructuring and restructuring-related charges incurred as of

The related benefit for income taxes consisted of the following:

The reconciliation of income taxes at the federal statutory rate to the actual benefit for income taxes is as follows:

(1)

Due to the inclusion of new tax provisions in 2018 created by the TJCA, we have reclassified select items in prior years to align with the new categories established in 2018, domestic taxes on foreign earnings and uncertain tax positions.


Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Our deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and prepaid on intercompany profit, are included in the following locations within our accompanying consolidated balance sheets (in millions):

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had U.S. federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, the tax effect of which was

$416 million

. As of

December 31, 2017

, we had U.S. federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, the tax effect of which was

$338 million

. In addition, we had foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, the tax effect of which was

$42 million

as of

December 31, 2018

, as compared to

$149 million

as of

December 31, 2017

. These tax attributes will expire periodically beginning in 2019.

After consideration of all positive and negative evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established a valuation allowance of

$344 million

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$465 million

as of

December 31, 2017

, representing a

decrease

of

$121 million

. The

decrease

in the valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2018

, as compared to

December 31, 2017

, is primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowances against expiring net operation losses and utilization of deferred tax assets. The income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income and stockholders' equity was a charge of

$37 million

in


, a benefit of

$63 million

in


and a charge of

$9 million

in


.


We obtain tax incentives through Free Trade Zone Regime offered in Costa Rica which allows 100.0 percent exemption from income tax in the first eight years of operations and 50.0 percent exemption in the following four years. This tax incentive resulted in income tax savings of

$146 million

for


,

$127 million

for


and

$123 million

for


. The tax incentive for 100.0 percent exemption from income tax is expected to expire in 2023. The impact on per share earnings was

$0.10

for


and

$0.09

for both


and


. Additionally, we benefit from tax incentives in Puerto Rico. The income tax savings from Puerto Rico were immaterial for

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$427 million

of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net

$332 million

, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of

December 31, 2017

, we had

$1.238 billion

of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net

$1.150 billion

, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

$1.095 billion

of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net

$1.006 billion

, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

We are subject to U.S. Federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2013, with the exception of select issues in 2011 and substantially all material state and local income tax matters through 2010. We have concluded all foreign income tax matters through 2013, with the exception of issues for Italy, which have concluded through 2002.

During 2010 and 2011, we received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation (Guidant) for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and our 2006 and 2007 tax years. The total incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods was

$1.162 billion

plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years was the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott Laboratories in April 2006. During 2014, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008, 2009 and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the IRS applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax years.

We contested in U.S. Tax Court the proposed adjustments from the IRS for Guidant for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and our 2006 and 2007 tax years related to its audit of our transfer pricing methodologies. During 2016, we entered a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the IRS intended to resolve all of the aforementioned transfer pricing issues, as well as issues related to our 2006 transaction with Abbott Laboratories. This stipulation was contingent upon the IRS Office of Appeals applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the 2008 through 2010 tax years.

In the second quarter of 2018, a decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court resolving all disputes related to the transfer pricing issues for Guidant for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and our 2006 and 2007 tax years as well as the tax issues related to our 2006 transaction with Abbott Laboratories. Additionally, we resolved all issues with the IRS Office of Appeals for our 2008 through 2010 tax years, including the transfer pricing issue and other unrelated issues. The final settlement calculation included certain elections made in these relevant years and resulted in a final net tax payment of

$303 million

plus

$307 million

of estimated interest, which was remitted in the second quarter of 2018. Due to the final settlement of these disputes, we recorded a net tax benefit of

$250 million

in 2018.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we received a RAR from the IRS for our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The RAR reflected transfer pricing adjustments consistent with the basis of settlement for all transfer pricing issues agreed to in the Stipulation of Settled Issues. We remitted

$93 million

to the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting the net balance of tax and interest due for these years after consideration of amounts owed to us by the IRS. Due to the resolution of these tax years, we recorded a net tax benefit of

$90 million

.


We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. We had

$11 million

accrued for gross interest and penalties as of

December 31, 2018

and

$655 million

as of

December 31, 2017

. The decrease in gross interest and penalties of

$643 million

was recognized in our

consolidated statements of operations

and is primarily related to reaching settlements with the taxing authorities. We recognized net tax benefit related to interest and penalties of

$498 million

in


, as compared to a net tax expense of

$154 million

in


and

$46 million

in


. The decrease in our net tax expense related to interest and penalties as of

December 31, 2018

, as compared to

December 31, 2017

, is related to reaching settlements with the taxing authorities.

It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve transactional- related issues with foreign and state taxing authorities, in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to approximately

$11 million

.

There are a number of key provisions under the TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, that impact us. The final impact of the TCJA, as described below, differs from the estimates reported at December 31, 2017 due to, among other things, additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us, and actions that we may take as a result. The key changes from the TCJA that are reported as of

December 31, 2018

are the impact due to the reduced U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from

35.0 percent

to

21.0 percent

and a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings on which U.S. income tax is deferred. As a result of finalizing the impact of the TCJA, we recognized a tax benefit of

$67 million

in 2018. We recognized a total TCJA related tax expense of

$793 million

as of December 31, 2018 as compared to the provisional estimate of

$861 million

recognized as of December 31, 2017.

We are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the enacted tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. Therefore, any U.S. related deferred taxes were re-measured from

35.0 percent

down to

21.0 percent

based on the recorded balances. The analysis included an assessment on the deductibility of certain amounts for which deferred tax assets may have been recorded. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimate related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances, which was a benefit of approximately

$99 million

. In 2018, we finalized our calculations and did not adjust our estimate as recorded.

We are required to calculate a one-time transition tax based on our total post-1986 foreign subsidiaries' earnings and profits (E&P) that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. As a result of settling our various tax audits, the revised amount of transition tax is approximately

$856 million

as of

December 31, 2018

as compared to the preliminary amount recorded of approximately

$1.044 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

. We anticipate offsetting this liability against existing tax attributes reducing the required payment to approximately

$499 million

, which will be remitted over an eight-year period. We remitted the first estimated installment payment in the second quarter of 2018, with the balance remaining of

$429 million

as of

December 31, 2018

. In addition, we have provided for tax expense of

$18 million

on U.S. state income taxes on all U.S. dollar-denominated E&P accumulated through December 31, 2017, which constitutes the preponderance of our foreign subsidiaries' accumulated E&P through December 31, 2017. We intend to indefinitely reinvest any remaining foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 as well as current earnings in foreign operations for which income taxes have not already been provided at December 31, 2018. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings and additional outside basis difference in these entities is not practicable.

We are subject to a territorial tax system under the TCJA, in which we are required to provide for tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have established an accounting policy election to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense.

NOTE J – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. Over the years, there has been litigation initiated against us by others, including our competitors, claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. Intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. Although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.


During recent years, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters and have received favorable rulings in several other matters; however, there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.

In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted against us. Similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.

In addition, like other companies in the medical device industry, we are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. From time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.

In accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 450,

Contingencies

, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range.

Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was

$929 million

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$1.612 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

and includes certain estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. The decrease in our legal accrual was primarily due to settlement payments authorized in 2018 associated with product liability cases or claims related to transvaginal surgical mesh products. A portion of our legal accrual is funded and included in our restricted cash and restricted cash equivalent balances in

. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants.

In management's opinion, we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations and/or cash flows. Unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below, a range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding cannot be estimated.

Patent Litigation

On November 29, 2016 Nevro Corp. (Nevro) filed a patent infringement action against us and one of our subsidiaries, Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that six U.S. patents (Alataris) owned by Nevro are infringed by our spinal cord stimulation systems. On June 29, 2017, Nevro amended the complaint to add an additional patent (Fang). We deny the plaintiff's allegations and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. On July 24, 2018, summary judgment was entered in favor of the Company and on July 31, 2018, we received final judgment and dismissal of the action. On July 31, 2018, Nevro filed an appeal.

On December 9, 2016, the Company and Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation filed a patent infringement action against Nevro in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that ten U.S. patents owned by Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation are infringed by Nevro’s Senza™ Spinal Cord Stimulation System.

On March 10, 2017, Imran Niazi filed a patent infringement action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging that a U.S. patent owned by him is infringed by our Acuity™ Lead Delivery System. On June 30, 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue and on November 7, 2017 the Wisconsin Court granted the motion to dismiss. On November 13, 2017 Niazi refiled the same action in the U.S. District of Minnesota.


On November 20, 2017, The Board of Regents, University of Texas System (UT) and TissueGen. Inc., served a lawsuit against us in the Western District of Texas. The complaint against us alleges patent infringement of two U.S. patents owned by UT, relating to “Drug Releasing Biodegradable Fiber Implant” and “Drug Releasing Biodegradable Fiber for Delivery of Therapeutics,” and affects the manufacture, use and sale of our Synergy™ Stent System. On March 12, 2018, the court dismissed the action and transferred it to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. UT has appealed the decision.

On April 21, 2018, the Company and Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation filed a patent infringement, theft of trade secrets and tortious interference with a contract action against Nevro in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and amended the complaint on July 18, 2018, alleging that nine U.S. patents owned by Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation are infringed by Nevro’s Senza™ I and Senza™ II Spinal Cord Stimulation Systems.

Product Liability Litigation

No individual lawsuits remain pending in state court jurisdictions against Guidant alleging personal injuries associated with defibrillators or pacemakers involved in certain 2005 and 2006 product communications. Further, we are aware of approximately

six

Guidant product liability lawsuits pending in international jurisdictions associated with defibrillators or pacemakers, including devices involved in the 2005 and 2006 product communications.

Four

of these suits are pending in Canada involving certain models of Guidant pacemakers,

three

of which are stayed pending the outcome of

one

lead class action. On May 8, 2009, the Justice of Ontario Court certified a class of persons in whom pacemakers were implanted in Canada and a class of family members with derivative claims. In each case, these matters generally seek monetary damages from us. This class action has been inactive since 2011. On March 24, 2014, the Ontario Superior Court approved a

$3 million

settlement of a class action involving certain models of Guidant defibrillators. We believe Guidant has satisfied its obligations pursuant to the settlement agreement.

As of

February 5, 2019

, approximately

53,000

product liability cases or claims related to transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse have been asserted against us. The pending cases are in various federal and state courts in the U.S. and include

eight

putative class actions. There were also fewer than


cases in Canada, inclusive of

one

certified and

three

putative class actions and fewer than


claims in the United Kingdom. Generally, the plaintiffs allege personal injury associated with use of our transvaginal surgical mesh products. The plaintiffs assert design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. Over

3,100

of the cases have been specially assigned to one judge in state court in Massachusetts. On February 7, 2012, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (MDL) established MDL-2326 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia and transferred the federal court transvaginal surgical mesh cases to MDL-2326 for coordinated pretrial proceedings. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we received written discovery requests from certain state attorneys general offices regarding our transvaginal surgical mesh products. We have responded to those requests. As of

February 5, 2019

, we have entered into master settlement agreements in principle or are in the final stages of entering one with certain plaintiffs' counsel to resolve an aggregate of approximately

50,000

cases and claims. These master settlement agreements provide that the settlement and distribution of settlement funds to participating claimants are conditional upon, among other things, achieving minimum required claimant participation thresholds. Of the approximately

50,000

cases and claims, approximately

35,500

have met the conditions of the settlement and are final. All settlement agreements were entered into solely by way of compromise and without any admission or concession by us of any liability or wrongdoing.

On or about January 12, 2016, Teresa L. Stevens filed a claim against us and three other defendants asserting for herself and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated women, that she was harmed by a vaginal mesh implant that she alleges contained a counterfeit or adulterated resin product that we imported from China. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, before the same Court that is hearing the mesh MDL. The complaint, which alleges Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) violations, fraud, misrepresentation, deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment, seeks both equitable relief and damages under state and federal law. On January 26, 2016, the Court issued an order staying the case and directing the plaintiff to submit information to allow the FDA to issue a determination with respect to her allegations. In addition, we are in contact with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia and are responding voluntarily to their requests in connection with that office’s review of the allegations concerning the use of mesh resin in the complaint. We deny the plaintiff’s allegations and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.

On February 27, 2017, Carolyn Turner filed a complaint against us and five other defendants asserting for herself and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated women, that she was harmed by a vaginal mesh implant that she alleges contained a counterfeit or adulterated resin product that we imported from China. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division and alleges violations of the RICO, negligence, strict liability, breach of an express or implied warranty, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, fraud and unjust enrichment. Ms. Turner served this complaint against us on April 7, 2017. As of April 27, 2017, this case has been stayed, pending resolution of the transfer petition to the mesh multidistrict litigation. We deny the plaintiff’s allegations and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.


We have established a product liability accrual for known and estimated future cases and claims asserted against us as well as with respect to the actions that have resulted in verdicts against us and the costs of defense thereof associated with our transvaginal surgical mesh products. While we believe that our accrual associated with this matter is adequate, changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. While we continue to engage in discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel regarding potential resolution of pending cases and claims and intend to vigorously contest the cases and claims asserted against us, that do not settle, the final resolution of the cases and claims is uncertain and could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Initial trials involving our transvaginal surgical mesh products have resulted in both favorable and unfavorable judgments for us. We do not believe that the judgment in any one trial is representative of potential outcomes of all cases or claims related to our transvaginal surgical mesh products.

Governmental Investigations and Qui Tam Matters

On August 3, 2012, we were served with a qui tam complaint that had previously been filed under seal against Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on March 2, 2011. On August 8, 2012, we learned that the federal government had previously declined to intervene in this matter. The relators’ complaint, now unsealed, alleges that Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation violated the federal and various states' false claims acts through submission of fraudulent bills for implanted devices, under-reporting of certain adverse events and promotion of off-label uses. On September 10, 2012, the relators filed an amended complaint revising and restating certain of the claims in the original complaint. Our motion to dismiss, filed subsequently, was denied on May 31, 2013 and on June 28, 2013, we answered the amended complaint and brought certain counterclaims arising from relators’ unauthorized removal of documents from the business during their employments, which the relators moved to dismiss on July 22, 2013. The Court denied relators’ motion to dismiss the counterclaims on September 4, 2014. Following the completion of fact and expert discovery, we filed a motion for summary judgment against all claims on January 27, 2017, relators filed their own motion for summary judgment against our counterclaims that same date and the parties await the Court’s rulings on the motions. On December 15, 2017, the Court denied both motions for summary judgment. The case is set for trial beginning May 6, 2019.

On May 5, 2014, we were served with a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General. The subpoena seeks information relating to the launch of the Cognis™ and Teligen™ line of devices in 2008, the performance of those devices from 2007 to 2009 and the operation of the Physician Guided Learning Program. We are cooperating with this request. On May 6, 2016, a qui tam lawsuit in this matter was unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. At the same time, we learned that the U.S. government and the State of California had earlier declined to intervene in that lawsuit on April 15, 2016. The complaint was served on us on July 21, 2016. On October 7, 2016, the plaintiff/relator served an amended complaint that dropped the allegations relating to the Physician Guided Learning Program. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on December 7, 2016 and the court heard our motion to dismiss on April 5, 2017. On August 29, 2017, the Court granted the motion to dismiss, without prejudice and on September 19, 2017, the relator filed a Second Amended Complaint.

We filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on October 10, 2017 and the Court denied that motion on December 13, 2017. On July 31, 2018, relator filed a motion seeking leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. The Court denied the motion on October 30, 2018.

On February 23, 2015, a judge for the Court of Modena (Italy) ordered a trial for Boston Scientific SpA and three of its employees, as well as numerous other defendants charged in criminal proceedings. The charges arise from allegations that the defendants made improper donations to certain health care providers and other employees of the Hospital of Modena in order to induce them to conduct unauthorized clinical trials, as well as related government fraud in relation to the financing of such clinical trials. A trial began on February 24, 2016 and is ongoing. On November 10, 2017, the Court issued a ruling that convicted one Boston Scientific employee but acquitted two others, and levied a fine of

€245 thousand

against us and imposed joint and several civil damages of

€620 thousand

on all defendants. We continue to deny these allegations, timely appealed the decision on May 10, 2018 and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously.

On December 1, 2015, the Brazilian governmental entity known as CADE (the Administrative Council of Economic Defense), served a search warrant on the offices of our Brazilian subsidiary, as well as on the Brazilian offices of several other major medical device makers who do business in Brazil, in furtherance of an investigation into alleged anti-competitive activity with respect to certain tender offers for government contracts. On June 20, 2017, CADE, through the publication of a “technical note,” announced that it was launching a formal administrative proceeding against Boston Scientific’s Brazilian subsidiary, Boston Scientific do Brasil Ltda., as well as against the Brazilian operations of Medtronic, Biotronik and St. Jude Medical, two Brazilian associations, ABIMED and AMBIMO and 29 individuals for alleged anti-competitive behavior. We deny the allegations and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.


On December 14, 2016, we learned that the Associacao Brasileira de Medicina de Grupo d/b/a ABRAMGE filed a complaint against us, Arthrex and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. This complaint, which ABRAMGE never served against us, alleges that the defendants or their agents paid kickbacks to health care providers in order to increase sales and prices and are liable under a variety of common law theories. On February 6, 2017, ABRAMGE filed and served an amended complaint on us and the other defendants. The amended complaint does not contain any material changes in the allegations against us. Subsequently, on March 2, 2017, ABRAMGE filed a motion to consolidate this lawsuit with two other similar suits that it had brought against Stryker and Abbott Laboratories, in a multidistrict litigation proceeding. On April 13, 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, as well as a separate opposition to the multidistrict litigation motion and on May 31, 2017, the Joint Panel on Multi-District Litigation denied ABRAMGE’s motion for the multidistrict litigation. On September 1, 2017, ABRAMGE filed a motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, while our motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint remained pending. On September 15, 2017, we filed an opposition to the motion seeking leave to amend. Both our motion to dismiss and the motion seeking leave to amend remain pending. On November 8, 2018, the Court granted ABRAMGE’s motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, while also granting us leave to renew our motion to dismiss. We filed our motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on January 18, 2019.

Other Proceedings

On May 16, 2018, Arthur Rosenthal et al., filed a plenary summons against Boston Scientific Corporation and Boston Scientific Limited with the High Court of Ireland alleging that payments are due pursuant a transaction agreement regarding Labcoat Limited.

On September 12, 2018, Channel Medsystems, Inc. (Channel) filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court against us for alleged breach of a

$275 million

purchase agreement.

Channel alleges that we breached the agreement by terminating it. We have answered the complaint, denied the claims by Channel and have counterclaimed to recover part of our investment in Channel, alleging fraud in the inducement. The court has set a trial date of April 15, 2019.

Matters Concluded Since December 31, 2017

On October 28, 2016, the Regents of the University of California filed a patent infringement action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that two U.S. patents (Lesh) owned by the Regents of the University of California are infringed by certain of our catheters and other devices used to treat atrial fibrillation. The Company and the Regents settled the matter, and the case was dismissed on June 20, 2018.

On May 19, 2005, G. David Jang, M.D. filed suit against us alleging breach of contract relating to certain patent rights covering stent technology. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California seeking monetary damages and rescission of contract. After a Markman ruling relating to the Jang patent rights, Dr. Jang stipulated to the dismissal of certain claims alleged in the complaint with a right to appeal and the parties subsequently agreed to settle the other claims. In May 2007, Dr. Jang filed an appeal with respect to the remaining patent claims and in July 2008, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's consent judgment and remanded the case back to the District Court for further clarification. In August 2011, the District Court entered a stipulated judgment that we did not infringe the Jang patent. Dr. Jang filed an appeal on September 21, 2011 and on August 22, 2012, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. On July 8, 2015, a jury found that our Express™ Stent family did not literally infringe a Jang patent, but that the stents infringed under the doctrine of equivalents. The court reserved judgment until the conclusion of further proceedings related to the doctrine of equivalents finding. On September 29, 2015, the court ruled that our Express Stent family did not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents and, on October 30, 2015, the court entered judgment in our favor. On November 25, 2015, Dr. Jang filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law on literal infringement and/or for a new trial. On February 3, 2016, the court denied Dr. Jang’s motion for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law. Dr. Jang filed a notice of appeal. On September 29, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment that our Express Stent did not infringe the Jang patents and we did not owe Dr. Jang any payments. On October 30, 2017, Jang filed a petition for rehearing and on December 21, 2017 the rehearing was denied. On March 21, 2018, Jang filed a petition for United States Supreme Court review and, on October 1, 2018, the Supreme Court denied his petition.


On January 15, 2019, we announced that we reached an agreement with Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (Edwards) to settle all outstanding patent disputes between us and Edwards in all venues around the world. All pending cases or appeals in courts and patent offices between the two companies will be dismissed, and the parties will not litigate patent disputes related to current portfolios of transcatheter aortic valves, certain mitral valve repair devices, and left atrial appendage closure devices. Any injunctions currently in place will be lifted. Under the terms of the agreement, Edwards made a one-time payment to us of

$180 million

. No further royalties will be owed by either party under the agreement. All other terms remain confidential. The previously disclosed matters that have been resolved as a result of this settlement include:

NOTE L – STOCK INCENTIVE AND OWNERSHIP PLANS

Employee and Director Stock Incentive Plans

In 2011, our Board of Directors and stockholders approved our 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2011 LTIP), authorizing for issuance up to

146 million

shares of our common stock. The 2011 LTIP covers officers, directors, employees and consultants and provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted common stock, deferred stock units (DSU), options to acquire our common stock, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (market-based and performance-based DSUs) and other stock and non-stock awards. Shares reserved under our current and former stock incentive plans totaled approximately

132 million

as of

December 31, 2018

. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors, consisting of independent, non-employee directors may authorize the issuance of common stock and cash awards under the 2011 LTIP in recognition of the achievement of long-term performance objectives established by the Committee.


Non-qualified options issued to employees are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock on the grant date, vest over a

four

-year service period and have a

ten

-year contractual life. In the case of qualified options, if the recipient owns more than

ten percent

of the voting power of all classes of stock, the option granted will be at an exercise price of

110 percent

of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and will expire over a period not to exceed

five

years. Non-vested stock awards, including restricted stock awards and DSUs, issued to employees are generally granted with an exercise price of

zero

and typically vest in five equal annual installments. These awards represent our commitment to issue shares to recipients after the vesting period. Upon each vesting date, such awards are no longer subject to risk of forfeiture and we issue shares of our common stock to the recipient.

The following presents the impact of stock-based compensation on our

consolidated statements of operations

:

Stock Options

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock options granted to employees under our stock incentive plans. We calculated the fair value for options granted using the following estimated weighted-average assumptions:

Expected Volatility

We use our historical volatility and implied volatility as a basis to estimate expected volatility in our valuation of stock options.

Expected Term

We estimate the expected term of options using historical exercise and forfeiture data. We believe that this historical data provides the best estimate of the expected term of new option grants.

Risk-Free Interest Rate

We use yield rates on U.S. Treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk-free interest rate in our grant-date fair value assessment.


Expected Dividend Yield

We have not historically paid cash dividends to our stockholders and currently do not intend to pay cash dividends. Therefore, we have assumed an expected dividend yield of zero in our grant-date fair value assessment.

Information related to stock options under stock incentive plans are as follows:

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was

$90 million

in


and

$64 million

in both


and


.


Non-Vested Stock

We value restricted stock awards and DSUs based on the closing trading value of our shares on the date of grant. Information related to non-vested stock awards is as follows:

(1)

The number of restricted stock units vested includes shares withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements.

The total vesting date fair value of stock award units that vested was approximately

$170 million

in


,

$190 million

in


and

$179 million

in


.

Market-based DSU Awards

During


,


and


, we granted market-based DSU awards to certain members of our senior management team. The number of shares ultimately issued to the recipient is based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of our common stock as compared to the TSR of the common stock of the other companies in the S&P 500 Health Care Index over a three-year performance period. The number of DSUs ultimately granted under this program range from

0 percent

to

200 percent

of the target number of performance-based DSUs awarded to the participant as determined by achievement of the performance criteria of the program. In addition, award recipients must remain employed by us throughout the three-year performance period to attain the full amount of the market-based DSUs that satisfied the market performance criteria.

We determined the fair value of the market-based DSU awards to be approximately

$7 million

for


,

$8 million

for


and

$6 million

for


. We determined these fair values based on Monte Carlo simulations as of the date of grant, utilizing the following assumptions:

We recognize the expense on these awards in our

consolidated statements of operations

on a straight-line basis over the three-year measurement period.


Free Cash Flow Performance-based DSU Awards

During


,


and


, we granted free cash flow performance-based DSU awards to certain members of our senior management team. The attainment of these performance-based DSUs is based on our adjusted free cash flow (AFCF) measured against our internal annual financial plan performance for AFCF. AFCF is measured over a one-year performance period beginning January 1st

of each year and ending December 31st. The number of DSUs ultimately granted under this program range from

0 percent

to

150 percent

of the target number of performance-based DSUs awarded to the participant as determined by achievement of the performance criteria of the program. In addition, award recipients must remain employed by us throughout a three-year service period (inclusive of the one-year performance period) to attain the full amount of the performance-based DSUs that satisfied the performance criteria.

The following table presents our assumptions used in determining the fair value of our AFCF awards currently expected to vest as of December 31, 2018:

We recognize the expense on these awards in our

consolidated statements of operations

over the vesting period which is three years after the date of grant.

Expense Attribution

We recognize compensation expense for our stock incentive plan using a straight-line method over the substantive vesting period. Most of our stock awards provide for immediate vesting upon death or disability of the participant. In addition, our stock grants to employees provide for accelerated vesting of our stock-based awards, other than performance-based and market-based awards, upon retirement. In accordance with the terms of our stock grants, for employees who will become retirement eligible prior to the vest date we expense stock-based awards, other than performance-based and market-based awards, over the greater of one year or the period between grant date and retirement-eligibility. The performance-based and market-based awards discussed above do not contain provisions that would accelerate the full vesting of the awards upon retirement-eligibility.

We recognize stock-based compensation expense for the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.

FASB ASC Topic 718,

Compensation – Stock Compensation

allows forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock-based award. We have applied, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, a weighted-average annual forfeiture rate of approximately

six percent

to all unvested stock-based awards as of

December 31, 2018

, which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period. We re-evaluate this analysis annually or more frequently if there are significant changes in circumstances and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary. Ultimately, we will only recognize expense for those shares that vest.

Unrecognized Compensation Cost

We expect to recognize the following future expense for awards outstanding as of

December 31, 2018

:

(1)

Amounts presented represent compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures.


Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Our global employee stock purchase plan provides for the granting of options to purchase up to

50 million

shares of our common stock to all eligible employees. Under the global employee stock purchase plan, we grant each eligible employee, at the beginning of each six-month offering period, an option to purchase shares of our common stock equal to not more than

ten percent

of the employee’s eligible compensation or the statutory limit under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Such options may be exercised only to the extent of accumulated payroll deductions at the end of the offering period, at a purchase price equal to

85 percent

of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever is less. As of

December 31, 2018

, there were approximately

10 million

shares available for future issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.

Information related to shares issued or to be issued in connection with the employee stock purchase plan based on employee contributions and the range of purchase prices is as follows:

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan. We recognize expense related to shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan ratably over the offering period.

NOTE M – WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING

The impact of stock options outstanding with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value of our common stock was immaterial for all periods presented.

NOTE N – SEGMENT REPORTING

We have

three

reportable segments comprised of MedSurg, Rhythm and Neuro, and Cardiovascular, which represent an aggregation of our operating segments.

Each of our reportable segments generates revenues from the sale of medical devices.

We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment net sales and operating income, excluding intersegment profits. In 2017, we updated our presentation of segment net sales and operating income to include the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, since our chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews operating results both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and the following presentation more closely aligns to our

consolidated financial statements

. We exclude from segment operating income certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments that our CODM considers to be non-operational, such as amounts related to amortization expense, intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items and litigation-related items. Although we exclude these amounts from segment operating income, they are included in reported

Income (loss) before income taxes

on the

consolidated statements of operations

and are included in the reconciliation below.

Effective January 1, 2018, following organizational changes to align the structure of our business with our focus on active implantable devices, we revised our reportable segments, in accordance with

FASB ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

.

The revision reflects a reclassification of our Neuromodulation business from our

MedSurg

segment to our newly created Rhythm and Neuro segment. We have revised prior year amounts to conform to the current year’s presentation (as denoted with an asterisk (*) throughout). There was no revision to operating segments or reporting units as a result of the organizational change.


A reconciliation of the totals reported for the reportable segments to the applicable line items in our accompanying

consolidated statements of operations

is as follows (in millions, except percentages):



NOTE O – REVENUE

We generate revenue primarily from the sale of single-use medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our

consolidated statements of operations

. The following tables disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by business and geographic region (in millions):


(1)

Emerging Markets is defined as certain countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors and our global capabilities. Currently, we include 20 countries in our definition of Emerging Markets.

Contract liabilities are classified within

Other current liabilities

and

Other long-term liabilities

on our accompanying

consolidated balance sheets

. Our deferred revenue balance was

$373 million

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$411 million

as of January 1, 2018. Our contractual liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE Patient Management System. Revenue is recognized over the average service period which is based on device and patient longevity. We recognized revenue of

$117 million

in 2018 that was included in the above January 1, 2018 contract liability balance. We have elected not to disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less. In addition, we have not identified material unfulfilled performance obligations for which revenue is not currently deferred. Refer to

Note A – Significant Accounting Policies

for additional information on our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition.

NOTE P – CHANGES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

The following table provides the reclassifications out of

Other comprehensive income, net of tax

:


Refer to

Note D – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements

for further detail on the reclassifications related to derivatives.

We adopted Update No. 2016-01 in the first quarter of 2018, and as a result of adopting the standard, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities previously recorded to

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax

.

The gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items before reclassifications and gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items reclassified from

were reduced by immaterial income tax impacts in


and in


.

NOTE Q – NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Periodically, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies. Recently issued standards typically do not require adoption until a future effective date. Prior to their effective date, we evaluate the pronouncements to determine the potential effects of adoption on our

consolidated financial statements

.

Standards to be Implemented

ASC Update No. 2016-02

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-02,

Leases

(Topic 842). The purpose of Update No. 2016-02 is to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, including those previously classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP, and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842, as amended, is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.

We currently plan to adopt the standard using the transition method provided by ASC Update No. 2018-11,

Leases

(Topic 842): Targeted Improvements

. Under this method, we will initially apply the new leasing rules on January 1, 2019, rather than at the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Prior periods presented will be in accordance with the existing lease guidance.

Upon transition, we plan to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under Topic 842 transition guidance to our entire lease portfolio at January 1, 2019. As a result, we are not required to reassess (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the classification of any expired or existing leases, and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. Furthermore, we will be electing not to separate lease and non-lease components for the majority of our leases. Instead, for these applicable classes of underlying assets, we will account for each separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with that lease component, as a single lease component.

As a result of adopting Topic 842, we expect to recognize additional right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities for our existing lease portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets of approximately

$300 million

, with no material impact to our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows. For the first quarter of 2019, we will provide additional disclosures in the notes to our

consolidated statements of operations

regarding our leasing portfolio, including key judgements and assumptions and the discount rate used in calculating our right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities. Please refer to

Note F - Leases and Other Purchase Obligations

for information regarding our lease portfolio as of December 31, 2018 as accounted for under ASC Topic 840,

Leases

.

To ensure we meet the reporting and disclosure requirements of Topic 842, we implemented in 2018 a new lease administration and lease accounting system that will track all our material leasing arrangements. In addition, in the first quarter of 2019, we designed new internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the transition adjustment and financial reporting under Topic 842. We also established monitoring controls to ensure we have appropriate mechanisms in place to identify material leases timely, particularly contracts that may contain embedded lease features.

ASC Update No. 2016-13

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-13,

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses

(Topic 326)

: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

. The purpose of Update No. 2016-13 is to replace the current incurred loss impairment methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information, including forecasted information, to develop credit loss estimates. Update No. 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods


within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are in the process of determining the effect that the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations.

ASC Update No. 2018-15

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2018-15,

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)

:

Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract

. The purpose of Update No. 2018-15 is to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). Update No. 2018-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. We are in the process of determining the effect that the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations.

No other new accounting pronouncements, issued or effective, during the period had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our

consolidated financial statements

.

NOTE R - EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

Following our 2006 acquisition of Guidant, we sponsored the Guidant Supplemental Retirement Plan, a frozen, non-qualified defined benefit plan for certain former officers and employees of Guidant. The Guidant Supplemental Retirement Plan was partially funded through a Rabbi Trust that contains segregated company assets within restricted cash used to pay the benefit obligations related to the plan.

We also maintain an Executive Retirement Plan, a defined benefit plan covering executive officers and division presidents. Participants may retire with unreduced benefits once retirement conditions have been satisfied. In addition, we maintain retirement plans covering certain international employees.

We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans and record the underfunded portion as a liability within non-current liabilities, with the current portion within accrued expenses, on the

consolidated balance sheets

, recognizing changes in the funded status through

OCI

. The outstanding obligation is as follows:


A rollforward of the changes in the PBO for our funded retirement plans is as follows:

The critical assumptions associated with our employee retirement plans as of

December 31, 2017

are as follows:

We base our discount rate on the rates of return available on high-quality bonds with maturities approximating the expected period over which benefits will be paid. The rate of compensation increase is based on historical and expected rate increases. We base our rate of expected return on plan assets on historical experience, our investment guidelines and expectations for long-term rates of return. Our international pension plan assets are invested in a variety of securities, primarily equity securities and government bonds. These securities are considered Level 1 and Level 2 investments.

A rollforward of the changes in the fair value of plan assets for our funded retirement plans is as follows:

(1)

Plans obtained through acquisition and other increases in connection with our international operations.

We also sponsor a voluntary 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for eligible employees. We match 200 percent of employee elective deferrals for the first two percent of employee eligible compensation and 50 percent of employee elective deferrals greater than


two percent, but not exceeding six percent, of employee eligible compensation. Total expense for our matching contributions to the plan was
