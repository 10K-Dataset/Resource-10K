PART
          I

ITEM
          1. BUSINESS

The
          Company

Boston
          Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer
          of
          medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical
          specialties including interventional cardiology, cardiac rhythm management,
          peripheral interventions, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, electrophysiology,
          neurovascular intervention, oncology, endoscopy, urology, gynecology and
          neuromodulation. When used in this report, the terms

“

we,

”

“us,”
“our”
and
          the “Company” mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and
          subsidiaries.

Since
          we
          were formed in 1979, we have advanced the practice of less-invasive medicine
          by
          helping physicians and other medical professionals treat a variety of diseases
          and improve patients

’

quality
          of life
          by providing alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that
          are
          typically traumatic to the body. Some of our medical products are used
          for
          enlarging narrowed blood vessels to prevent heart attack and stroke; clearing
          passages blocked by plaque to restore blood flow; detecting and managing
          fast,
          slow or irregular heart rhythms; mapping electrical problems in the heart;
          opening obstructions and bringing relief to patients suffering from various
          forms of cancer; performing biopsies and intravascular ultrasounds; placing
          filters to prevent blood clots from reaching the lungs, heart or brain;
          treating
          urological, gynecological, renal, pulmonary, neurovascular and gastrointestinal
          diseases; and modulating nerve activity to treat deafness and chronic pain.

Our
          history began in the late 1960s when our co-founder, John Abele, acquired
          an
          equity interest in Medi-tech, Inc., a research and development company
          focused on developing alternatives to surgery. Medi-tech’s initial products, a
          family of steerable catheters, were introduced in 1969 and were used in
          some of the first less-invasive procedures performed. In 1979, John Abele
          joined
          with Pete Nicholas to form Boston Scientific Corporation, which indirectly
          acquired Medi-tech. This acquisition began a period of active and focused
          marketing, new product development and organizational growth. Since then,
          our
          net sales have increased substantially, growing from $1.8 million in 1979
          to approximately $7.8 billion in 2006.

Our
          growth has been fueled in part by strategic acquisitions and alliances
          designed
          to improve our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in the
          medical
          device industry. In 2006, we experienced a transforming event with our
          acquisition of Guidant Corporation,

a
          world
          leader in the treatment of cardiac disease. This acquisition enabled us
          to
          become a major provider in the more than $9 billion global Cardiac Rhythm
          Management (CRM) business,  enhancing our overall competitive position
          and long-term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio.
          With this acquisition, we have become one of the world’s largest cardiovascular
          device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapies.

This
          and
          other acquisitions have helped us add promising new technologies to our
          pipeline
          and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios in the world for use
          in
          less-invasive procedures. We believe that the depth and breadth of our
          product
          portfolio has also enabled us to compete more effectively in, and better
          absorb
          the pressures of, the current healthcare environment of cost containment,
          managed care, large buying groups and hospital consolidation.

Information
          on revenues, profits and total assets for our business segments and by
          geographical area appears in our consolidated financial statements for
          the year
          ended December 31, 2006, which are included in Item 8 of this report.

The
          Drug-Eluting Stent Opportunity

Our
          broad, innovative product offerings have enabled us to become a leader
          in the
          interventional cardiology market. This leadership is in large part due
          to our
          coronary stent product offerings. Coronary stents are tiny, mesh tubes
          used in
          the treatment of coronary artery disease and implanted in patients to prop
          open
          arteries and facilitate blood flow from the heart. We have further enhanced
          the
          outcomes associated with the use of coronary stents, particularly the processes
          that lead to restenosis (the growth of neointimal tissue within an artery
          after
          angioplasty and stenting), through dedicated internal and external product
          development and scientific research of drug-eluting stent systems.

Use
          of
          our products in the United States and abroad has demonstrated that drug-eluting
          stents reduce the need for repeat procedures—or more expensive surgical
          procedures—and reduce healthcare costs, as well as overall patient risk, trauma,
          procedure time and the need for aftercare. Since its U.S. launch in
          March 2004 and its launch in our Europe and
          Inter-Continental markets in 2003, our proprietary polymer-based
          paclitaxel-eluting stent technology for reducing coronary restenosis, the
          TAXUS®
Express


™
          paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system, has become the worldwide leader
          in the
          drug-eluting coronary stent market. In 2006, approximately 30 percent of
          our net sales were derived from sales of our TAXUS stent system.

We
          are
          continuing to enhance our product offerings in the coronary drug-eluting
          stent
          market. We recently launched our next-generation coronary stent, the TAXUS®
Liberté™ paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system, in our Europe and
          Inter-Continental markets, and we expect to launch the product in the U.S.,
          subject to regulatory approval. The Liberté™ coronary stent is designed to
          further enhance deliverability and conformability, particularly in challenging
          lesions. Also, prior to our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott Laboratories
          acquired
          Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and shares
          the drug-eluting technology it acquired from Guidant with us. This arrangement
          gives us access to a second drug-eluting stent program which complements
          our
          existing TAXUS coronary stent program. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we
          launched our PROMUS™ everolimus-eluting stent system in certain European
          countries and expect to launch the PROMUS stent system in certain other
          European
          markets in the first quarter of 2007, certain Inter-Continental markets
          in the
          second quarter of 2007 and in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory approval.

Our
          U.S.
          TAXUS stent system sales decreased in 2006 relative to 2005, due in part
          to a
          decline in the U.S. market size due to recent uncertainty regarding the
          risk of
          late stent thrombosis following the use of drug-eluting stents. Late stent
          thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented
          area one
          year or more after implantation of the stent. In the fourth quarter of
          2006, the
          FDA held a special advisory panel meeting to discuss drug-eluting stents.
          Members of the panel concluded that drug-eluting stents remain safe and
          effective when used as indicated, and that the benefits outweigh the
          risks.

The
            Cardiac Rhythm Management Opportunity

As
          a
          result of our acquisition of Guidant in April 2006, we now develop, manufacture
          and market products that focus on the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias
          and heart
          failure. Natural electrical impulses stimulate the heart’s chambers to pump
          blood. In healthy individuals, the electrical current causes the heart
          to beat
          at an appropriate rate and in synchrony. We make a variety of implantable
          devices that can monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac
          abnormalities, including:

·

Implantable
                    defibrillator systems used to detect and treat abnormally fast
                    heart
                    rhythms (tachycardia) that could result in sudden cardiac death,
                    including
                    implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator systems
                    used
                    to treat heart failure; and

·

Implantable
                    pacemaker systems used to manage slow or irregular heart rhythms
                    (bradycardia), including implantable cardiac resynchronization
                    therapy
                    pacemaker systems used to treat heart
                    failure.

Tachycardia
          (abnormally fast or chaotic heart rhythms) can prevent the heart from pumping
          blood efficiently and can lead to sudden cardiac death. Implantable cardioverter
          defibrillator systems (defibrillators, leads, programmers, our LATITUDE® Patient
          Management System and accessories) monitor the heart and can deliver electrical
          energy, restoring a normal rhythm. Our defibrillators can deliver tiered
          therapy—a staged progression from lower intensity pacing pulses designed to
          correct the abnormal rhythm to more aggressive shocks to restore a
          heartbeat.

Heart
          failure (the heart’s inability to pump effectively) is a debilitating,
          progressive condition, with symptoms including shortness of breath and
          extreme
          fatigue. After a person is diagnosed with heart failure, the one-year mortality
          rate is high, with one in five people dying. Moreover, once diagnosed,
          sudden
          cardiac death occurs at six to nine times the rate of the general population.
          The condition is pervasive, with approximately five million people in the
          U.S.
          affected.

Bradycardia
          (slow or irregular heart rhythms) often results in a heart rate
          insufficient to provide adequate blood flow throughout the body, creating
          symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness and fainting. Cardiac pacemaker systems
          (pulse generators, leads, programmers and accessories) deliver electrical
          energy
          to stimulate the heart to beat more frequently and regularly. Pacemakers
          range
          from conventional single-chamber devices to more sophisticated adaptive-rate,
          dual-chamber devices.

Our
          remote monitoring system, the LATITUDE® Patient Management System, can be placed
          in a patient’s home (at their bedside) and reads implantable device information
          at times specified by the patient’s physician. The communicator can then
          transmit the data to a secure Internet server where the physician (or other
          third party) can access this medical information anytime, anywhere. In
          addition
          to automatic device data uploads, the communicator enables a daily
          confirmation of the patient’s device status, providing assurance the device is
          operating properly. Available as an optional component to the system is
          the
          LATITUDE Weight Scale and Blood Pressure Monitor. Weight and blood pressure
          data
          is captured by the communicator and sent to the secure server for review
          by the
          patient’s physician (or other technician). In addition, this weight and blood
          information is immediately available to patients in their home to assist
          their
          compliance with the day-to-day and home-based heart failure instructions
          prescribed by their physician.

Business
          Strategy

Our
          mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity
          of
          healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less-invasive
          medical devices and procedures. We believe that the pursuit of this mission
          will
          likewise enhance shareholder value.


[Table
              of Contents]

We
          intend
          to accomplish our mission through the continuing refinement of existing
          products and procedures and the investigation and development of new
          technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the
          need for
          aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products
          and
          technologies with those we obtained externally through strategic acquisitions
          and alliances. Building relationships with development-stage companies
          and
          inventors allows us to deepen our current franchises as well as expand
          into
          complementary businesses.

Key
          elements of our overall business strategy include the following:

Product
          Quality

Our
          commitment to quality and the success of our quality objectives are designed
          to
          build customer trust and loyalty. This commitment to provide quality products
          to
          our customers runs throughout our organization and is one of our most critical
          business objectives. During 2005, in order to strengthen our quality controls,
          we established Project Horizon, a cross-functional initiative to further
          improve
          and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems. Under
          Project Horizon, we have made an overarching effort to elevate quality
          thinking in all that we do. To that end, in 2006, we have made significant
          improvements to our quality systems, including in the areas of field action
          decision-making, corrective and preventative actions, management controls,
          process validations and complaint management systems. In 2006, our Board of
          Directors created a Compliance and Quality Committee to monitor our compliance
          and quality initiatives. Our quality policy, applicable to all employees,
          is “I
          improve the quality of patient care and all things Boston
          Scientific.”

Innovation

We
          are
          committed to harnessing technological innovation through a mixture of tactical
          and strategic initiatives that are designed to offer sustainable growth
          in the
          near and long term. Combining internally developed products and technologies
          with those obtained through acquisitions and alliances allows us to focus
          on and
          deliver products currently in our own research and development pipeline
          as well
          as to strengthen our technology portfolio by accessing third-party technologies.

Clinical
          Excellence

Our
          commitment to innovation is further demonstrated by our clinical capabilities.
          Our clinical groups focus on driving innovative therapies that can transform
          the
          practice of medicine. Our clinical teams are organized by therapeutic specialty
          to better support our

research
          and development pipeline and marketing and sales efforts.

During
          2006, our clinical organizations planned, initiated and conducted an expanding
          series of focused clinical trials that support regulatory and reimbursement
          requirements and demonstrate the safe and effective clinical performance
          of
          critical products and technologies. In October, we announced positive results
          from our TAXUS OLYMPIA registry, supporting the safety and efficacy of
          our TAXUS
          Liberté stent system in real-world patient subsets considered high risk for
          bare-metal stenting, including diabetics, small vessels and long lesions.
          We are
          currently enrolling patients in our SYNTAX clinical trial, which will
          compare the performance of drug-eluting stents with cardiac surgery in the
          most complex subsets: those with coronary artery disease in all three
          coronary arteries, in the left main coronary artery, or both.

Product
          Diversity

We
          offer
          products in numerous product categories, which are used by physicians throughout
          the world in a broad range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The


[Table
              of Contents]

breadth
          and diversity of our product lines permit medical specialists and purchasing
          organizations to satisfy many of their less-invasive medical device requirements
          from a single source.

Operational
          Excellence

We
          are
          focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening
          our manufacturing processes and optimizing our plant network in order to
          increase operational efficiencies within our organization. By shifting
          global
          manufacturing along product lines, we are able to leverage our existing
          resources and concentrate on new product development, including the enhancement
          of existing products and their commercial launch. We are committing additional
          resources to support our growth and implementing new systems designed to
          provide
          improved quality and reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower
          supply
          chain costs. We have substantially increased our focus on process controls
          and
          validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our
          operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous
          improvement in product quality. In 2007, we are also focused on examining
          our
          operations and general business activities to identify cost-improvement
          opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness.

Focused
          Marketing

We
          consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers.
          Each of our business groups maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing
          teams
          focusing on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of
          different medical conditions. We believe that this focused disease state
          management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales
          representatives and to foster close professional relationships with physicians.
          In recent years, we have expanded our direct sales presence worldwide so
          as to
          be in a position to take advantage of expanding market opportunities.

Active
          Participation in the Medical Community

We
          believe that we have excellent working relationships with physicians and
          others
          in the medical industry, which enable us to gain a detailed understanding
          of new
          therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing
          needs of physicians and patients. Active participation in the medical community
          contributes to physician understanding and adoption of less-invasive techniques
          and the expansion of these techniques into new therapeutic and diagnostic
          areas.

Corporate
          Culture

We
          believe that success and leadership evolve from a motivating corporate
          culture
          that rewards achievement, respects and values individual employees and
          customers, and focuses on quality, patient care, integrity, technology
          and
          service. This high performance culture has embraced an intense increase
          in
          quality focus, and now places quality at the top of its priorities. We
          believe
          that our success is attributable in large part to the high caliber of our
          employees and our commitment to respecting the values on which our success
          has
          been based.

Research
          and Development

Our
          investment in research and development is critical to drive our future
          growth.
          We have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and
          innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter new
          markets.
          Enhancements to existing products that are typically originated and developed
          within our research and development, manufacturing and marketing operations
          contribute to each

year’s
          sales growth. We believe that streamlining,


[Table
              of Contents]

prioritizing
          and coordinating our technology pipeline and new product development activities
          are essential to our ability to stimulate growth and maintain leadership
          positions in our markets. Our approach to new product design and development
          is
          through focused, cross-functional teams. We believe that our formal process
          for
          technology and product development aids in our ability to offer innovative
          and
          manufacturable products in a consistent and timely manner. Involvement
          of the
          research and development, clinical, quality, regulatory, manufacturing
          and
          marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product
          development cycle. This collaboration allows these teams to concentrate
          resources on the most viable and game-changing new products and technologies
          and
          get them to market in a timely manner. In addition to internal development,
          we
          work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians
          around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products.

We
          believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development
          efforts. In 2006, we expended over $1.0 billion on research and development,
          representing approximately 13 percent of our 2006 net sales. Our investment
          in research and development reflects:

·

spending
                    on new product development programs;

·

regulatory
                    compliance and clinical research, particularly relating to our
                    next-generation stent and CRM platforms and other development
                    programs
                    acquired in connection with our business combinations;
                    and

·

sustaining
                    engineering efforts which factor customer (or “post market”) feedback into
                    continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed products.

Strategic
          Initiatives

Since
          1995, we have undertaken a strategic acquisition program to assemble the
          lines
          of business necessary to achieve the critical mass that allows us to continue
          to
          be a leader in the medical device industry. In 2006, in addition to our
          acquisition of Guidant, we invested approximately $500

million
          in approximately 25 new and existing strategic alliances and acquisitions.
          These
          initiatives are intended to further expand our product offerings by adding
          new
          or complementary technologies to our already diverse technology portfolio.

Many
          of
          our alliances involve complex arrangements with third parties and include,
          in
          many instances, the option to purchase these companies at pre-established
          future
          dates, generally upon the attainment of performance, regulatory and/or
          revenue
          milestones. These arrangements allow us to evaluate new technologies prior
          to
          acquiring them.

We
          expect
          that we will continue to focus selectively on strategic acquisitions and
          alliances in order to provide new products and technology platforms to
          our
          customers, including making additional investments in several of our existing
          strategic relationships.

          procedures. Our Neuromodulation organization currently focuses on the treatment
          of auditory disorders and chronic pain. During 2006, approximately
          80 percent of our net sales were derived from our Cardiovascular business
          groups, approximately 17 percent from our Endosurgery business groups and
          approximately 3 percent from our Neuromodulation business group.

The
          following section describes some of our Cardiovascular, Endosurgery and
          Neuromodulation offerings:

Cardiovascular

Coronary
          Stent Business

          a broad line of products used to treat patients with atherosclerosis.
          Atherosclerosis, a principal cause of coronary artery obstructive disease,
          is
          characterized by a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries and
          a
          narrowing of arterial lumens (openings) caused by the progressive development
          of
          deposits of plaque. The majority of our products in this market are used
          in
          percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and include bare-metal

          the
          treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), we currently market
          electro-surgical resection devices designed to resect large diseased tissue
          sites. We also market disposable needle biopsy devices, designed to take
          core
          prostate biopsy samples. In addition, we distribute and market the Prolieve
          thermodilatation system, a transurethral microwave thermotherapy system,
          and the
          DuoTome™ SideLite™ holmium laser treatment system for treatment of symptoms
          associated with BPH.

Pelvic
          Floor Reconstruction and Urinary Incontinence

We
          market
          a line of less-invasive devices to treat female pelvic floor
          conditions in the area of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ
          prolapse. These devices include a full line of mid-urethral sling
          products, sling materials, graft materials, suturing devices and
          injectables. In May 2006, we were granted exclusive U.S. distribution rights
          to
          the Coaptite® Injectable Implant, a next-generation bulking agent, for the
          treatment of stress urinary incontinence.

Gynecology

We
          also
          market other products in the area of women’s health. Our Hydro
          ThermAblator® System (HTA® system) offers a less-invasive technology for the
          treatment of excessive uterine bleeding by ablating the lining of the uterus,
          the tissue responsible for menstrual bleeding.

Oncology

We
          market
          a broad line of products designed to treat, diagnose and palliate various
          forms
          of benign and malignant tumors. Our current suite of products includes
          microcatheters, embolic agents and coils designed to restrict blood supply
          to
          targeted sites. In addition, we market radiofrequency-based therapeutic
          devices
          for the ablation of various forms of soft tissue lesions (tumors). Also
          included
          in the oncology portfolio is a complete line of venous access products
          which are
          marketed for infusion therapy.

Neuromodulation

Cochlear
          Implants

We
          develop and market in the U.S., Europe and Japan the HiResolution® 90K Cochlear
          Implant System to restore hearing to the profoundly deaf. The technology
          consists of an external sound processor, which captures and processes sound
          information from the environment and transmits the digital information
          through
          the skin to the implant. The implant delivers digital pulses of electrical
          current to precise locations on the auditory nerve, which the brain perceives
          as
          sound. In September 2006, our next-generation cochlear implant technology,
          the
          Harmony

™

HiResolution Bionic Ear System was approved by the FDA. We commercially
          launched
          this product on a limited basis in late 2006 and anticipate a full launch
          in early 2007.

Pain
          Management

We
          market
          the Precision® Spinal Cord Stimulation System for the treatment of chronic pain
          of the lower back and legs. This system delivers advanced pain management
          by
          applying a small electrical signal to mask pain signals traveling from
          the
          spinal cord to the brain. The Precision System utilizes a rechargeable
          battery
          and features a patient-directed fitting system for fast and effective
          programming. The Precision System is also being assessed for use in
          treating migraine pain.

Marketing
          and Sales

Dedicated
          sales forces of approximately 2,400 individuals in approximately 45 countries
          internationally and over 3,400 individuals in the U.S. marketed our products
          worldwide as of December 31, 2006. Sales in countries where we have direct
          sales organizations accounted for approximately 94 percent of our net sales
          during 2006. A network of distributors and dealers who offer our products
          in
          more than 50 countries worldwide accounts for our remaining sales. We also
          have
          a dedicated corporate sales organization in the U.S. focused principally
          on
          selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks.

In
          2006,
          we sold our products to over 10,000 hospitals, clinics, out-patient facilities
          and medical offices. We are not dependent on any single institution and
          no
          single institution accounted for more than 10 percent of our net sales in
          2006. Large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other
          buying
          groups have, however, become increasingly important to our business and
          represent a substantial portion of our U.S. net sales.

We
          also
          distribute certain products for third parties, including an introducer
          sheath
          and certain guidewires, as well as BPH devices, various graft materials,
          and
          pneumatic and laser lithotripters for use in connection with urology and
          gynecology procedures. Our agreement to distribute certain guidewire and
          sheath
          products expired during the first quarter of 2006. While we have identified
          replacements for these products, the sales level associated with the replacement
          products has been, as expected, less than that of our previously distributed
          products. Together, these distributed products represented less than two
          percent of our 2006 net sales. Leveraging our sales and marketing strength,
          we
          expect to continue to seek new opportunities for distributing complementary
          products as well as new technologies.

International
          Operations

Internationally,
          through 2006, we operated through three business units divided among the
          geographic regions of Europe, Japan and Inter-Continental. Maintaining
          and
          expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term
          growth plan. Through our international presence, we seek to

increase
          net sales and market share, leverage relationships with leading physicians
          and
          their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products
          to
          market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that may
          be
          implemented across our product lines. After our acquisition of Guidant,
          we
          integrated Guidant’s international sales operations into our geographic regions.
          Consistent with our geographic focus, the Guidant CRM business became a
          business
          unit within each country organization across Europe, Japan and
          Inter-Continental. In the first quarter of 2007, we began operating through
          four
          international business units: Europe, Asia Pacific/Japan, Inter-Continental
          and
          Distributor Management.

International
          sales accounted for approximately 38 percent of our net sales in 2006. Net
          sales and operating income attributable to significant geographic areas
          are
          presented in

Note N—Segment
          Reporting

to our
          2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
          Form 10-K.

In
          recent
          years, we have expanded our direct sales presence worldwide so as to be
          in a
          position to take advantage of expanding market opportunities. As of
          December 31, 2006, we had direct marketing and sales operations in
          approximately 45 countries internationally. We believe that we will continue
          to
          leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and
          to use
          third parties in those markets where it is not economical or strategic
          to
          establish a direct presence.

We
          have
          five international manufacturing facilities in Ireland, one in Costa Rica
          and
          one in Puerto Rico. Presently, approximately 33 percent of our products
          sold
          worldwide are manufactured at these facilities. We also maintain an
          international research and development


[Table
              of Contents]

facility
          in Ireland, a training facility in Tokyo, Japan, and a training and research
          and
          development center in Miyazaki, Japan. We currently share a training facility
          in
          Brussels, Belgium with Abbott.

Manufacturing
          and Raw Materials

We
          design
          and manufacture the majority of our products in technology centers around
          the
          world. Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily
          fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items
          available from multiple supply sources. Certain items are custom made for
          us to
          meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity
          exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available
          or
          could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an
          ongoing
          program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative
          back-up
          supplies. However, in certain cases, we may not be able to quickly

establish
          additional or replacement suppliers for specific components or materials,
          largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of
          the
          manufacturing processes employed by us and many suppliers. A reduction
          or
          interruption in supply, an inability to develop and validate alternative
          sources
          if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw materials or
          components could adversely affect our operations and financial condition,
          particularly materials or components related to our TAXUS® and PROMUS™
drug-eluting coronary stent systems and our CRM products.

Quality
          Assurance

On
          January 26, 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning
          letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three
          of our
          facilities and advising us that our corporate-wide corrective action plan
          relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was
          inadequate.

As
          stated
          in this FDA warning letter, the FDA may not grant our requests for exportation
          certificates to foreign governments or approve pre-market approval (PMA)
          applications for class III devices to which the quality control or current
          good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably
          related until the deficiencies have been corrected. During 2005, in order
          to
          strengthen our corporate-wide quality controls, we established Project
          Horizon a
          corporate-wide cross-functional initiative to improve and harmonize our
          overall
          quality processes and systems. As part of Project Horizon, we have made
          modifications to our process validation and complaint management
          systems. Project Horizon resulted in the reallocation of significant
          internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives, as
          well as
          incremental spending, which has resulted in adjustments to product launch
          schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other
          product lines over time.

In
          2006,
          our Board of Directors created a Compliance and Quality Committee to monitor
          our
          compliance and quality initiatives. We believe we have identified solutions
          to
          the quality issues cited by the FDA, and we continue to make progress in
          transitioning our organization to implement those solutions. We communicate
          frequently and meet regularly with the FDA to apprise them of our progress.
          The
          FDA has communicated the need for us to complete substantially our
          remediation efforts before they will re-inspect our facilities. We have
          engaged
          a third party to audit our enhanced quality systems in order to assess
          our
          Company-wide compliance prior to re-inspection by the FDA. We believe we
          will be
          ready for third-party audit in the second quarter of 2007.

On
          December 23, 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing certain
          deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and record
          keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. This FDA
          warning
          letter followed an inspection by the FDA that was completed on September 1,
          2005 and cited a number of observations. Guidant received a follow-up letter
          from the FDA dated January 5, 2006. As stated in this follow-up letter,
          until we have corrected the


[Table
              of Contents]

identified
          deficiencies, the FDA may not grant requests for exportation certificates
          to
          foreign governments or approve PMA applications for class III devices to
          which the deficiencies described are reasonably related. The FDA conducted
          a
          further inspection of the CRM facility between December 15, 2005 and
          February 9, 2006 and made one additional inspectional
          observation.

The
          FDA
          has concluded its reinspection of our CRM facilities. While we believe
          this
          reinspection went well, we may be required to take additional actions in
          order
          to comply with any FDA observations that we may receive.

We
          are
          committed to providing high quality products to our customers. To meet
          this
          commitment, we are implementing updated quality systems and concepts throughout
          our organization. Our quality system starts with the initial product
          specification and continues through the design of the product, component
          specification process and the manufacturing, sales and servicing of the
          product.
          Our quality system is designed to build in quality and process control
          and to
          utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These
          systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the quality system regulations
          of
          the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. Many of our operations
          are
          certified under ISO 9001, ISO 9002, ISO 13485, ISO 13488, EN 46001 and
          EN 46002
          international quality system standards. ISO 9002 requires, among other
          items, an
          implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier
          control
          and manufacturing operations. In addition, ISO 9001 and EN 46001 require
          an
          implemented quality system that applies to product design. These certifications
          can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an
          independent outside auditor. Maintenance of these certifications requires
          that
          these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.

We
          maintain an ongoing initiative to seek ISO 14001 certification at our plants
          around the world. ISO 14001, the environmental management system standard
          in the
          ISO 14000 series, provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental
          aspects associated with our businesses. We engage in continuous environmental
          performance improvement around these aspects. At present, nine of our
          manufacturing and distribution facilities have attained ISO 14001 certification.
          This initiative is expected to continue until each of our manufacturing
          facilities, including those we acquire, becomes certified.

Competition

We
          encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each
          market in
          which our products are sold from various companies, some of which may have
          greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors
          have historically included Johnson & Johnson (including its subsidiary,
          Cordis Corporation) and Medtronic, Inc. (including its subsidiary,
          Medtronic AVE, Inc.), as well as a wide range of companies which sell a
          single or limited number of competitive products or participate only in
          a
          specific market segment. Since we acquired Guidant, Abbott Laboratories
          has
          become a competitor of ours in the interventional cardiology market and
          St. Jude
          Medical, Inc. has become a competitor of ours in the CRM market, in
          addition to the Neuromodulation market. We also face competition from
          non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may
          offer
          alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our
          products.

We
          believe that our products compete primarily on the basis of their ability
          to
          safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in
          a
          less-invasive manner, including ease of use, reliability and physician
          familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated
          buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition
          and
          declining reimbursement rates, we have also increasingly been required
          to
          compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We
          believe that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability
          to
          create or acquire scientifically advanced technology, apply our


[Table
              of Contents]

technology
          cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,
          develop or acquire proprietary products, attract and retain skilled development
          personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required
          regulatory and reimbursement approvals, continually enhance our quality
          systems, manufacture and successfully market our products either directly
          or
          through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer
          demand.

Regulation

The
          medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation
          by
          numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international
          regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices
          to
          comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development,
          testing,
          manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices.
          Devices
          are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most
          comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted
          before a device receives approval for commercial distribution.

In
          the
          U.S., permission to distribute a new device generally can be met in one
          of two
          ways. The first process requires that a pre-market notification (a 510(k)
          Submission) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe
          and
          effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device
          that is
          not subject to pre-market approval (PMA) (i.e., the “predicate” device). An
          appropriate predicate device for a pre-market notification is one that
          (i) was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, (ii) was approved
          under a PMA but then subsequently reclassified from class III to
          class II or I, or (iii) has been found to be substantially equivalent
          and cleared for commercial distribution under a 510(k) Submission. Applicants
          must submit descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data to establish
          that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. In some
          instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support
          of
          a 510(k) Submission. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that
          conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations.
          The FDA must issue an order finding substantial equivalence before commercial
          distribution can occur. Changes to existing devices covered by a 510(k)
          Submission which do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness
          can
          generally be made by us without additional 510(k) Submissions. More significant
          changes, such as new designs or materials, may require a separate 510(k)
          with
          data to support that the modified device remains substantially equivalent.

The
          second process requires that an application for PMA be made to the FDA
          to
          demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use
          as
          manufactured. This approval process applies to certain class III devices.
          In this case, two steps of FDA approval are generally required before marketing
          in the U.S. can begin. First, we must comply with the applicable IDE regulations
          in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device in the
          U.S.
          Second, the FDA must review our PMA application which contains, among other
          things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. The FDA will approve
          the
          PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the
          device
          is safe and effective for its intended purpose.

The
          FDA
          can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded
          medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices;
          and
          require notification of health professionals and others with regard to
          medical
          devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public
          health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the
          Food,
          Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical
          devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations.
          International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are
          not
          approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or are banned or deviate from
          lawful
          performance standards, are subject to FDA export

              of Contents]

requirements.
          Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country
          to
          which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device
          regulations, but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated.
          Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country
          prior
          to application in the U.S. to take advantage of differing regulatory
          requirements. Most countries outside of the United States require that
          product
          approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years.
          The
          recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and
          any new
          regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate
          testing
          to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are
          required, they must be approved in order to continue to sell our products
          in
          those countries.

In
          the
          European Union, we are required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive
          and
          obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE
          Mark
          certification, granted following approval from an independent Notified
          Body, is
          an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and
          compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. We also
          comply
          with all other foreign regulations such as the requirement that we obtain
          Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approval before we can launch new
          products
          in Japan, including our TAXUS® Express


coronary
          stent system. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market
          our
          products may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S., and
          requirements for such approval may differ from those required by the FDA.

We
          are
          also subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations
          both in
          the U.S. and abroad. Our operations, like those of other medical device
          companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental
          laws,
          primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that
          compliance with environmental laws will not have a material impact on our
          capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Given the scope
          and
          nature of these laws, however, there can be no assurance that environmental
          laws
          will not have a material impact on our results of operations. We assess
          potential environmental contingent liabilities on a quarterly basis. At
          present,
          we are not aware of any such liabilities which would have a material impact
          on
          our business. We are also certified with respect to the enhanced environmental
          FTSE4Good criteria and are a constituent member of the London Stock
          Exchange

’

s
          FTSE4Good Index, which recognizes companies that meet certain corporate
          responsibility standards.

Third-Party
          Coverage and Reimbursement

Our
          products are purchased by hospitals, doctors and other healthcare providers
          who
          are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g.,
          Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs,
          for
          the healthcare services provided to their patients. Third-party payors
          may
          provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures
          based on assessment criteria as determined by the third-party payor.
          Reimbursement by third-party payors for these services is based on a wide
          range
          of methodologies that may reflect the services’ assessed resource costs,
          clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies
          confer
          different, and often conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives
          to
          healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies are subject
          to
          frequent refinements. Third-party payors are also increasingly adjusting
          reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products
          and
          services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically
          covered by third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or,
          if
          available, that the third-party payors’ coverage policies will not adversely
          affect our ability to sell our products profitably.

Initiatives
          to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are
          also
          underway in many countries in which we do business. Implementation of cost
          containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such
          as
          Japan, Europe and other international markets may limit the


[Table
              of Contents]

price
          of,
          or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products and may
          influence a physician’s selection of products used to treat patients.

Proprietary
          Rights and Patent Litigation

We
          rely
          on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure
          agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent
          applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection
          for our
          technology is appropriate and available. We hold approximately 6,000 U.S.
          patents (many of which have foreign counterparts) and have more than 8,600
          patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our
          technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to
          a
          variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications.
          There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result
          in issued
          patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged
          or
          circumvented by competitors, or that such patents will be found to be valid
          or
          sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive
          advantage.

We
          rely
          on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants
          and
          other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary
          technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be
          breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others
          will
          not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third
          parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary
          knowledge.

There
          has
          been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property
          rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which
          we
          compete. We have defended, and will continue to defend, ourself against
          claims
          and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others.
          Adverse
          determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant
          liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties,
          and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling
          or
          using certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect
          on us.

Additionally,
          we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights,
          to
          protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity
          of
          the proprietary rights of others. Patent litigation can be costly and
          time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses
          will
          not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will
          be
          favorable to us. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our
          pending
          litigation. Settlement may include cross-licensing of the patents which
          are the
          subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and
          may
          involve monetary payments to or from third parties.

Note J—Commitments
          and Contingencies

to our
          2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
          Form 10-K for a further discussion of patent and other litigation and
          proceedings in which we are involved. In management’s opinion, we are not
          currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically
          identified in Note J to our consolidated financial statements, which,
          individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on our financial
          condition, operations or cash flows.

Risk
          Management

The
          testing, marketing and sale of human healthcare products entails an inherent
          risk of product liability claims. We are involved in various lawsuits arising
          in
          the normal course of business from product liability and securities claims.
          We
          are substantially self-insured with respect to general, product liability
          and
          securities claims. As a result of the economic factors currently impacting
          the
          insurance industry, meaningful liability insurance coverage became unavailable
          due to its economically prohibitive cost.


[Table
              of Contents]

In
          connection with our acquisition of Guidant, the number of product liability
          claims and other legal proceedings filed against us, including private
          securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, significantly increased.
          Product liability and securities claims against us may be asserted in the
          future
          related to unknown events at the present time. The absence of significant
          third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated
          claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, product recalls,
          securities litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of
          their
          outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe
          that
          our risk management practices, including limited insurance coverage, are
          reasonably adequate to protect against anticipated general, product liability
          and securities litigation losses. However, unanticipated catastrophic losses
          could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results
          of
          operations and liquidity.

Employees

As
          of
          December 31, 2006, we had approximately 28,600 employees, including
          approximately 14,300 in operations, 2,000 in administration, 4,600 in clinical,
          regulatory and research and development and 7,700 in selling, marketing,
          distribution and related administrative support. Of these employees,
          approximately 14,500 were employed outside the U.S., approximately 6,200 of
          which are included in the Operations function. We believe that the
          continued success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability
          to
          attract and retain qualified personnel.

Seasonality

Our
          worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however,
          customer purchases have been lighter in the third quarter of prior years
          than in
          other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during
          summer
          months, particularly in European countries.

Several
          important factors, in addition to the specific factors discussed in connection
          with each forward-looking statement individually and the risk factors described
          in Item 1A under the heading “Risk Factors,” could affect our future results and
          growth rates and could cause those results and rates to differ materially
          from
          those expressed in the forward-looking statements and the risk factors
          contained
          in this report. These additional factors include, among other things, future
          economic, competitive, reimbursement and regulatory conditions, new product
          introductions, demographic trends, intellectual property, financial market
          conditions and future business decisions made by us and our competitors,
          all of
          which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which

          with
          each forward-looking statement and risk factor in this report and as disclosed
          in our filings with the SEC. These factors, in some cases, have affected
          and in
          the future (together with other factors) could affect our ability to implement
          our business strategy and may cause actual results to differ materially

          those contemplated by the statements expressed in this report.

ITEM
          1A. RISK FACTORS

In
          addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the
          exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully
          in
          evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of
          operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
          This
          section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation
          of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set
          forth at
          the end of Item 1 of this Form 10-K. Additional risks not presently known
          to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our
          business, financial condition or results of operations.


[Table
              of Contents]

We
            derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of drug-eluting
            coronary stent systems and a decline in market size or our market share
            of
            drug-eluting stents may adversely affect our results of operations or
            financial
            condition.

Drug-eluting
          coronary stent revenues represented
          approximately 30 percent of our consolidated net sales during the fiscal
          year
          ended December 31, 2006. Our U.S. TAXUS sales declined in 2006 relative to
          2005, due in part to a decline in the U.S. market size attributable to
          recent
          uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use
          of
          drug-eluting stents. Late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot,
          or
          thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after implantation of
          the
          stent.

In
          the
          fourth quarter of 2006, the FDA held a special ad

visory
          panel meeting to discuss drug-eluting stents. If concerns about the risk
          of late
          stent thrombosis persist, there can be no assurance that the market will
          return
          to previous levels.

In
          addition, lower device utilization per procedure and a decline in the overall
          percutaneous coronary intervention market contributed to the decline in
          our
          TAXUS stent system sales in 2006. There can be no assurance that these
          concerns
          will be alleviated in the near term or that drug-eluting stent penetration
          rates
          will return to previous levels. Our TAXUS® coronary stent system and Johnson
& Johnson’s CYPHER® drug-eluting stent system are currently the only two
          drug-eluting stents available in the U.S. market. We expect our share of
          the
          drug-eluting stent market, as well as unit prices, to continue to be adversely
          affected as additional significant competitors enter the drug-eluting stent
          market, which began during the third quarter of 2005 internationally and
          is
          expected to continue to occur as early as the second half of 2007 in the
          U.S. In
          July 2005, Medtronic, Inc. received approval from European regulators
          to begin commercial sales of its Endeavor® drug-eluting stent system in the
          European market. As a result of Abbott’s acquisition of Guidant’s drug-eluting
          stent portfolio, Abbott sells its XIENCE™ V everolimus-eluting stent system in
          competition with us in certain international markets. In addition, Conor
          Medsystems, Inc., which was recently acquired by Johnson & Johnson,
          sells its CoStar® paclitaxel-eluting stent system in competition with us in
          certain international markets.

The
          manufacture of our TAXUS® coronary stent system involves the integration of
          multiple technologies, critical components, raw materials and complex processes.
          Significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand, as well
          as
          disruptions associated with our TAXUS® stent manufacturing process, may impact
          our inventory levels. Variability in expected demand or the timing of the
          launch
          of next-generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions
          and future inventory charges, which may adversely impact our results from
          operations. We share with Abbott rights to Guidant’s XIENCE™ V
          everolimus-eluting stent program. As a result, delays in receipt of regulatory
          approvals for the XIENCE™ V everolimus-eluting stent system, receipt of
          insufficient quantities of the PROMUS everolimus-eluting stent from Abbott
          or
          material nonacceptance of these stents in the marketplace could adversely
          affect
          our results from operations, as well as our ability to effectively differentiate
          ourselves from our competitors in the drug-eluting stent market as the
          leading
          company with two drug-eluting stent programs.

The
          worldwide CRM market growth rates declined during 2006 and if the CRM market
          does not recover, our results of operation and financial condition may
          be
          adversely impacted.

During
          2005 and 2006, the operating and financial performance of our CRM business
          has
          been adversely impacted by various implantable defibrillator and pacemaker
          system field actions in the industry and a corresponding reduction in CRM
          market
          growth rates. We believe that field actions in the industry contributed
          to our
          CRM division having a lower market share for implantable defibrillator
          and
          pacemaker systems for 2006 as compared to 2005. The worldwide CRM market
          growth
          rate, including the U.S. defibrillator market growth rate, declined during
          the
          first three quarters of 2006; these growth levels are below those experienced
          in
          recent years. The U.S. defibrillator market represents approximately half
          of the
          worldwide CRM market. There can be no assurance that the CRM market will
          return
          to its historical growth rate


[Table
              of Contents]

or
          that
          we will be able to regain CRM market share or increase net sales in a timely
          manner, if at all.

Because
            we derive a significant amount of our revenues from our cardiovascular
            business,
            changes in market or regulatory conditions that impact that business
            or our
            inability to develop non-cardiovascular products, could have a material
            adverse
            effect on our business, financial condition or results of
            operation.

During
            2006, approximately 80 percent of our net sales were derived from our
            cardiovascular business, which includes our interventional cardiology,
            cardiac
            rhythm management and cardiovascular divisions. As a result, our sales
            growth
            and profitability from our cardiovascular business may be limited by
            risks and
            uncertainties related to market or regulatory conditions that impact
            that
            business.  For example, if the worldwide CRM market and the U.S. ICD market
            do not return to their historical growth rates or we are unable to regain
            CRM
            market share or increase CRM net sales, it may adversely affect our business,
            financial condition or results of operation.  Coronary stent revenue
            represented approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net sales for
            2006.  If the decline in U.S. drug-eluting stent market penetration
            attributable to concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis
            following
            the use of drug-eluting stents or the declines in device utilization
            per
            procedure and overall percutaneous coronary intervention volumes continue,
            there
            can be no assurance that the drug-eluting stent market will recover to
            previous
            levels which may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Similarly, our inability to develop products and technologies successfully
            in
            addition to our drug-eluting stent and cardiac rhythm management technologies
            could further expose us to fluctuations and uncertainties in these
            markets.

We
          may be unable to resolve issues related to our warning letters in a timely
          manner, which could delay the production and sale of our products and have
          an
          adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
          operation.

We
          are
          currently taking remedial action in response to certain deficiencies of
          our
          quality systems as cited by the FDA in its warning letters to us. For example,
          on January 26, 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA
          notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities
          and
          advising us that our corrective action plan relating to three site-specific
          warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As stated in this
          FDA
          warning letter, the FDA may not grant our requests for exportation certificates
          to foreign governments or approve pre-market approval (PMA) applications
          for our
          class III devices to which the quality control or current good
          manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably
          related until the deficiencies have been corrected. If we are unable to
          resolve
          the issues raised by the FDA in its warning letters to the satisfaction
          of the
          FDA on a timely basis, we may not be able to launch our new class III
          devices as planned, including our Taxus® Liberté™ drug-eluting stent system in
          the United States, which may weaken our competitive position in the markets
          in
          which we participate.

In
          addition, in December 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing
          certain deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems
          and
          record keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. This
          FDA
          warning letter followed an inspection by the FDA that was completed on
          September 1, 2005 and cited a number of observations. Guidant received a
          follow-up letter from the FDA dated January 5, 2006. As stated in this
          follow-up letter, until the identified deficiencies have been corrected,
          the FDA
          may not grant requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments
          or
          approve PMA applications for class III devices to which the
          deficiencies described are reasonably related. The FDA conducted a further
          inspection of the CRM facility between December 15, 2005 and
          February 9, 2006 and made one additional inspectional observation. The FDA
          has concluded its reinspection of our CRM facilities. We may be required
          to take
          additional actions in order to comply with any FDA observations that we
          may
          receive.

We
          may
          face enforcement actions in connection with these FDA warning letters,
          including
          injunctive relief, consent decrees or civil fines. While we are working
          with the
          FDA to resolve these issues, this work has required and will continue to
          require
          the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources
          and
          has resulted in adjustments to the product launch schedules of certain
          products
          and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time.
          There can
          be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to
          resolve
          these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA. In addition, if our remedial
          actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional
          financial and human resources to our efforts and the FDA may take further
          regulatory actions against us including, but not limited to, seizing our
          product
          inventory, obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our
          products, assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree
          on us,
          which could result in further regulatory constraints, including the governance
          of our quality system by a third party. If we or our manufacturers fail
          to
          adhere to QSR or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products
          and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls
          or
          other consequences, which could in turn have a material adverse effect
          on our
          financial condition or results of operations.

We
          are subject to extensive medical device regulation which may impede or
          hinder
          the approval process for our products and, in some cases, may not ultimately
          result in approval or may result in the recall or seizure of previously
          approved
          products.

Our
          products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject
          to
          extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the federal Food,
          Drug,
          and Cosmetic Act (the FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries,
          and
          by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical
          devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially
          marketed in the U.S. In addition, most major markets for medical devices
          outside
          the U.S. require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards
          before
          a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining marketing
          approval or clearance from the FDA for new products, or with respect to
          enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:

•
take
          a
          significant period of time;

•
require
          the expenditure of substantial resources;

•
involve
          rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing;

•
require
          changes to the products; and

•
result
          in limitations on the indicated uses of the products.

Countries
          around the world have recently adopted more stringent regulatory requirements
          that are expected to add to the delays and uncertainties associated with
          new
          product releases, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting
          those releases. Even after products have received marketing approval or
          clearance, product approvals and clearances by the FDA can be withdrawn
          due to
          failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen
          problems following initial approval. There can be no assurance that we
          will
          receive the required clearances from the FDA for new products or modifications
          to existing products on a timely basis or that any FDA approval will not
          be
          subsequently withdrawn.

In
          addition, regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of
          medical
          devices are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if
          any,
          those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory
          requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
          condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown
          problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or
          suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products,
          operating
          restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. The failure to receive product
          approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances,
          seizures or recalls of products or the withdrawal of product approval by
          the FDA
          could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
          or
          results of operations.

We
          may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing
          and
          quality processes, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
          financial
          condition or results of operations.

As
          a
          device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject
          to
          periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System
          Regulation (QSR) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices
          to
          adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and
          documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting
          regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there
          is
          evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed
          to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could
          cause or
          contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory
          requirements is subject to continual review and is


[Table
              of Contents]

rigorously
          monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community,
          we
          are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our
          products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain
          and
          maintain these certifications.

Pending
          and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive
          to
          us.

We
          operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual
          property
          litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the
          medical
          device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies
          in
          order to prevent the marketing of new devices. We are currently the subject
          of
          various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in
          more
          detail under

Item
          3. Legal Proceedings.

Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and
          its
          outcome is difficult to predict. Pending or future patent litigation may
          result
          in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent
          the
          sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical
          and
          management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our
          products
          is successfully challenged, and if we fail to obtain a required license
          or are
          unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or
          results
          of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We
          may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property rights
          which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
          or
          results of operations.

The
          medical device market in which we primarily participate is in large part
          technology driven. Physician customers, particularly in interventional
          cardiology, move quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result,
          intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play
          a
          significant role in product development and differentiation. However,
          intellectual property litigation to defend or create market advantage is
          inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts frequently
          overturn lower court patent decisions.

In
          addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage
          patent
          portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance
          risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors
          are
          parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings,
          or
          litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently
          drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of
          pending
          and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary
          and
          injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally
          not determined until the conclusion of the proceedings and are frequently
          modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult
          to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes
          of other
          cases in other geographies.

Several
          third parties have asserted that our current and former stent systems or
          other
          products infringe patents owned or licensed by them. Adverse outcomes in
          one or more of these proceedings against us could limit our ability to
          sell
          certain stent products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating
          margin
          on the sale of these products. In addition, damage awards related to historical
          sales could be material. We have similarly asserted that stent systems
          or other
          products sold by these companies infringe patents owned or licensed by
          us.

Patents
          and other proprietary rights are and will be essential to our business,
          and our
          ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon
          the
          proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how,
          continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing
          opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position.
          We
          pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S.
          and
          abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and also
          attempt
          to review


[Table
              of Contents]

third-party
          patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop
          an
          effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify
          licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently
          own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications
          pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which
          patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash,
          cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that
          any
          pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents, that
          any
          current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged
          or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found
          invalid.

In
          addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our
          patents,
          trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement
          by
          others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming
          to us
          and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful. We are
          generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent
          infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. We are involved
          in
          numerous patent-related claims with our competitors, including
          Johnson & Johnson.

The
          invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an
          unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property,
          could
          have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results
          of
          operations.

Pending
          and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private
          securities litigation, shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation,
          may
          adversely affect our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain
          customers.

The
          design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that
          we
          produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Many of the
          medical
          devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the
          human
          body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could
          result
          in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect
          to
          these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including component
          failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure
          of
          product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could
          result
          in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or
          a safety
          alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims
          may be
          brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.

We
          are
          currently the subject of numerous product liability claims and other litigation,
          including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits
          including, but not limited to, the claims and litigation described under

Item 3. Legal
          Proceedings

.
          In
          connection with our acquisition of Guidant, the number of product liability
          claims and other legal proceedings filed against us, including private
          securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, significantly increased.
          We are currently involved in litigation involving a contract dispute with
          certain former shareholders of Advanced Bionics Corporation, one of our
          subsidiaries. The outcome of this litigation could prevent us from operating
          the
          Advanced Bionics business in the manner that we expected at the time of
          acquisition.

The
          outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult
          to
          assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery
          of
          very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages,
          but also
          punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential loss relating to these
          lawsuits
          may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost
          to
          defend against any future litigation may be significant. Further, we are
          substantially self-insured with respect to general, product liability claims
          and
          securities litigation. As a result of economic factors currently impacting
          the
          insurance industry, meaningful product liability and


[Table
              of Contents]

securities
          litigation insurance coverage has become unavailable due to its economically
          prohibitive cost. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage
          increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions.
          Product liability claims, product recalls, securities litigation and other
          litigation in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material
          adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

We
          may not be successful in our strategic acquisitions of, investments in
          or
          alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant
          source of historical growth for us.

Our
          strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to further
          expand
          our ability to offer customers effective, high quality medical devices
          that
          satisfy their interventional needs. Many of these alliances involve equity
          investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or
          assets
          of the other company in the future. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions,
          investments and alliances, we may be unable to continue to grow our business
          significantly or may record asset impairment charges in the future. These
          acquisitions, investments and alliances have

been
          significant sources of growth for us. The success of any acquisition, investment
          or alliance that we may undertake will depend on a number of factors,
          including:

•

our
          ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment
          or
          alliance, if at all;

•

our
          ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms
          acceptable to us, if at all;

•

whether
          we are able to establish an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms
          that
          are satisfactory to us, if at all;

•

the
          strength of the other companies’ underlying technology and ability to execute;

•

intellectual
          property and litigation related to these technologies; and

•

our
          ability to successfully integrate the acquired company or business with
          our
          existing business, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process
          research and development projects.

If
          we are
          unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be
          unable to
          continue to grow our business significantly or may record asset impairment
          charges in the future.

We
          incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of
          Guidant
          and if we are unable to manage our debt levels and maintain our investment-grade
          credit ratings, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition
          or
          results of operations.

We
          had
          outstanding borrowings of $8.9 billion at December 31, 2006, attributable
          in
          large part to our acquisition of Guidant. We will be required to use a
          significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding
          debt
          obligations over the next several years. We are examining all of our operations
          in order to identify cost improvement measures that will better align operating
          expenses with expected revenue levels and cash flow, and may decide to
          sell
          certain non-strategic assets or implement other strategic initiatives to
          generate proceeds that would be available for debt repayment. Certain of
          our
          debt agreements contain financial covenants that require us to maintain
          specified financial ratios. If we are unable to maintain these ratios,
          we may be
          required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made
          that
          our lenders


[Table
              of Contents]

would
          grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all. While our credit ratings
          are
          currently investment grade, our Moody’s and S&P ratings outlooks are
          currently negative. Our inability to maintain our investment grade credit
          ratings could make it more expensive for us to borrow funds or issue debt
          securities in the public capital markets on terms reasonably acceptable
          to
          us.

Our
          future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, which
          requires
          significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals,
          all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in
          a
          commercially viable product.

In
          order
          to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we focus
          our
          research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation
          and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions,
          particularly in our drug-eluting stent and CRM programs. We expect to
          launch our TAXUS® Liberté™ coronary stent system in the U.S., subject to
          regulatory approval. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our
          CRM
          technologies, including our LATITUDE® Patient Management System and the
          Frontier

™

CRM
          technology. If we are unable to develop and launch these and other products
          as
          anticipated, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the
          drug-eluting stent and CRM markets may be adversely impacted.

Further,
          we expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug-eluting stent
          and CRM
          technologies. There can be no assurance that these or other technologies
          will
          achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market
          acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies
          or our
          decision to reduce funding of these projects may adversely impact the
          contribution of these technologies to our future growth.

As
          a part
          of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA
          for new
          products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a
          variety
          of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable
          or
          inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted
          by
          us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market’s perception of this
          clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals
          from
          the FDA, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate
          and
          our business, financial condition, results of operations or future
          prospects.

We
          face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid
          technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have
          an
          adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The
          medical device market is highly competitive. We encounter significant
          competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products
          are sold from various medical device companies, some of which may have
          greater
          financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors have
          historically included Johnson & Johnson (including its subsidiary,
          Cordis Corporation) and Medtronic, Inc. (including its subsidiary,
          Medtronic AVE, Inc.). Through our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott has become
          a primary competitor of ours in the interventional cardiology market and
          St.
          Jude Medical, Inc. has become a competitor of ours in the CRM market and in
          the Neuromodulation market. In addition, we face competition from a wide
          range
          of companies that sell a single or a limited number of competitive products
          or
          which participate only in a specific market segment, as well as from non-medical
          device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer
          alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our
          products.

Additionally,
          the medical device market is characterized by extensive research and
          development, and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies
          of
          new or improved products,


[Table
              of Contents]

processes
          or technologies, in particular in the drug-eluting stent and CRM markets,
          may
          make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and
          may
          negatively impact our revenues. We are required to devote continued efforts
          and
          financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies
          and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines
          and
          markets, attract and retain skilled development personnel, obtain patent
          and
          other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory
          and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our
          products
          consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop new products
          or
          enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our
          business, financial condition or results of operations.

Because
          we derive a significant amount of our revenues from international operations
          and
          a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from
          international operations, changes in international economic or regulatory
          conditions could have a material impact on our business, financial condition
          or
          results of operations.

Sales
          outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 38 percent of our net sales
          in
          2006. Additionally, a significant percentage of our future growth is expected
          to
          come from international operations. As a result, our sales growth and
          profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks
          and
          uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, foreign
          currency
          fluctuations, exchange rate fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement
          approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to
          intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business
          strategy. Further, international markets are also being affected by economic
          pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. The trend
          in
          countries around the world, including Japan, toward more stringent regulatory
          requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models and more
          rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or
          may cause
          medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty, delay, risk
          and
          expense. In addition, we are required to renew regulatory approvals and
          obtain
          exportation certificates to foreign governments in order to market our
          products
          in certain international jurisdictions, which may require additional testing
          and
          documentation. These approvals and certificates have been impacted by the
          FDA
          warning letters we have received. If sufficient resources are not available
          to
          renew these approvals or these approvals are not timely renewed, our ability
          to
          market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may
          be
          limited. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, legal,
          regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international
          operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition
          or
          results of operations.

Healthcare
          cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting
          in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors or preferences
          for
          alternate therapies could decrease the demand for our products, the prices
          which
          customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures
          performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our
          business,
          financial condition or results of operations.

Our
          products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically
          bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs (e.g.,
          Medicare
          and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the
          healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers
          to
          obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private
          and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical
          technology companies. The availability of reimbursement affects which products
          customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement
          varies
          from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of
          new
          products and services. After we develop a promising new product, we may
          find
          limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained
          from
          private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or
          administrative


[Table
              of Contents]

reforms
          to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems in a manner that
          significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices
          or
          denies coverage for those procedures could have a material adverse effect
          on our
          business, financial condition or results of operations.

Major
          third-party payors for hospital services in the U.S. and abroad continue
          to work
          to contain healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives,
          combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private
          health
          insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual
          adjustments to hospital charges for services performed and has shifted
          services
          between inpatient and outpatient settings. Initiatives to limit the increase
          of
          healthcare costs, including price regulation, are also underway in several
          countries in which we do business. Hospitals or physicians may respond
          to these
          cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other
          therapies for our products. In light of the Guidant product recalls, third-party
          payors may seek claims and further recourse against us for the recalled
          defibrillator and pacemaker systems for which Guidant had previously received
          reimbursement.

Consolidation
          in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions
          or the
          exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments,
          which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
          or
          results of operations.

The
          cost
          of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous
          initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party
          payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the
          healthcare industry, including hospitals. This in turn has resulted in
          greater
          pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important
          market
          segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks
          and
          large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for
          some of
          our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation,
          third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue
          to
          change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business
          consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which
          may
          reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our
          products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or
          results
          of operations.

We
          rely on external manufacturers to supply us with materials and components
          used
          in our products and any disruption of such sources of supply could adversely
          impact our production efforts.

We
          vertically integrate operations where integration provides significant
          cost,
          supply or quality benefits. However, we purchase many of the materials
          and
          components used in manufacturing our products, some of which are custom
          made.
          Certain supplies are purchased from single-sources due to quality
          considerations, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
          We
          may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for certain
          components or materials in a timely manner largely due to the complex nature
          of
          our and many of our suppliers’ manufacturing processes. Production issues,
          including capacity constraint; quality issues affecting us or our suppliers;
          an
          inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a
          significant increase in the price of materials or components could adversely
          affect our operations and financial condition.

ITEM
        7.       MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
        AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
        OPERATIONS

Overview

Boston
        Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer
        of
        medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical
        specialties. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the
        productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy
        of
        less-invasive medical devices and procedures. This mission is accomplished
        through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and
        the
        investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma,
        cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare. Our approach to innovation
        combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain
        externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our quality
        policy,
        applicable to all employees, is “I improve the quality of patient care and all
        things Boston Scientific.”

Our
        management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an overview of the
        Guidant acquisition, which represents a transforming event for Boston
        Scientific. It then provides an executive summary that outlines our financial
        highlights during 2006 and identifies some key trends that impacted operating
        results during the year. We supplement this summary with an in-depth look
        at the
        major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects.
        Next is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for
        as compared to 2005 and our operating results for 2005 as compared to 2004.
        The
        discussion then provides an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily
        on
        material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as
        depicted in our consolidated statements of cash flows, and the trends underlying
        these changes. Finally, the MD&A provides information on our critical
        accounting policies.

Guidant
        Acquisition and Abbott Transaction

On
        April
        21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant Corporation for an aggregate
        purchase price of $28.4 billion, which represented a combination of cash,
        common
        stock and fully vested stock options

.

The
        purchase price net of cash acquired was approximately $21.7 billion. In
        conjunction with the acquisition, we acquired approximately $6.7 billion
        of
        cash, including $4.1 billion in connection with Guidant’s prior sale of its
        vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott
        Laboratories. With this acquisition, we have

become a
        major provider in the more than $9 billion global Cardiac Rhythm Management
        (CRM) business, enhancing our overall competitive position and long-term
        growth
        potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. The acquisition
        has
        established us as one of the world’s largest cardiovascular device companies and
        a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics.

Guidant
        makes a variety of implantable devices that can monitor the heart and deliver
        electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities, including tachycardia, heart
        failure
        and bradycardia. These devices include implantable

cardioverter

defibrillator
        systems (ICDs) and pacemaker systems. In addition, Guidant also makes cardiac
        surgery systems to perform cardiac surgical ablation, endoscopic vessel
        harvesting and clampless beating-heart bypass surgery.

Prior
        to
        our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott acquired Guidant’s vascular intervention and
        endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug-eluting
        technology it acquired from Guidant with Boston Scientific. This agreement
        gives
        us access to a second drug-eluting stent program, which will complement our
        existing TAXUS

stent
        system program. See

to our


[Table

        consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K
        for further details on the transaction.

We
        consolidated Guidant’s operating results with those of Boston Scientific
        beginning on the date of the acquisition, April 21, 2006. Since we have not
        restated our results retroactively to reflect the historical financial position
        or results of operations of Guidant, fluctuations in our operating results
        for
        2006 are due primarily to the acquisition of Guidant. However, we have included
        supplemental pro forma financial information in

Note D - Business Combinations

to our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K to give effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at
        the beginning of 2006 and 2005.

Executive
        Summary

Our
        net
        sales in 2006 increased to $7.821 billion from $6.283 billion in 2005.
        Our reported net loss for 2006 was $3.577 billion, or $2.81 per diluted
        share, on approximately 1.274 billion weighted average shares outstanding
        as
        compared to net income of $628 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, on
        approximately 838 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2005. Our
        reported results included net after-tax charges primarily related to the
        acquisition of Guidant of $4.537 billion, or $3.55 per diluted share, in
        2006 as compared to net after-tax charges of $894 million, or $1.07 per
        diluted share, in 2005.


In
        addition, our cash provided by operating activities was $1.845 billion in
        2006 as compared to $903 million in 2005.

The
        growth in net sales resulted largely from our acquisition of Guidant, which
        accounted for sales of $1.503 billion. The geographic mix of Guidant sales
        included $1.025 billion of U.S. and $478 million of international sales.
        The
        business mix of Guidant sales consisted of $1.371 billion of CRM net sales
        and
        $132 million of Cardiac Surgery net sales. Our CRM net sales were comprised
        of
        $988 million of ICDs and $383 million of pacemaker systems. On a pro forma
        basis, assuming a full year of results, CRM sales were $2.026 billion in
        2006 as
        compared to $2.28 billion in 2005. The decline, on a pro forma basis, was
        a
        result of lower average market shares for the Guidant devices in 2006 relative
        to 2005. We believe the lower market share, as well as reduced market growth
        rates, was due primarily to previous field actions in the industry. However,
        during the fourth

quarter
        of 2006, we experienced a 10 percent sequential increase in net sales from
        our
        CRM business and a 13 percent increase for U.S. ICD sales, which we believe
        is a
        sign that our market share has increased and the CRM market is stabilizing
        and will return to growth.

We
        remain
        focused on our share recovery.

The
        increase in our sales as a result of the acquisition of Guidant was partially
        offset by a decrease in TAXUS stent system sales to $2.358 billion in 2006
        from
        $2.556 billion in 2005. The geographic mix of TAXUS stent system sales in
        included $1.561 billion of U.S. and $797 million of international sales.
        In
        2005, we had $1.763 billion of U.S. and $793 million of international sales.
        The
        decline in TAXUS sales during 2006 was

attributable
        to a decrease in the U.S. market size due to recent uncertainty regarding
        the
        risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug-eluting stents and
        a
        decline in

_________________________

        The 2006 net after-tax charges consisted of: $4.477 billion in expenses
        resulting from purchase accounting associated primarily with purchased research
        and development obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition and the step-up
        value of acquired Guidant inventory sold; $143 million in acquisition-related
        costs, including the fair value adjustment related to the sharing of proceeds
        feature of the Abbott stock purchase, a CRM technology offering charge and
        other
        business integration costs; a $31 million credit resulting primarily from
        the
        reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the abdominal
        aortic aneurysm (AAA) program that we obtained as part of the TriVascular,
        Inc.
        acquisition; $81 million in write-downs attributable to our investment
        portfolio; and a $133 million one-time tax benefit for the reversal of tax
        accruals previously established for offshore unremitted earnings. The 2005
        net
        after-tax charges consisted of a $598 million litigation settlement with
        Medinol
        Ltd. and $267 million in purchased research and development attributable
        primarily to our 2005 acquisitions.

average
        market shares in 2006 relative to 2005. Late stent thrombosis is the formation
        of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after
        implantation of the stent. Exiting 2005, the percentage of drug-eluting stents
        used in U.S. interventional procedures were in the high 80 percent range,
        as
        compared to U.S. drug-eluting stent market penetration rates in the low 70
        percent range exiting 2006. Our U.S. drug-eluting stent market share
        declined throughout the first three quarters of 2005, but has been stable
        during
        2006 and we have maintained our market leadership position. W

e
        expect
        to launch our TAXUS Express


™

        system in the Japan market, which we believe exceeds $500 million, in the
        second
        half of 2007 and our TAXUS Liberté

™

stent
        system in
        the U.S., subject to regulatory approvals.

During
        2006, our worldwide Endosurgery group sales increased to $1.346 billion
        from $1.228 billion in 2005, an increase of 10 percent. Further, our
        Neuromodulation division, formed following the June 2004 acquisition of
        Advanced Bionics Corporation, generated $234 million in net sales during
        2006 as compared to $148 million in 2005, an increase of 58
        percent.

Our
        gross
        profit, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 77.9 percent in 2005
        to 71.8
        percent in 2006 largely as a result of certain one-time purchase accounting
        adjustments associated with the Guidant acquisition. In addition, our gross
        profit declined by approximately 2.0 percentage points due to period expenses,
        including costs associated with Project Horizon, a corporate-wide
        cross-functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality
        processes and systems. Our gross profit also declined by 0.8 percentage points
        due to shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products, including
        CRM products and lower sales of TAXUS stents in the U.S.

Our
        operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and
        litigation-related charges, increased $1.571 billion to $4.444 billion in
        from $2.873 billion in 2005. Of this increase, $1.299 billion related to
        operating expenses associated with the Guidant business. In the second half
        of
        2006, we maintained existing spending levels given our expectation that the
        CRM
        market and the drug-eluting stent market will recover over time and this
        infrastructure will be necessary to support future growth. In addition, we
        announced our plan to reallocate certain CRM resources, including those in
        the
        research and development and sales and marketing functions;

to
        increase innovation, productivity and competitiveness; and to enhance
        our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients.

This
        plan

resulted
        in a reduction of our CRM workforce by approximately 500 to 600 employees
        during the first quarter of 2007. We intend to reinvest the bulk of the savings
        from the plan back into the CRM business to create a strong, competitive
        pipeline that will help grow revenue that, combined with expense controls,
        should lead to increased profitability. The reinvestment will include additional
        hiring within the research and development function where there were shortages
        of desired skills.

We
        continue to be focused on examining our operations in order to identify cost
        improvement measures and reallocate resources to support growth
        initiatives.

At
        December 31, 2006, we had total outstanding debt of $8.902 billion, related
        primarily to the Guidant acquisition, cash of $1.668 billion and working
        capital
        of $2.271 billion. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow during
        2006. W

e
        expect
        to use a portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt
        obligations over the next several years;

our

first
        upcoming debt maturity is in April 2008 for $650 million.

FDA
        Warning Letters

On
        January 26, 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning
        letter from the FDA, notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three
        facilities and advising us that our corrective action plan relating to three
        site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As stated
        in
        this FDA warning letter, the FDA may not grant our requests for exportation
        certificates to foreign governments or approve pre-market approval (PMA)
        applications for class III devices to which the quality control or current
        good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably
        related until the deficiencies have been corrected. During 2005, in order
        to
        strengthen our corporate-wide quality controls, we launched Project
        Horizon

,
        a
        corporate-wide cross-functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall
        quality processes and systems. As part of Project Horizon, we have
        made

modifications
        to our process validation and complaint management systems. Pr

oject
        Horizon has resulted in the reallocation of significant internal
        engineering and management resources to quality initiatives, as well as
        incremental spending. It also has resulted in adjustments to product launch
        schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other
        product lines over time.

In
        2006,
        our Board of Directors created a Compliance and Quality Committee to monitor
        our
        compliance and quality initiatives. We believe we have identified solutions
        to
        the quality issues cited by the FDA, and we continue to make progress in
        transitioning our organization to implement those solutions. We communicate
        frequently and meet regularly with the FDA to apprise them of our progress.
        The
        FDA has communicated the need for us to complete substantially all remediation
        efforts before they will reinspect our facilities. We have engaged a third
        party
        to audit our enhanced quality systems in order to assess our corporate-wide
        compliance prior to reinspection by the FDA. We believe we will be ready
        for the
        third-party audit in the second quarter of 2007.

On
        December 23, 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing certain
        deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and
        record-keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. This
        FDA
        warning letter followed an inspection by the FDA that was completed on
        September 1, 2005 and cited a number of observations. Guidant received a
        follow-up letter from the FDA dated January 5, 2006. As stated in this
        follow-up letter, until we have corrected the identified deficiencies, the
        FDA
        may not grant requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments
        or
        approve PMA applications for class III devices to which the deficiencies
        described are reasonably related. The FDA conducted a further inspection
        of the
        CRM facility between December 15, 2005 and February 9, 2006 and made
        one additional inspectional observation.

The
        FDA
        has concluded its reinspection of our CRM facilities. While we believe this
        reinspection went well, we may be required to take additional actions in
        order
        to comply with any FDA observations that we may receive.

Outlook

Guidant
        Acquisition

On
        April
        21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant. With t

his
        acquisition, we have become a major provider in the more than $9 billion
        global
        CRM business, enhancing our overall competitive position and long-term growth
        potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. The acquisition
        has
        established us as one of the world’s largest cardiovascular device companies and
        a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics.

The
        integration of Guidant’s operations and product lines with Boston Scientific’s
        is complex and time-consuming, and the separation of the Guidant businesses
        required by the Abbott transaction adds complexity to the transition process.
        We
        have entered transition services agreements with Abbott, under which Abbott
        and
        Boston Scientific provide or make available to each other certain services,
        rights, properties and assets for a temporary period. Many of these transition
        services agreements expire during 2007. The failure to integrate Boston
        Scientific and Guidant successfully and to manage the challenges presented
        by
        the transition process effectively, including the retention of key Guidant
        personnel and the


[Table
            of Contents]

timely
        execution of activities under the transition services agreement, may reduce
        the
        anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition.

During
        2007, we will continue to incur integration and restructuring costs as we
        integrate certain operations of Guidant.

In
        January 2007, we announced our plan to reallocate certain CRM resources,
        including those in research and development as well as sales and marketing
        functions,

to
        increase innovation, productivity and competitiveness, and to enhance
        our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients.

This
        plan

resulted
        in a reduction of our CRM workforce by approximately 500 to 600 employees
        during the first quarter of 2007. There can be no assurances that we will
        realize efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses sufficient
        to
        offset incremental transaction, acquisition-related, integration and
        restructuring costs over time.

Net
        sales
        from our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses were $1.503 billion for 2006,
        including $1.371 billion of CRM sales and $132 million of Cardiac Surgery
        sales.
        On a pro forma basis, assuming a full year of results, CRM sales were $2.026
        billion in 2006 as compared to $2.28 billion in 2005.

The
        decline, on a pro forma basis, was a result of lower average market shares
        for
        the Guidant devices in 2006 relative to 2005. We believe the lower market
        share,
        as well as reduced market growth rates, was due primarily to previous field
        actions in the industry.

These
        field actions included Guidant’s decision announced on June 24, 2005 to
        stop selling Guidant’s leading defibrillator systems temporarily, which were
        returned to the market beginning on August 2, 2005. In addition, on June
        26, 2006, we announced that we were retrieving a specific subset of pacemakers,
        cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers and ICDs due to a supplier’s
        low-voltage capacitor not performing consistently. We believe that these
        field
        actions contributed to our CRM division having a lower market share for ICDs
        and
        pacemaker systems for 2006 as compared to 2005.

The
        worldwide CRM market growth rates, including the U.S. defibrillator market,
        declined during the first three quarters of 2006; these growth levels are
        below
        those experienced in recent years. The U.S. defibrillator market represents
        approximately half of the worldwide CRM market. During the fourth quarter
        of
        2006, we experienced a 10 percent sequential increase in net sales from our
        CRM
        business and a 13 percent increase for U.S. ICD sales, which we believe is
        a
        sign that our market share has increased and the CRM market is stabilizing
        and will return to growth. We expect that growth rates in the worldwide CRM
        market, and the U.S. ICD market, will recover over several years. However,
        there
        can be no assurance that these markets will return to their historical
        growth rates or that we will be able to regain CRM market share or increase
        net
        sales in a timely manner, if at all. The most significant variables that
        may
        impact the size of the CRM market and our position within this market
        include:

future
              product recalls or new physician advisories by us or our
              competitors;

our
              ability to resolve the issues identified in the CRM warning letter
              to the
              satisfaction of the FDA;

variations
                in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and
                our
                competitors’ products;

our
                  ability to retain our sales force and other key
                  personnel;

our
                    ability to reestablish the trust and confidence of the implanting
                    community,
                    the referring community and prospective patients in our
                    technology;

delayed
                      or limited regulatory
                      approvals;


[Table
            of Contents]

our
                ability to launch next-generation products and technology features
                in a timely
                manner, if at all;

international
                  economic and regulatory conditions;

new
                    competitive launches;

unfavorable
                      reimbursement policies;

declines
                        in average selling prices;

the
                          overall number of procedures performed; and

the
                            outcome of legal proceedings related to our CRM
                            business.

We
        remain
        focused on our market share recovery and intend to accelerate recovery by

regaining
        the trust and confidence of the implanting community, the referring community
        and prospective patients; continuing to improve our quality systems; investing
        in new technologies and clinical trials; retaining our sales force and other
        key
        personnel; continuing research and development productivity; and improving
        physician and patient communication. However, if these efforts are not
        successful, and the CRM market does not recover according to our expectations,
        or we are unable to regain market share and net sales on a timely basis,
        our
        business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
        adversely affected.

Coronary
        Stent Business

Coronary
        stent revenue represented approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net
        sales
        for 2006, as compared to 43 percent in 2005, primarily as a result of the
        Guidant acquisition. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market
        approximated $6 billion in 2006, and estimate that drug-eluting stents
        represented approximately 90 percent of the dollar value of the worldwide
        coronary stent market in 2006. The U.S. drug-eluting stent market for 2006
        approximated $3 billion. Our U.S. TAXUS sales declined

to
        $1.561
        billion for 2006 as compared to $1.763 billion for 2005

.
        Recent
        uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use
        of
        drug-eluting stents contributed to a decline in the U.S. stent market size.
        In
        addition to the decline in U.S. drug-eluting stent market penetration, device
        utilization per procedure and overall percutaneous coronary intervention
        volume
        has decreased likely due to market conservatism. We believe this conservatism
        is
        a temporary circumstance that, if alleviated, may lead to an increase in
        future
        procedural volume and usage of drug-eluting stents. In the fourth quarter
        of
        2006, the FDA held a special ad

visory
        panel meeting to discuss drug-eluting stents. Members of the panel concluded
        that drug-eluting stents remain safe and effective when used as indicated,
        and
        that the benefits outweigh the risks.

We
        believe that percutaneous coronary interventions, device utilization per
        procedure and drug-eluting stent penetration rates will increase in the future,
        and result in a market recovery; however, there can be no assurance that
        this
        will happen or that the market will recover to previous levels. We expect
        that
        our U.S. drug-eluting stent sales in 2007 may be below those experienced
        in
        2006.

During
        2006, our international TAXUS stent system net sales remained consistent
        with
        2005.

Drug-eluting
        stent penetration rates increased

during
        the first half of 2006, and remained relatively flat throughout the second
        half
        of 2006 and exiting 2006, the effect of which

offset
        declines in our market share associated with several competitive launches
        of new
        drug-eluting stent products in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets.
        We
        expect competitive launches in these geographies to continue to put pressure
        on
        our market share and average selling prices in 2007. In addition, we expect
        that
        drug-eluting stent penetration rates will remain relatively consistent in
        our
        Europe and Inter-Continental markets during 2007 due primarily to concerns
        regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis. Subject to regulatory


[Table
            of Contents]

approval,
        we expect to launch our TAXUS Express


stent
        system in Japan during the second half of 2007, where we estimate a drug-eluting
        stent market size exceeding $500 million.

Historically,
        the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive
        with
        significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course
        of our
        business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety
        of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or
        inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted
        by
        us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market’s perception of this
        clinical data, may adversely impact our position in and share of the
        drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the
        market.

However,
        we believe that we can maintain a leadership position within the drug-eluting
        stent markets in which we compete for a variety of reasons,
        including:

the
            results of our TAXUS clinical
            trials;

the
            performance benefits of our current
            technology;

the
              strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products and the planned
              launch
              sequence of these products;

our
              overall market leadership in interventional
              medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales
              force;

our
              significant investments in our sales, clinical,
              marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and

our
                second drug-eluting stent platform obtained as a result of our Guidant
                acquisition.

However,
            a material decline in our drug-eluting stent
            revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating
            results.
            The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting
            coronary stent market and our position within this market
            include:

continued
              concerns regarding the risk of late stent
              thrombosis;

the
                entry of additional competitors in international markets and the
                U.S.;

continued
                  physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes
                  toward
                  drug-eluting stents;

our
                    ability to resolve the issues identified in the current legacy
                    Boston
                    Scientific corporate warning letter to the satisfaction of the
                    FDA;

declines
                      in the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent
                      systems;

variations
                        in clinical results or product performance of our and our
                        competitors’
                        products;

delayed
                          or limited regulatory approvals;

the
                            overall number of procedures performed;

unfavorable
                              reimbursement
                              policies;

intellectual
              property litigation;

the
                average number of stents used per procedure;

our
                  ability to maintain and expand indications for use;

our
                    ability to launch next-generation products and technology
                    features;

the
                      international adoption rate of drug-eluting stent
                      technology;

international
                        economic and regulatory conditions; and

the
                          level of supply of our drug-eluting stent systems and competitive
                          stent
                          systems.

The
        TAXUS
        drug-eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug-eluting products
        in
        the U.S. market. Our share of the drug-eluting stent market, as well as unit
        prices, may be adversely impacted as additional significant competitors enter
        the drug-eluting stent market, which could occur as early as the second half
        of
        2007 in the U.S.

Prior
        to
        our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott acquired Guidant’s vascular intervention and
        endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug-eluting
        technology it acquired from Guidant with Boston Scientific, including the
        XIENCE™ V everolimus-eluting coronary stent system. In October of 2006, we
        received CE mark approval to begin marketing the PROMUS™

stent
        system, which is a private-labeled XIENCE V drug-eluting coronary stent system
        supplied to us by Abbott. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we initiated
        a
        limited launch of the PROMUS stent system in certain European countries.
        We
        expect to launch the PROMUS stent system in certain Inter-Continental countries
        in the second quarter of 2007 and in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory
        approval. Under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the profit
        margin of a PROMUS stent system will be significantly lower than our TAXUS
        drug-eluting stent. Therefore, the mix of PROMUS stent system revenue relative
        to our total drug-eluting stent revenue could have a negative impact on our
        overall profitability as a percentage of revenue. In addition, we will incur
        incremental costs and expend incremental resources in order to develop and
        commercialize products utilizing the Guidant drug-eluting stent system
        technology and to support the launch of our internally manufactured
        everolimus-eluting stent system in the future, which we expect will have
        profit
        margins more comparable to our TAXUS stent system.

Regulatory
        Compliance

In
        January 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter
        from
        the FDA, notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities.
        During 2005, in order to strengthen our corporate-wide quality controls,
        we
        launched Project Horizon, which has resulted in the reallocation of significant
        internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives, as
        well as incremental spending. It also has resulted in adjustments to product
        launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain
        other product lines over time. See the

FDA
        Warning Letters

section
        above for further information regarding the FDA warning letters.

There
        can
        be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to
        resolve
        these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA. Our inability to resolve these
        issues in a timely manner may further delay product launch schedules, including
        the U.S. launch of our TAXUS Liberté stent, which may weaken our competitive
        position in the markets in which we participate. If our remedial actions
        are not
        satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional financial and human
        resources to our efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions
        against us, including, but not limited to, seizing our product inventory,


[Table
            of Contents]

obtaining
        a court injunction against further marketing of our products, issuing a consent
        decree or assessing civil monetary penalties.

Intellectual
        Property Litigation

There
        continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary
        stent market. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings
        with
        our existing competitors, including Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, Inc.
        There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these
        proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market.
        See

Note
        J - Commitments and Contingencies

to
        our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K

for a
        description of these legal proceedings.

Innovation

Our
        approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies
        with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and
        alliances. Our research and development program is largely focused on the
        development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple
        programs and divisions.

As
        a
        result of our agreement with Abbott, we now have access to a second drug-eluting
        stent program, which will complement our existing TAXUS

stent
        system program.

We
        expect
        to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug-eluting stent program, along
        with
        our internally manufactured everolimus-eluting stent program, to continue
        to
        sustain our worldwide drug-eluting stent market leadership position. During
        2007, we expect to incur incremental capital expenditures and research and
        development expenses as a result of our dual drug-eluting stent program.
        We
        successfully launched our next-generation drug-eluting stent product, the
        TAXUS
        Liberté stent system, during 2005 in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets.
        We expect to launch our TAXUS Liberté stent system in the U.S., subject to
        regulatory approval. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our
        CRM
        technologies, including our LATITUDE

®

Patient
        Management System,

which
        is
        technology that enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely
        while
        patients remain in their homes,

and
        the
        Frontier

™

CRM
        technology, our

next-generation pulse generator platform

.

In
        October 2006, the FDA approved expansion of our LATITUDE System to be used
        for
        remote monitoring in certain existing ICDs and cardiac resynchronization
        defibrillators.

We also
        expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug-eluting stent and CRM
        technologies. There can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve
        technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance.
        A delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely
        impact our future growth.

Our
        acquisitions and alliances are intended to expand further our ability to
        offer
        our customers effective, high-quality medical devices that satisfy their
        interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to
        integrate acquired businesses. However, our failure to integrate these
        businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic
        and
        financial objectives of these transactions. Potential future acquisitions,
        including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options
        to purchase, or the fulfillment of our contingent consideration obligations
        may
        be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing,
        depending on their size and nature. Further, in connection with these
        acquisitions and other strategic alliances, we have acquired numerous in-process
        research and development projects. As we continue to undertake strategic
        growth
        initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional
        in-process research and development projects.

In
        addition, we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with
        privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve
        equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company
        or
        assets of the other company in the future. We enter these strategic alliances
        to
        broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our
        reach
        into existing and new markets. The success of these alliances is an element
        of
        our growth strategy and we will continue to seek


[Table
            of Contents]

market
        opportunities and growth through selective strategic alliances and
        acquisitions. However, the full benefit of these alliances is often
        dependent on the strength of the other companies’ underlying technology and
        ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch
        competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies,
        among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these
        alliances.

Even
        though we believe that the drug-eluting stent market and CRM market will
        recover
        above existing levels, there can be no assurance to the timing or extent
        of this
        recovery. In 2007, we will continue to reprioritize our internal research
        and
        development project portfolio and our external investment portfolio
        primarily based on expectations of future market growth. This reprioritization
        may result in our decision to sell, discontinue, write-down, or otherwise
        reduce the funding of certain projects, operations, investments or assets.
        Any proceeds from sales, or any increases in operating cash flows, resulting
        from such management actions may be used to reduce debt or may be reinvested
        in
        other research and development projects or other operational
        initiatives.

Reimbursement
        and Funding

Our
        products are purchased by hospitals, doctors and other healthcare providers
        who
        are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g.,
        Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed-care programs,
        for
        the healthcare services provided to their patients. Third-party payors may
        provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures
        based on assessment criteria as determined by the third-party payor.
        Reimbursement by third-party payors for these services is based on a wide
        range
        of methodologies that may reflect the services’ assessed resource costs,
        clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer
        different, and often conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives
        to
        healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies are subject to
        frequent refinements. There is no way of predicting the outcome
        of reimbursement decisions, or their impact on our operating results.
        Third-party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and
        challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can
        be
        no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third-party
        payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the
        third-party payors’ coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to
        sell our products profitably.

International
        Markets

International
        markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement
        levels and healthcare costs. Our sales growth and profitability from our
        international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related
        to
        economic conditions in these regions, currency fluctuations, regulatory and
        reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development,
        rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall
        business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political,
        regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international
        operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition
        or
        results of operations.

In
        addition, we are required to receive or renew regulatory approvals and obtain
        exportation certificates to foreign governments in order to market our products
        in certain international jurisdictions. These approvals and certificates
        could
        be impacted by the FDA warning letters we have received. If these approvals
        and
        certificates are not renewed or obtained on a timely basis, our ability to
        market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may
        be
        limited, which could have a material adverse impact on our
        business.

        using constant currency exchange rates.

U.S.
        Net Sales

In
        2006,
        our U.S. net sales increased by $988 million, or 26 percent, as compared to
        2005. The increase is related primarily to the inclusion of $1.025 billion
        of
        U.S. net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions. In addition,
        we
        experienced increases in our U.S. net sales related to sales growth of
        $83 million from our Endosurgery group and $75 million from our
        Neuromodulation division. Offsetting this increase were declines in our U.S.
        net
        sales of TAXUS coronary stent systems to $1.561 billion for 2006 as compared
        to
        $1.763 billion for 2005 and sales decreases of approximately $70 million
        in 2006
        as compared to 2005 due to the expiration during the first quarter of 2006
        of
        our agreement to distribute certain third-party guidewire and sheath products.
        The decline in TAXUS sales was due principally to a decrease in the U.S.
        drug-eluting stent market size and a decline in average TAXUS market share
        in
        2006 relative to 2005. The drug-eluting stent market decline was due to recent
        uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use
        of
        drug-eluting stents, which resulted in conservative usage by physicians.
        The
        overall size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market is driven primarily by
        the
        number of percutaneous coronary interventional procedures performed; the
        number
        of devices used per procedure; the drug-eluting stent penetration rate or
        mix
        between bare metal and drug-eluting stents across procedures; and average
        drug-eluting stent selling prices. The primary reason for the decline in
        the
        U.S. drug-eluting stent market size was lower penetration rates in 2006 relative
        to 2005.

Exiting
        2005, the percentage of drug-eluting stents used in U.S. interventional
        procedures were in the high 80 percent range, as compared to U.S. drug-eluting
        stent market penetration rates in the low 70 percent range exiting
        2006. The drug-eluting stent market also declined due to decreases in the
        number of devices used per procedure and slight

reductions
        in average selling prices.

Our
        drug-eluting stent market share declined throughout the first three quarters
        of
        2005, but has been stable during 2006.

See
        the

Outlook

section
        for a more detailed discussion of the drug-eluting stent market and our position
        within that market.

In
        2005,
        our U.S. net sales increased by $350 million, or 10 percent, as compared to
        2004. The increase resulted largely from a full year of TAXUS stent system
        sales, which we launched in March 2004. U.S. TAXUS stent system sales for
        were $1.763 billion as compared to $1.57 billion for 2004, offset by a reduction
        in market share compared to the prior year. The remainder of the increase
        in our
        U.S. net sales related to sales growth of $83 million from our Endosurgery
        group and $75 million from our Neuromodulation division.

International
        Net Sales

In
        2006,
        our international net sales increased by $550 million, or 23 percent,
        as compared to 2005. The increase related primarily to the inclusion of $478
        million of international net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery
        divisions. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets
        was due
        to growth in various product franchises, including $35 million in net sales
        from
        our Endosurgery group and $27 million in sales growth from our Neurovascular
        division. TAXUS stent system sales in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets
        were $797 million in 2006 as compared to $793 million in 2005. TAXUS stent
        system sales were favorably impacted by drug-eluting stent penetration rates
        in
        these markets. The drug-eluting stent penetration rates increased during
        the
        first half of 2006, and remained relatively flat throughout the second half
        of
        2006 and exiting 2006. Market share declines associated with several competitors
        having launched new drug-eluting stent products in these markets offset the
        favorable impact of increased penetration rates.

In
        2006,
        our legacy Boston Scientific net sales in Japan, excluding the impact of
        currency fluctuations, were relatively consistent with the prior year. Due
        to
        the timing of regulatory approval for our TAXUS stent system and
        government-mandated pricing reductions for other products, we do not expect
        significant revenue growth in our legacy Japan business until we launch our
        TAXUS Express


stent
        system in Japan,


[Table
            of Contents]

which
        we
        expect to occur during the second half of 2007. Japan net sales for 2006
        included $62 million from CRM and Cardiac Surgery products.

In
        2005,
        our international net sales increased by $309 million, or 15 percent,
        as compared to 2004. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our
        TAXUS
        stent system by $220 million, or 38 percent, in our Europe and
        Inter-Continental markets. This increase in TAXUS stent system sales in these
        markets was primarily the result of increased market penetration rates, as
        well
        as the successful launch of our TAXUS Liberté stent system during 2005. The
        remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth
        in
        various product franchises, including $57 million in incremental sales from
        our Endosurgery group and $27 million in sales growth from our
        Neuromodulation division.

In
        2006,
        our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 6.1 percentage
        points as compared to 2005. Our gross profit for 2006 decreased as a percentage
        of net sales by 3.8 percentage points as compared to 2005 due to costs
        associated with Guidant, including $267 million in step-up value of
        acquired Guidant inventory sold during the period and a $31 million charge
        associated with making our LATITUDE Patient Management System available to
        many
        of our existing CRM patients without additional charge. In connection with
        the
        accounting for the Guidant acquisition, we wrote up inventory acquired from
        manufacturing cost to fair value. As of December 31, 2006, we had no inventory
        step-up value remaining in inventory. In addition, our gross profit for 2006
        decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately 2.0 percentage points
        as
        compared to 2005 due to period expenses, including costs associated with
        Project
        Horizon and certain inventory charges. Shifts in our product sales mix toward
        lower margin products, including CRM products and lower sales of TAXUS stents
        in
        the U.S., decreased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.8
        percentage points. These decreases were offset by a 0.8 percentage point
        increase due to the favorable change in currency exchange rates on our gross
        profit.

In
        2005,
        our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 0.9 percentage
        points as compared to 2004. Our 2004 gross profit decreased by approximately
        1.0
        percentage points due to $57 million in inventory write-downs, including a
        $43 million write-down attributable to recalls of certain of our coronary
        stent systems and a $14 million write-down of TAXUS stent inventory due to
        shelf-life dating. In addition, shifts in our product sales mix toward higher
        margin products, primarily TAXUS stents, increased our gross profit as a
        percentage of net sales by 0.6 percentage points. Our gross profit for 2005
        was reduced as a percentage of net sales by 0.9 percentage points related
        to period expenses, including manufacturing start-up costs primarily associated
        with our TAXUS Liberté stent system and increased investment in quality
        initiatives. The remaining fluctuation in gross profit as a percentage of
        net
        sales primarily related to the favorable change in currency exchange rates.

Operating
        Expenses

Our
        operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and
        litigation-related charges, increased $1.571 billion to $4.444 billion in
        from $2.873 billion in 2005. Of this increase, $1.299 billion related to
        operating expenses associated with the Guidant business. The significant
        increase in


[Table
            of Contents]

each
        of
        our operating expense categories is primarily a result of Guidant operating
        expenses. The following table provides a summary of our operating expenses,
        excluding purchased research and development and litigation-related
        charges:

Selling,
        General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses

In
        2006,
        our SG&A expenses increased by $861 million, or 47 percent, as compared
        to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses increased to
        34.2 percent in 2006 from 28.9 percent for the same period in the
        prior year. The increase in our SG&A expenses related primarily to: $670
        million in expenditures associated with Guidant; $65 million of
        acquisition-related costs associated primarily with certain Guidant
        integration and retention programs; increases of $63 million due primarily
        to
        increased headcount attributable to the expansion of our sales force within
        our
        international regions and Neuromodulation division; and $55 million in
        incremental stock-based compensation expense associated with the adoption
        of
        Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based
        Payment

Critical
        Accounting Policies

section
        and

Note
        L - Stock Ownership Plans

for
        a
        more detailed discussion of Statement No. 123(R). SG&A expenses for 2005
        included $21 million in costs related to certain business optimization
        initiatives and $17 million in costs related to certain retirement
        benefits.

In
        2005,
        our SG&A expenses increased by $72 million, or four percent, as
        compared to 2004. The increase primarily related to: approximately
        $100 million in increased headcount and higher compensation expense mainly
        attributable to the expansion of the sales force within our Interventional
        Cardiology business unit and Endosurgery group and costs related to market
        development initiatives; $75 million in incremental operating expenses
        associated with our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily

Advanced
        Bionics; $21 million in costs related to certain business optimization
        initiatives; $19 million in stock-based compensation expense associated
        primarily with the issuance of deferred stock units in 2005; and
        $17 million in costs related to certain retirement benefits. Certain
        charges incurred in 2004 partially offset these increases, including a
        $110 million enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, and a $90 million
        non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option
        plans.
        As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to
        28.9 percent in 2005 from 31.0 percent in 2004 primarily due to the
        increase in our net sales in 2005.

Research
        and Development (R&D) Expenses

Our
        investment in R&D reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical
        research as well as new product development programs. In 2006, our R&D
        expenses increased by $328 million, or 48 percent, as compared to
        2005. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses increased to
        12.9 percent in 2006 from 10.8 percent in 2005. The increase primarily
        related to:

the
        inclusion of $270 million in expenditures associated with Guidant;
        approximately $30 million in costs related to the cancellation of the
        TriVascular AAA program; $24 million of stock-based compensation expense
        associated with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R); and $13 million of
        acquisition-related costs associated with certain Guidant


[Table
            of Contents]

integration
        and retention programs. See the

Purchased Research and Development

section
        for further discussion regarding the cancellation of our TriVascular AAA
        stent-graft program.

In
        2005,
        our R&D expenses increased by $111 million, or 20 percent, as compared
        to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses increased to 10.8
        percent in 2005 from 10.1 percent in 2004. The increase related primarily
        to an
        increased investment of approximately $60 million in incremental R&D
        expense attributable to our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced
        Bionics and TriVascular. In addition, we increased spending on internal R&D
        projects within our Endosurgery group by $25 million.

Royalty
        Expense

In
        2006,
        our royalty expense increased by $4 million, or 2 percent, as compared
        to 2005. The increase was due to $25 million of royalty expense associated
        with
        the CRM and Cardiac Surgery products that we acquired as part of the Guidant
        acquisition. This increase was offset by a decrease in royalty expense
        attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system by $20 million to $153
        million for 2006 as compared to the prior year due primarily to lower sales
        volume. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense decreased to
        3.0 percent in 2006 from 3.6 percent in 2005. This decrease was primarily a
        result of the inclusion of net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery
        products, which on average have a lower royalty cost relative to legacy Boston
        Scientific net sales.

In
        2005,
        our royalty expense increased by $32 million, or 16 percent, as
        compared to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased
        to
        3.6 percent in 2005 from 3.5 percent in 2004. The increase in our
        royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty-bearing products, primarily
        sales of our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of
        our
        TAXUS stent system increased by $27 million to $174 million for 2005
        as compared to 2004.

Amortization
        Expense

In
        2006,
        our amortization expense increased by $378 million, or 249 percent, as
        compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense
        increased to 6.8 percent in 2006 from 2.4 percent in 2005.

The
        increase in our amortization expense related primarily to: $334 million of
        amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition;
        $23 million for the write-off of intangible assets due to the cancellation
        of
        the TriVascular AAA program; $21 million for the write-off of the intangible
        assets associated with developed technology obtained as part of our 2005
        acquisition of Rubicon Medical Corporation; and $12 million for the write-off
        of
        the intangible assets associated with our Real-time Position Management System
        (RPM) technology, a discontinued technology platform obtained as part of
        our
        acquisition of Cardiac Pathways Corporation. The write-off of the RPM intangible
        assets resulted from our decision to cease investment in the technology.
        The
        write-off of the Rubicon developed technology resulted from our decision
        to
        redesign the first generation of the technology and concentrate resources
        on the
        development and commercialization of the next-generation product. We do not
        expect these program cancellations and related write-offs to impact our future
        operations or cash flows materially. Amortization expense for 2005 included
        a
        $10 million write-off of intangible assets related to our

Enteryx

®

Liquid Polymer Technology, a discontinued technology platform obtained as
        a part
        of our acquisition of Enteric Medical Technologies, Inc.. The write-off
        resulted from our decision during 2005 to cease selling the Enteryx
        product.

In
        2005,
        our amortization expense increased by $40 million, or 36 percent, as
        compared to 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense
        increased to 2.4 percent in 2005 from 2.0 percent in 2004. The
        increase in our amortization expense was due primarily to $25 million in
        incremental amortization expense from the intangible assets obtained in
        conjunction with our 2004 and 2005


[Table
            of Contents]

acquisitions,
        primarily Advanced Bionics. In addition, amortization expense included a
        $10 million write-off of intangible assets related to Enteryx.

Interest
        Expense

Our
        interest expense increased to $435 million in 2006 as compared to $90 million
        in
        2005. The increase in our interest expense related primarily to an increase
        in
        our average debt levels used to finance the Guidant acquisition, as well
        as an
        increase in our weighted-average borrowing cost. Our average debt levels
        for
        2006 increased to approximately $7.2 billion as compared to approximately
        $2.4
        billion for 2005. Our weighted-average borrowing cost for 2006 increased
        to

6.1
        percent from 3.8 percent for 2005. At December 31, 2006, $5.886 billion, or
        81 percent, of our approximately $7.234 billion in outstanding net debt is
        at fixed interest rates.

Our
        interest expense increased to $90 million in 2005 from $64 million in
        2004. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to an increase
        in average market interest rates on our borrowings.

Fair
        Value Adjustment

During
        2006, we recorded net expense of $95 million to reflect the change in fair
        value
        related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase,
        which
        is discussed in further detail at

Note D- Business Combinations

to
        our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K

.

This
        sharing of proceeds feature is being marked-to-market through earnings based
        upon changes in our stock price, among other factors.

Other,
        net

Our
        other, net reflected expense of $56 million in 2006, income of $13 million
        in 2005 and expense of $16 million in 2004. Our other, net included
        investment write-downs of $121 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005 and
        $58 million in 2004, in each case attributable to an other-than-temporary
        decline in fair value of certain strategic alliances. These write-downs were
        partially offset by realized gains on investments of $9 million in 2006,
        $4
        million in 2005 and $36 million in 2004.

Our
        write-downs during 2006 included charges of $34 million associated with
        investment write-downs due primarily to the termination of a gene therapy
        trial
        being conducted by one of our portfolio companies. In addition, we recorded
        $27
        million of investment write-downs related to one of our vascular sealing
        portfolio companies due to continued delays in its technology development
        and
        the resulting deterioration in its financial condition. The remaining investment
        write-downs were not individually significant. We do not expect these
        write-downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially.

In
        addition, our other, net included interest income of $67 million in 2006,
        $36 million in 2005 and $20 million in 2004. Our interest income
        increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due primarily to increases in our cash
        and
        cash equivalents balances and increases in average market interest rates.
        Our
        interest income in 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due to increases in
        average market interest rates.

            of Contents]

Tax
        Rate

The
        following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:

In
        2006,
        the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to 2005 related primarily
        to
        the impact of certain charges during 2006 that are taxed at different rates
        than
        our effective tax rate. These charges include: purchased research and
        development; asset write-downs; reversal of taxes associated with unremitted
        earnings; and tax gain on the sale of intangible assets.

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, we had recorded a $133 million deferred tax liability
        for
        unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we had anticipated
        repatriating in the foreseeable future. During 2006, we made a significant
        acquisition that, when combined with certain changes in business conditions
        subsequent to the acquisition, resulted in a reevaluation of this liability.
        We
        have determined that we will not repatriate these earnings in the foreseeable
        future and, instead, we will indefinitely reinvest these earnings in foreign
        operations to repay debt obligations associated with the acquisition. As
        a
        result, we reversed the deferred tax liability and reduced income tax expense
        by
        $133 million in 2006.

We
        currently estimate that our 2007 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges,
        will be approximately 21 percent due primarily to our intention to reinvest
        offshore substantially all of our offshore earnings. However, acquisitions
        or
        dispositions in 2007 and geographic changes in the manufacture of our products
        may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate.

In
        2005,
        the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2004 related primarily
        to
        the impact of certain charges during 2005 that are taxed at different rates
        than
        our effective tax rate. These

charges
        include: certain litigation-related charges; purchased research and development;
        asset write-downs and employee-related costs that resulted from certain business
        optimization initiatives; costs related to certain retirement benefits; and
        a
        tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American
        Jobs
        Creation Act.

Litigation-Related
        Charges

In
        2005,
        we recorded a $780 million pre-tax charge associated with the Medinol
        litigation settlement. On September 21, 2005, we reached a settlement with
        Medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation. In
        conjunction with the settlement agreement, we paid $750 million in cash and
        cancelled our equity investment in Medinol.

In
        2004,
        we recorded a $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory
        matters, which included a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice,
        which we paid in 2005.

        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K.

Purchased
        Research and Development

During
        2006, we recorded $4.119 billion of purchased research and development. This
        amount included a charge of approximately $4.169 billion associated with
        the
        purchased research and development obtained


[Table
            of Contents]

in
        conjunction with the Guidant acquisition; a credit of approximately $67 million
        resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due
        to the
        cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; and an expense of approximately
        $17
        million resulting primarily from the application of equity method accounting
        for
        our investment in EndoTex Interventional Systems.

The
        $4.169 billion of purchased research and development associated with the
        Guidant
        acquisition consists primarily of approximately $3.26 billion for acquired
        CRM-related products and approximately $540 million for drug-eluting stent
        technology shared with Abbott. The purchased research and development value
        associated with the Guidant acquisition also includes approximately $369
        million
        that represents the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments
        of
        up to $500 million that we may receive from Abbott upon receipt of certain
        regulatory approvals by the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions
        businesses it acquired from Guidant. We recorded the amounts as purchased
        research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the
        payments is dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory
        approvals, and the asset has no alternative future use as of the acquisition
        date.

The
        most
        significant purchased research and development projects acquired from Guidant
        include the Frontier CRM technology

and
        rights to the everolimus-eluting stent technology that we share with Abbott.
        The
        Frontier CRM technology represents Guidant’s next-generation pulse
        generator platform that will incorporate new components and software while
        leveraging certain existing intellectual property, technology, manufacturing
        know-how and institutional knowledge of Guidant. We expect to leverage this
        platform across all CRM product lines to treat electrical dysfunction in
        the
        heart. We expect to launch various Frontier-based products commercially in
        the
        U.S. over the next 36 months, subject to regulatory approval. As of
        December 31, 2006, we estimate that the total costs to complete the Frontier
        CRM
        technology is between $150 million and $200 million. We expect material cash
        inflows from Frontier-based products to commence in 2008.

The
        $540
        million attributable to the everolimus-eluting stent technology represents
        the
        estimated fair value of the rights to Guidant’s everolimus-based drug-eluting
        stent technology we share with Abbott. In December 2006, we launched PROMUS,
        our
        first-generation everolimus-based stent, supplied by Abbott, in limited
        quantities in Europe. We expect to launch a first-generation everolimus-eluting
        stent, supplied by Abbott, in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory approval.
        We expect to launch an internally manufactured next-generation everolimus-based
        stent in Europe in 2010 and in the U.S. in 2011. We expect that material
        net
        cash inflows (net of operating costs, including research and development
        costs
        to complete) from our internally manufactured everolimus-based drug-eluting
        stent will commence in 2010 or 2011, following its approval in Europe and
        in the
        U.S. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that the cost to complete the
        next-generation everolimus-eluting stent technology project is between $200
        million and $250 million. The in-process projects acquired in conjunction
        with
        the Guidant acquisition are generally progressing in line with our estimates
        as
        of the acquisition date.

In
        2005,
        we recorded $276 million of purchased research and development. Our 2005
        purchased research and development consisted of: $130 million relating to
        our
        acquisition of TriVascular; $73 million relating to our acquisition of Advanced
        Stent Technologies, Inc. (AST); $45 million relating to our acquisition of
        Rubicon; and $3 million relating to our acquisition of CryoVascular Systems,
        Inc. In addition, we recorded $25 million of purchased research and development
        in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights for new brain monitoring
        technology that Aspect Medical Systems, one of our strategic partners, is
        currently developing. This technology is designed to aid the diagnosis and
        treatment of depression, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions.

The
        most
        significant 2005 purchased research and development projects included
        TriVascular’s AAA stent-graft and AST’s Petal™ bifurcation stent, which
        collectively represented 73 percent of our 2005


[Table
            of Contents]

purchased
        research and development. During the second quarter of 2006, management
        cancelled the TriVascular AAA stent-graft program. The program cancellation
        was
        due principally to forecasted increases in time and costs to complete the
        development of the stent-graft and to receive regulatory approval. We do
        not
        expect the program cancellation and related write-downs to impact our future
        operations or cash flows materially. The cancellation of the TriVascular
        AAA
        program resulted in the shutdown of our facility in Santa Rosa, California
        and
        the displacement of approximately 300 employees. During 2006, we recorded a
        charge to research and development expenses of approximately $20 million
        associated primarily with write-downs of fixed assets and a charge to research
        and development expenses of approximately $10 million associated with severance
        and related costs incurred in connection with the cancellation of the
        TriVascular AAA program. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge related
        to the remaining TriVascular intangible assets and reversed our accrual for
        contingent payments recorded in the initial purchase accounting. The effect
        of
        the write-off of these assets and liabilities was a $23 million charge to
        amortization expense and a $67 million credit to purchased research and
        development during the second quarter of 2006. We completed substantially
        the
        shutdown activities during the third quarter of 2006.

AST’s
        Petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel where
        a
        single vessel branches into two vessels, permitting blood to flow into both
        branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction. We estimate
        the remaining cost to complete the Petal bifurcation stent to be between
        $100 million and $125 million. We expect material net cash inflows
        from the Petal bifurcation stent to begin in 2011, which is when we expect
        the
        stent to be commercially available in the U.S. in a drug-eluting configuration.
        The AST Petal bifurcation stent in-process project is

generally
        progressing in line with our estimates as of the acquisition date.

In
        2004,
        we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004
        purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating
        to our acquisitions of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our
        acquisition of Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. The most significant in-process
        projects acquired in connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced
        Bionics’ bion

®

microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which
        collectively represented 77 percent of our 2004 acquired in-process
        projects’ value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation
        device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions. We estimate
        the
        remaining cost to complete the bion microstimulator for migraine headaches
        to be
        approximately $35 million. We expect material net cash inflows from the
        bion microstimulator to commence in 2011, following its approval in the U.S.,
        which we expect to occur in 2010. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery pump
        is an
        implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. We estimate
        the
        remaining cost to complete the drug delivery pump to be between $50 million
        and $60 million. We continue to assess the pace and risk of development of
        the drug delivery pump, as well as general market opportunities for the pump,
        which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval or lower
        potential market value. We currently expect material net cash inflows from
        the
        drug delivery pump to commence in 2012, following its approval in the U.S.,
        which we expect to occur in 2011 or 2012. The estimated timing and costs
        to
        complete the bion microstimulator and the drug delivery pump have increased
        relative to what we estimated as of the acquisition date; however, we do
        not
        believe these increases will have a material impact on our results of operations
        or financial condition.

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

The
        following tables provide a summary of key performance indicators that we
        use to
        assess our liquidity and operating performance:


[Table
            of Contents]

Management
        uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist
        users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our
        business over time. Users of our financial statements should consider this
        non-GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, or
        as
        superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our
        EBITDA
        included pre-tax charges of $4.715 billion in 2006, $1.112 billion in 2005
        and $340 million in 2004; see the

Executive
        Summary

section
        for a description of these charges.

Operating
        Activities

Cash
        generated by our operating activities continues to be a major source of funds
        for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth.
        The
        increase in cash generated by our operating activities in 2006 as compared
        to
        2005 is attributable primarily to significant one-time payments made during
        2005, consisting of: an approximate $75 million settlement payment made to
        the
        Department of Justice; a one-time $110 million 401(k) contribution; a cash
        settlement with Medinol of $750 million; and tax payments, including those
        associated with the American Jobs Creation Act. Cash paid for income taxes
        and
        interest was $423 million in 2006 and $437 million in 2005. We expect to
        make
        approximately $400 million in tax payments during the first quarter of 2007
        associated primarily with the gain on the sale of Guidant’s vascular
        intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott.

The
          following represents a reconciliation between EBITDA and net (loss) income:


[Table
            of Contents]

Investing
            Activities

We
        made
        capital expenditures of $341 million in 2006 and 2005. Capital expenditures
        in 2006 included $107 million associated with our CRM and Cardiac Surgery
        divisions. Legacy Boston Scientific capital expenditures declined in 2006
        compared to 2005 due to significant capital expenditures incurred in the
        prior
        year to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect
        to
        incur capital expenditures of approximately $450 million during 2007, which
        includes a full year of capital expenditures for our CRM and Cardiac Surgery
        divisions; and capital expenditures to further upgrade our quality systems,
        to
        enhance our manufacturing capabilities in order to support a second drug-eluting
        stent platform, to facilitate the integration of Guidant and to support
        continuous growth in our business units, including our Neuromodulation division.

Our
        investing activities during 2006 included: $15.4 billion of cash payments
        for
        our acquisition of Guidant, including approximately $100 million associated
        with
        the buyout of options of certain former Guidant

vascular
        intervention and endovascular solutions

employees in connection with the sale of these businesses to Abbott, and
        approximately $800 million of direct acquisition costs; $6.7 billion of cash
        acquired from Guidant, including proceeds of $4.1 billion from Guidant’s sale of
        its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott;
        $397
        million in contingent payments associated primarily with Advanced
        Bionics, CryoVascular and Smart Therapeutics, Inc.; and $65 million of net
        payments for strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded
        entities.

In
        January 2007, we acquired EndoTex, a developer of stents used in the treatment
        of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries. In conjunction with the acquisition
        of EndoTex, we paid approximately $100 million, which included approximately
        five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $90 million
        and
        cash of $10 million, in addition to our previous investments and notes issued
        of
        approximately $40 million, plus future consideration that is contingent upon
        EndoTex achieving certain performance-related milestones. We do not expect
        significant purchased research and development charges associated with this
        acquisition because EndoTex obtained FDA approval of its carotid stent system
        prior to acquisition.

Financing
        Activities

Our
        cash
        flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt,
        payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related
        to our
        equity incentive programs.

We
        had
        outstanding borrowings of $8.902 billion at December 31, 2006 at a
        weighted average interest rate of 6.03 percent as compared to outstanding
        borrowings of $2.02 billion at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average
        interest rate of 4.8 percent. During 2006, we received net proceeds from
        borrowings of $6.888 billion,

which
        we
        used primarily to finance the cash portion of the Guidant
        acquisition.

There
        were no amounts outstanding against our available credit lines of $2.35 billion
        at December 31, 2006.  See

Borrowings and Credit Arrangements

to our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K for specific details regarding our 2006 and 2005 debt
        transactions.

The
        debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our long-term
        debt as of December 31, 2006, is as follows:


[Table
            of Contents]

We
        expect
        to use a portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt
        obligations over the next several years. We will continue to examine all
        of our
        operations in order to identify cost improvement measures that will
        better align operating expenses with expected revenue levels and reallocate
        resources to better support growth initiatives. In addition, we have the
        flexibility to sell certain non-strategic assets and implement other strategic
        initiatives, which may generate proceeds that would be available for debt
        repayment.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, our credit ratings were BBB from Fitch Ratings; Baa3 from
        Moody’s Investor Service; and BBB from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
        (S&P). These credit ratings are investment grade. The Moody’s and S&P
        ratings outlook is currently negative.

Our
        revolving credit facility and term loan agreement requires that we maintain
        a
        ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, of less than
        or
        equal to 4.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2007 and 3.5 to 1.0 thereafter.
        The
        agreement also requires that we maintain a ratio of pro forma EBITDA, as
        defined
        by the agreement, to interest expense of greater than or equal to 3.0 to
        1.0. As
        of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with both of these debt covenants.
        Exiting 2006, our ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA was 3.6 to 1.0 and the
        ratio
        of pro forma EBITDA to interest expense was 5.6 to 1.0. Any breach of these
        covenants would require that we obtain waivers from our lenders and there
        can be
        no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers. Our inability to
        obtain
        any necessary waivers, or to obtain them on reasonable terms, could have
        a
        material adverse impact on our operations.

Equity

In
        March
        2006, we filed a new public registration statement with the SEC. During the
        first quarter of 2006, we increased our authorized common stock from 1.2
        billion
        shares to 2.0 billion shares in anticipation of our acquisition of Guidant,
        and
        issued approximately 577 million shares to former Guidant shareholders in
        conjunction with the acquisition. In April 2006, we issued approximately
        million shares of our common stock under this registration statement to Abbott
        for $1.4 billion. See

Note D- Business Combinations

to
        our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K

for
        further details on the Guidant acquisition and Abbott transaction.

During
        2006, we received $145 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to
        our stock option and employee stock purchase plans as compared to $94 million
        in
        2005. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock
        purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors,
        fluctuations in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.

We
        did
        not repurchase any of our common stock during 2006. We repurchased approximately
        25 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $734 million
        in 2005, and 10 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of
        $360 million in 2004. Since 1992, we have repurchased approximately
        132 million shares of our common stock and we have approximately 12 million
        shares of our common stock held in treasury at year-end. Approximately
        37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase
        authorizations.

Contractual
        Obligations and Commitments

The
        following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our
        obligations and commitments to make future payments, which is in addition
        to our
        outstanding principal debt obligations as presented in the previous table.

regarding
        our business combinations, debt obligations and lease arrangements. In
        accordance with U.S. GAAP, our consolidated balance sheets do not reflect
        the
        obligations below that relate to expenses incurred in future
        periods.

These
                  obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital

                  Future
                  interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes
                  in
                  the market interest rates.

Certain
        of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration.
        See

Note
        D - Business Combinations

to our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent
        consideration we could be required to pay associated with our business
        combinations. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, the
        acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount
        of
        contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum
        contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Additionally,
        we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing
        the commitments with cash, including cash obtained through the sale of our
        stock.

Certain
        of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the
        future or may require us to make payments that are contingent upon the company
        achieving certain product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals.
        Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our
        option to acquire these companies or be required to make these contingent
        payments, we have not included future potential payments relating to these
        equity investments in the table above.

At
        December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees
        of
        approximately $90 million, which primarily consisted of financial lines of
        credit provided by banks and collateral for workers’
compensation programs. We enter these letters of credit and bank
        guarantees in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2006, we
        have
        not drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees. At this time, we do not
        believe we will be required to fund any amounts from the guarantees or letters
        of credit and, accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability in
        our
        financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Our letters of credit and bank
        guarantees were immaterial at December 31, 2005.

Critical
        Accounting Policies

We
        have
        adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements
        in
        conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in

Note A—Significant
        Accounting Policies

to our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K.

To
        prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
        management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts
        of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure


[Table
            of Contents]

of
        contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements
        and
        the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
        Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

We
        consider estimates to be critical (1) if we are required to make
        assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation
        or (2) if materially different, estimates could have been made or it is
        reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to
        period. The following are areas that we consider critical:

Revenue
        Recognition

Our
        revenue consists primarily of the sale of single-use medical devices. We
        consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the
        following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a

sales
        arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
        the
        price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
        We
        generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment when the risk of loss
        and
        title passes to the customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement
        exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product
        usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. For all other
        transactions, we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss
        transfer to customers, provided there are no remaining substantive performance
        obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance.
        For
        multiple-element arrangements, whereby the sale of devices is combined with
        future service obligations, we defer revenue on the undelivered elements
        based
        on verifiable objective evidence of fair value.

We
        generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain
        cases, expired products for credit. In addition, we may allow customers to
        return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
        We
        establish a reserve for sales returns when the initial product is sold. We
        base
        our estimate for sales returns upon contractual commitments and historical
        trends and recorded such amount as a reduction to revenue.

We
        offer
        sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates
        and
        discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability
        as
        current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical
        information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If
        we
        are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability
        for the maximum rebate percentage offered.

Inventory
        Reserves

We
        base
        our provisions for excess, obsolete or expired inventory primarily on our
        estimates of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing
        or
        level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result
        in
        recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future.
        The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product
        development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of
        next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies,
        product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates
        related to excess and obsolete inventory.

Valuation
        of Business Combinations

We
        allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire
        and
        liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition.
        We
        then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired
        to
        identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development.


[Table
            of Contents]

We
        base
        the fair value of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that
        use
        information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess
        purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets
        acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including
        estimated cash flows and discount rates, and alternative estimated useful
        life
        assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations, purchased
        research and development charges, and intangible asset amortization expense
        in
        current and future periods.

The
        valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated
        fair
        value at the dates of acquisition related to in-process projects. Our purchased
        research and development represents the value of in-process projects that
        have
        not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future
        uses as
        of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological
        feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market
        the
        underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value
        attributable to these in-process projects at the time of the acquisition.
        If the
        projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize
        the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions
        as a
        whole. In addition, we record certain costs associated with our strategic
        alliances as purchased research and development.

We
        use
        the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research
        and
        development. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax
        cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and
        then
        discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our
        revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market
        growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions
        by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we
        consider, among other factors: the in-process projects’ stage of completion; the
        complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs

already
        incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies
        and other acquired assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated
        useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at
        a
        present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and
        medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects we
        acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following
        ranges of risk-adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows:
        percent to 17 percent in 2006, 18 percent to 27 percent in 2005, and
        18 percent to 27 percent in 2004. We believe that the estimated
        purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair
        value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party
        would pay for the projects.

Impairment
        of Intangible Assets

We
        review
        our intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist
        or
        a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or
        a
        change in their remaining useful life. In addition, we review our
        indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess
        their classification as indefinite-lived assets. To test for impairment,
        we
        calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and compare
        the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values.

We
        test
        our March 31 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for
        impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes
        in
        circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test,
        we
        calculate the fair value of our reporting units as the present value of
        estimated future cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The selection
        and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment
        with respect to revenue and expense growth rates. We have not recorded
        impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated
        statements of operations.

Investments
        in Strategic Alliances

We
        account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise
        significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less
        of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we
        do
        not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method.
        Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant
        influence over an investment requires judgment. Factors that we consider
        in
        determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence
        include, but are not limited to:

•
our
        level of representation on the Board of Directors;

•
our
        participation in the investee’s policy-making processes;

•
        transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business;

•
        interchange of managerial personnel;

•
the
        investee’s financial or technological dependency on us; and

•
our
        ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholders.

We
        regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment
        indicators.

If
        we
        determine that impairment exists and it is other-than-temporary, we recognize
        an
        impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value
        and its fair value. Our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances
        is
        generally limited to our equity investments and notes receivable associated
        with
        these alliances.

        and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio.

Income
        Taxes

We
        utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under
        this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
        differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and
        liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted
        tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences
        to
        reverse.

We
        recognized net deferred tax liabilities of $2.201 billion at December 31,
        2006 and $110 million at December 31, 2005. The liabilities relate
        primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The assets
        relate
        primarily to the establishment of inventory and product-related reserves,
        litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and development,
        net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of
        our
        historical financial performance, we believe we will substantially recover
        these
        assets.

We
        reduce
        our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight
        of
        available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some
        portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence,
        both
        positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance.
        Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations
        for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently
        available information about future years.

We
        do not
        provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where
        we
        have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It
        is not
        practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings
        that
        are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of
        our
        foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are
        $7.186 billion at December 31, 2006 and $2.106 billion at
        December 31, 2005.

We
        provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary
        course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions,
        there
        are many transactions and calculations where


[Table
            of Contents]

the
        ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our
        worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions
        for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our
        estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome
        of
        these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in
        our
        historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have
        a
        material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the
        period
        in which we make such determination.

See

Note I
        — Income Taxes

to our
        2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
        Form 10-K for a detailed analysis of our income tax
        accounting.

Legal,
        Product Liability Costs and Securities Claims

We
        are
        involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual
        property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability
        suits.
        In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which
        if
        granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to
        sell
        our products.

We
        are
        substantially self-insured with respect to general, product liability and
        securities claims and record losses for claims in excess of the limits of
        purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable
        and estimable. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

,
        we
        accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, loss for general product
        liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense based on
        historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and
        estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate
        of a
        probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we
        accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal matters that
        are
        probable and estimable was $485 million at December 31, 2006 and
        $35 million at December 31, 2005. In connection with our acquisition
        of Guidant, the number of product liability claims and other legal proceedings
        filed against us, including private securities litigation and shareholder
        derivative suits, significantly increased. The amounts accrued at December
        31,
        2006 represent primarily accrued legal defense costs related to assumed Guidant
        litigation and product liability claims recorded as part of the purchase
        price.
        In connection with the acquisition of Guidant, we are still assessing certain
        assumed litigation and product liability claims to determine the amounts
        that
        management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation
        and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued in the future. See further
        discussion of our material legal proceedings in

Stock-Based
        Compensation

On
        January 1, 2006, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

,
        which
        requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
        stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
        based on their fair values. We adopted Statement No. 123(R) using the
“modified-prospective method” and have not restated prior period results of
        operations and financial position to reflect the impact of stock-based
        compensation expense under Statement No. 123(R).

We
        use
        the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value
        of
        our stock options. We value restricted stock awards and deferred stock units
        based on the closing trading value of our shares on the date of grant. The
        following represents the assumptions used in calculating our stock-based
        compensation expense that require significant judgment by
        management:

Expected
        Volatility

- We
        have considered a number of factors in estimating volatility. For options
        granted prior to 2006, we used our historical volatility as a basis to estimate
        expected volatility in our valuation of stock options. We changed our method
        of
        estimating volatility upon the adoption of Statement No. 123(R). We now consider
        historical volatility, trends in volatility within our industry/peer group
        and
        implied volatility.

Expected
        Term

- We
        estimate the expected term of our options using historical exercise and
        forfeiture data. We believe that this historical data is currently the best
        estimate of the expected term of our new option grants.


[Table
            of Contents]

Estimated
        Forfeiture Rate

-We have
        applied, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, an annual
        forfeiture rate of eight percent to all unvested stock awards as of December
        31,
        2006, which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each
        year
        over the vesting period. We will reevaluate this analysis periodically and
        adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary. Ultimately, we will only recognize
        expense for those shares that vest.

New
        Accounting Standard

In
        July
        2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -

an
        interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting
        for Income Taxes

,
        to
        create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.
        Interpretation No. 48 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing
        and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
        and
        disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions, including a
        roll
        forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement
        recognition. We will record the cumulative effect of initially adopting
        Interpretation No. 48 as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the
        year
        of adjustment and present such adjustment separately. Only tax positions
        that we
        are more likely than not to realize at the effective date may be recognized
        upon
        adoption of Interpretation No. 48. We are required to adopt Interpretation
        No. 48 effective for our first quarter of 2007. We are currently in the process
        of assessing the impact of the new standard.

Management’s
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

As
        the
        management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing
        and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed
        our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management
        and
        the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
        our
        financial statements.

We
        assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
        as
        of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set
        forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        in
        Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that,
        as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is
        effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.

Ernst &
        Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
        audit
        report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting
        and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
        This
        report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below.

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over
        Financial Reporting

The
        Board
        of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation

We
        have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Boston Scientific
        Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
        as of
        December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
        Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
        of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s
        management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
        financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
        control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
        on
        management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
        internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
        fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
        (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
        necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
        generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
        of
        the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
        and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
        regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
        or
        disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
        financial statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our opinion, management’s assessment that Boston Scientific Corporation
        maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
        December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
        COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained,
        in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
        as
        of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We
        also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets
        of
        Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and December 31,
        2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
        December 31, 2006 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated
        February 26, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM
        7A.       QUANTITATIVE AND
        QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We
        develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and
        cash
        flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and
        interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program
        that
        includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program
        pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter
        derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative
        financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying
        hedged
        exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance
        on
        derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group
        of
        major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions.

Our
        currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm
        commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and
        third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We
        use
        both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative
        instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency
        exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the
        contract amount of $3.413 billion at December 31, 2006 and
        $3.593 billion at December 31, 2005. We recorded $71 million of
        other assets and $27 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair
        value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 as compared to
        $176 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities recorded
        at December 31, 2005. A 10 percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s
        value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative
        instruments’ fair value by $112 million at December 31, 2006 and by
        $129 million at December 31, 2005. A 10 percent depreciation in
        the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the
        derivative instruments’ fair value by $134 million at December 31, 2006 and
        $157 million at December 31, 2005. Any increase or decrease in the
        fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments
        would
        be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair
        value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction.

Our
        interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially
        offset
        by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments
        to
        manage the risk of interest rate changes either by converting floating-rate
        borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings or fixed-rate borrowings into
        floating-rate borrowings. We had interest rate derivative instruments
        outstanding in the notional amount of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and
        $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase in the notional amount
        is due to $2.0 billion of hedge contracts related to our $5.0 billion five-year
        term loan, offset by our termination of $1.1 billion in hedge contracts related
        to certain of our existing senior notes. We recorded $11 million of other
        liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative
        instruments at December 31, 2006 as compared to $21 million of other assets
        and
        $7 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2005. A one percentage
        point increase in interest rates would increase the derivative instruments’ fair
        value by $26 million at December 31, 2006 as compared to a decrease of
        $74 million at December 31, 2005. A one percentage point decrease in
        interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by
        $26 million at December 31, 2006 as compared to an increase of
        $80 million at December 31, 2005. Any increase or decrease in the fair
        value of our interest rate derivative instruments would be substantially
        offset
        by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged interest
        payments related to the hedged term loan. At December 31, 2006, $5.886
        billion, or 81 percent, of our approximately $7.234 billion in outstanding
        net debt is at fixed interest rates.

Note A—Significant
      Accounting Policies

Principles
      of Consolidation

Our
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Boston Scientific
      Corporation and our subsidiaries, substantially all of which we wholly own.
      We
      consider the principles of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
      Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation
      of Variable Interest Entities

and
      Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidation
      of Financial Statements

,
      when
      determining whether an entity is subject to consolidation. We account for
      investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant
      influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the
      voting stock.

On
      April
      21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. Prior to our
      acquisition of Guidant, Abbott Laboratories acquired Guidant’s vascular
      intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the
      drug-eluting technology it acquired from Guidant with us. We consolidated
      Guidant’s operating results with those of Boston Scientific beginning on the
      date of the acquisition, April 21, 2006. See

Note
      D - Business Combinations

for
      further details regarding the transaction.

Accounting
      Estimates

To
      prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
      management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts
      of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
      liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts
      of
      our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could
      differ from these estimates.

Cash,
      Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

We
      record
      cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost, which
      approximates fair value. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased
      with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

We
      invest
      excess cash in high-quality marketable securities consisting primarily of bank
      time deposits. We record available-for-sale investments at fair value. We
      exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on available-for-sale securities
      from earnings and report such gains and losses, net of tax, as a separate
      component of stockholders’ equity until realized. We compute realized gains and
      losses on sales of available-for-sale securities based upon initial cost
      adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. We record
      held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost and adjust for amortization of
      premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. We classify investments in
      debt
      securities or equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value
      that
      we purchase and hold principally for selling them in the near term as trading
      securities. All of our cash investments at December 31, 2006 had maturity dates
      at date of purchase of less than three months and, accordingly, we have
      classified them as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2005, we
      classified our cash investments with maturities greater than 90 days but less
      than one year as available-for-sale. We do not consider any of our investments
      to be held-to-maturity or trading securities at December 31, 2006 and
      December 31, 2005.

Cash,
      cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31 consist of the
      following:


[Table
          of Contents]

The
      amortized cost of marketable securities approximated their fair value at
      December 31, 2005.

Concentrations
      of Credit Risk

Financial
      instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist
      primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative
      financial instrument contracts and accounts receivable. Our investment policy
      limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market
      conditions. Counterparties to financial instruments expose us to credit-related
      losses in the event of nonperformance. We transact our financial instruments
      with a diversified group of major financial institutions and monitor outstanding
      positions to limit our credit exposure.

We
      provide credit, in the normal course of business, to hospitals, healthcare
      agencies, clinics, doctors’ offices and other private and governmental
      institutions. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and
      maintain allowances for potential credit losses.

Revenue
      Recognition

Our
      revenue consists primarily of the sale of single-use medical devices. We
      consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the
      following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists;
      delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or
      determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these
      criteria at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to
      the
      customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize
      revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which
      indicates that the sale is complete. For all other transactions, we recognize
      revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to the customer,
      provided there are no substantive remaining performance obligations required
      of
      us or any matters requiring customer acceptance. For multiple-element
      arrangements, whereby the sale of devices is combined with future service
      obligations, we defer revenue on the undelivered elements based on verifiable
      objective evidence of fair value.

We
      generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain
      cases, expired products for credit. In addition, we may allow customers to
      return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
      We
      establish a reserve for sales returns when the initial product is sold. We
      base
      our estimate for sales returns upon contractual commitments and historical
      trends and record such amount as a reduction to revenue.

We
      offer
      sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and
      discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability
      as
      current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical
      information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If
      we
      are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability
      for the maximum rebate percentage offered.


[Table
          of Contents]

We
      have
      entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our
      products to participating hospitals at pre-negotiated prices. We recognize
      revenue generated from these agreements following the same revenue recognition
      criteria discussed above.

Inventories

We
      state
      inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. We base our
      provisions for excess, obsolete or expired inventory primarily on our estimates
      of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing or level
      of
      demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in
      recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future.
      The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product
      development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of
      next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies,
      product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates
      related to excess and obsolete inventory. We record provisions for inventory
      located in our manufacturing and distribution facilities as cost of sales.
      We
      charge consignment inventory write-downs to selling, general and administrative
      expense. These write-downs approximated $24 million in 2006, $15 million in
      2005, and $10 million in 2004.

Property,
      Plant and Equipment

We
      state
      property, plant, equipment, and leasehold improvements at historical cost,
      except for property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination,
      which we state at fair value. We charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs
      to expense and capitalize additions and improvements. We generally provide
      for
      depreciation using the straight-line method at rates that approximate the
      estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings and improvements
      over a 20 to 40 year life; equipment, furniture and fixtures over a three
      to seven year life; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the
      useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease.

Valuation
      of Business Combinations

We
      record
      intangible assets acquired in recent business combinations under the purchase
      method of accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to
      the
      assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the
      dates of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net
      tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased
      research and development. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible
      assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided
      by
      management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the
      net
      tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill.

Purchased
      Research and Development

Our
      purchased research and development represents the value of in-process projects
      that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative
      future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining
      the
      technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval
      to
      market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense
      the value attributable to these in-process projects at the time of the
      acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner,
      we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for
      the
      acquisitions as a whole. In addition, we record certain costs associated with
      our strategic alliances as purchased research and development.


[Table
          of Contents]

We
        use
        the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research
        and
        development. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax
        cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and
        then
        discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our
        revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market
        growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions
        by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we
        consider, among other factors: the in-process projects’ stage of completion; the
        complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs already
        incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies
        and other acquired assets; the expected introduction date and the estimated
        useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at
        a
        present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and
        medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects we
        acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following
        ranges of risk-adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows:
        percent to 17 percent in 2006, 18 percent to 27 percent in 2005, and
        18 percent to 27 percent in 2004. We believe that the estimated
        purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair
        value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party
        would pay for the projects.

Amortization
        and Impairment of Intangible Assets

We
        record
        intangible assets at historical cost. We amortize our intangible assets using
        the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, as follows: patents
        and licenses, two to 20 years; definite-lived core and developed
        technology, five to 25 years; customer relationships, five to 25 years;
        other intangible assets, various. We review intangible assets subject to
        amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a
        change
        in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change
        in the
        remaining useful life. Conditions that would indicate impairment and trigger
        a
        more frequent impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a
        significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could
        affect the value of an asset, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.
        If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we
        write-down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in
        the
        period identified.

We
        generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash
        flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount
        rate.
        If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, we
        amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively
        over
        the revised remaining useful life. In addition, we review our indefinite-lived
        intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their
        classification as indefinite-lived assets. To test for impairment, we calculate
        the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and compare the
        calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. We record impairments
        of intangible assets as amortization expense in our consolidated statements
        of
        operations.

We
        test
        our March 31 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for
        impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes
        in
        circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test,
        we
        utilize the two-step approach prescribed under FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill
        and Other Intangible Assets

.
        The
        first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units,
        as defined, to the fair value of these units. As of December 31, 2006, we
        identified our 10 domestic divisions, which in aggregate make up the U.S.
        reportable segment, and our three international operating segments as our
        reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment test. To derive the
        carrying value of our reporting units


[Table
            of Contents]

at
        the
        time of acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect
        to
        benefit from the respective business combination. In addition, assets and
        liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s
        operations and would be considered in determining fair value, are allocated
        to
        the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly
        related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit
        benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each
        reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
        value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
        measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill
        impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill
        to its carrying value. Since the adoption of Statement No. 142, we have not
        performed the second step of the impairment test because the fair value of
        each
        reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value.

Investments
        in Strategic Alliances

We
        account for our publicly traded investments as available-for-sale securities
        based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period. We compute
        realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities based
        on the
        average cost method, adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair
        value. We account for our investments for which fair value is not readily
        determinable in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18,

The
        Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

,
        Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 02-14,

Whether
        an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments other
        than Common Stock

and FASB
        Staff Position Nos. 115-1 and 124-1,

The
        Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
        Investments.

We
        account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise
        significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less
        of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we
        do
        not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method.
        Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant
        influence over an investment requires judgment. Factors that we consider
        in
        determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence
        include, but are not limited to:

•
our
        level of representation on the Board of Directors;

•
our
        participation in the investee’s policy-making processes;

•
        transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business;

•
        interchange of managerial personnel;

•
the
        investee’s financial or technological dependency on us; and

•
our
        ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholders.

For
        investments accounted for under the equity method, we initially record the
        investment at cost, and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of
        the
        earnings or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to
        those
        made in preparing consolidated financial statements.

Each
        reporting period, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any
        events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect
        on
        the fair value of the investment. Examples of such impairment indicators
        include, but are not limited to: a significant deterioration in earnings
        performance; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or
        technological environment of an investee; or a significant doubt about an
        investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we identify an impairment
        indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare
        it to
        its carrying value. If the fair value of the investment is less than its
        carrying value, the investment is impaired and we make a determination as
        to


[Table
            of Contents]

whether
        the impairment is other-than-temporary. We deem impairment to be
        other-than-temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment
        for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of
        the
        investment. Further, evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the
        investment is recoverable within a reasonable period. For other-than-temporary
        impairments, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between
        an
        investment’s carrying value and its fair value. Impairment losses on these
        investments are included in other, net in our consolidated statements of
        operations.

Income
        Taxes

We
        utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under
        this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
        differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and
        liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted
        tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences
        to
        reverse.

We
        recognized net deferred tax liabilities of $2.201 billion at December 31,
        2006 and $110 million at December 31, 2005. The liabilities relate
        primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The assets
        relate
        primarily to the establishment of inventory and product-related reserves,
        litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and development,
        net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of
        our
        historical financial performance, we believe we will substantially recover
        these assets. See

Note I—Income
        Taxes

for a
        detailed analysis of our deferred tax positions.

We
        reduce
        our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight
        of
        available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some
        portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence,
        both
        positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance.
        Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations
        for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently
        available information about future years.

We
        provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary
        course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions,
        there
        are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
        uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax
        provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes
        for
        all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable,
        we
        can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not
        be
        different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax
        provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on
        our
        income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make
        such
        determination.

Legal,
        Product Liability Costs and Securities Claims

We
        are
        involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual
        property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability
        suits.
        In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which,
        if
        granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to
        sell
        our products. We are substantially self-insured with respect to general,
        product
        liability and securities claims and record losses for claims in excess of
        purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable
        and estimable. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

,
        we
        accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, loss for product liability
        claims and, under certain


[Table
            of Contents]

conditions,
        costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific
        losses
        are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred.
        If
        the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range
        is
        more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal
        matters that are probable and estimable was $485 million at December 31,
        2006 and $35 million at December 31, 2005. The amounts accrued at
        December 31, 2006 represent primarily accrued legal defense costs related
        to
        assumed Guidant litigation and product liability claims recorded as part
        of the
        purchase price. In connection with the acquisition of Guidant, we are still
        assessing certain assumed litigation and product liability claims to determine
        the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims
        and
        litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued in the future.

See

Note J
        - Commitments and Contingencies

for
        further discussion of our individual material legal proceedings.

Warranty
        Obligations

We
        estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on
        historical experience and record a liability at the time product is sold.
        Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold,
        the
        historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim.
        We
        regularly assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust
        the amounts as necessary. We record a reserve equal to the costs to repair
        or
        otherwise satisfy the claim. Expense attributable to warranties was not material
        to our consolidated statements of operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Costs
        Associated with Exit Activities

We
        record
        employee termination costs in accordance with FASB Statement No. 112,

Employer’s
        Accounting for Postemployment Benefits

,
        if we
        pay the benefits as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement, which includes
        benefits provided as part of our domestic severance policy or that we provide
        in
        accordance with international statutory requirements. We accrue employee
        termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the
        obligation is attributable to prior services rendered, the rights to the
        benefits have vested and the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate
        the liability. We account for employee termination benefits that represent
        a
        one-time benefit in accordance with FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting
        for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

We
        generally record such costs into expense over the future service period,
        if any.
        In addition, in conjunction with an exit activity, we may offer voluntary
        termination benefits to employees. These benefits are recorded when the employee
        accepts the termination benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
        Other costs associated with exit activities may include costs related to
        leased
        facilities to be abandoned or subleased and long-lived asset impairments.

In
        addition, we account for costs to exit an activity of an acquired company 
and involuntary employee termination benefits and relocation
        costs associated with acquired businesses in accordance with EITF No.
        95-3,

Recognition
        of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
        Combination

.   We include exit
        costs in the purchase price allocation of the acquired business if a plan
        to
        exit an activity of an acquired company exists and those costs have no
        future economic benefit to us and will be incurred as a direct result
        of the exit plan, or the exit costs represent amounts to be incurred by
        us under a contractual obligation of the acquired entity that existed prior
        to the acquisition date.  We recognize involuntary employee
        termination benefits and relocation costs as liabilities assumed as of the
        acquisition date when management approves and commits to a plan of termination,
        and communicates the termination arrangement to the
        employees.

Translation
        of Foreign Currency

We
        translate all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries at the year-end
        exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates
        in
        effect during the year. We show the net effect of these translation adjustments
        in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a component of
        stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included
        in other, net in our consolidated statements of operations. These gains and
        losses were not material to our consolidated statements of operations for
        2006,
        2005, and 2004.


[Table
            of Contents]

Financial
        Instruments

We
        recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial
        statements at fair value, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding
        the
        instrument, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting
        for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

.
        We
        record changes in the fair value of derivative instruments in earnings unless
        we
        meet hedge accounting criteria. For derivative instruments designated as
        fair
        value hedges, we record the changes in fair value of both the derivative
        instrument and the hedged item in earnings. For derivative instruments
        designated as cash flow hedges, we record the effective portions of changes
        in
        fair value, net of tax, in other comprehensive income. For derivative
        instruments designated as net investment hedges, we record the effective
        portions of changes in fair value in other comprehensive income as part of
        the
        cumulative translation adjustment. We recognize any ineffective portion of
        our
        hedges in earnings.

The
        carrying amounts of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings approximate
        their fair values at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. We base the
        fair
        value of our fixed-rate long-term debt on market prices. Carrying amounts
        of
        floating-rate long-term debt approximate their fair value.

Shipping
        and Handling Costs

We
        do not
        generally bill customers for shipping and handling of our products. Shipping
        and
        handling costs of $108 million in 2006, $92 million in 2005 and
        $72 million in 2004 are included in selling, general and administrative
        expenses.

Research
        and Development

We
        expense research and development costs, including new product development
        programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research as incurred.

Post-Retirement
        Benefit Plans

We
        maintain retirement plans covering our executives, divisional presidents
        and
        international employees. The assets, liabilities and costs associated with
        these
        plans were not material in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

In
        connection with our acquisition of Guidant, we sponsor the Guidant Retirement
        Plan, a frozen noncontributory defined benefit plan, covering a select group
        of
        current and former employees. The funding policy for the plan is consistent
        with
        U.S. employee benefit and tax-funding regulations. Plan assets, which we
        maintain in a trust, consist primarily of equity and fixed-income instruments.
        We also sponsor the Guidant Excess Benefit Plan, a frozen nonqualified plan
        for
        certain former officers and employees of Guidant. The Guidant Excess Benefit
        Plan was funded through a Rabbi Trust that contains segregated company assets
        used to pay the benefit obligations related to the plan.

In
        addition, certain former U.S. and Puerto Rico employees of Guidant were eligible
        to receive Company-paid healthcare retirement benefits.  As part of the
        Guidant integration and the effort to develop a more scalable, consistent
        benefit plan Company-wide, these benefits were frozen. Former Guidant
        employees that met certain criteria as of December 31, 2006 and retired within
        two years thereafter are eligible to receive the benefits under the plan.


[Table
            of Contents]

We
        use a
        December 31 measurement date for these plans. The outstanding obligation as
        of December 31, 2006 is as follows:

The
        weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December
        31, 2006 are as follows:

Net
        (Loss) Income per Common Share

We
        base
        net (loss) income per common share upon the weighted average number of common
        shares and common share equivalents outstanding each year. Potential common
        stock equivalents are determined using the treasury method. We exclude stock
        options whose effect would be anti-dilutive from the calculation.

New
        Accounting Standards

In
        December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

,
        which
        is a revision of Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

.
        Statement No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and
        amends Statement No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

.
        See

Note
        L - Stock Ownership Plans

for
        discussion of our adoption of the standard and its impact on our financial
        statements for the year ended December 31, 2006.

In
        July
        2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,
        an
        interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting
        for Income Taxes

,
        to
        create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.
        Interpretation No. 48 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing
        and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
        and
        disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions, including a
        roll
        forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement
        recognition. We will record the cumulative effect of initially adopting
        Interpretation No. 48 as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the
        year
        of adoption and will present such adjustment separately. Only tax positions
        that
        we are more likely than not to realize at the effective date may be recognized
        upon adoption of Interpretation No. 48. We are required to adopt
        Interpretation No. 48


[Table
            of Contents]

effective
        for our first quarter of 2007. We are currently in the process of assessing
        the
        impact of the new standard.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,

Fair
        Value Measurements

.
        Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
        fair
        value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value
        measurements. Statement No. 157 does not require any new fair value
        measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that
        require
        or permit fair value measurements. We are required to apply the provisions
        of
        Statement No. 157 prospectively as of January 1, 2008, and recognize any
        transition adjustment as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance
        of retained earnings. We are in the process of determining the effect of
        adoption of Statement No. 157, but we do not believe such adoption will
        materially impact

our
        future results of operations or financial position.

In
        September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering
        the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
        Current Year Financial Statements

.
        Bulletin No. 108 expresses the SEC staff’s views regarding the process of
        quantifying financial statement misstatements. Bulletin No. 108 requires
        that,
        in addition to considering the amount of the error originating in the current
        year statement of operations, the misstatement existing at each balance sheet
        date should also be considered, irrespective of the period of origin of the
        error (rollover approach versus iron curtain approach). The registrant must
        then
        evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that,
        when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is
        material. We adopted Bulletin No. 108 for the year ended December 31, 2006.
        Our
        adoption of Bulletin No. 108 did not result in the recording of a cumulative
        effect adjustment to retained earnings or any revisions to prior reporting
        periods since we had previously evaluated misstatements using both the rollover
        approach and the iron curtain approach, and did not have any material
        misstatements under either methodology.

        have
        reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year’s
        presentation, including amounts for prior years included in

for details on our intangible assets.

Note C—Investments
        in Strategic Alliances

We
        have
        entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and
        publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments
        in
        privately held equity securities or investments where an observable quoted
        market value does not exist. We enter these strategic alliances to broaden
        our
        product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into
        existing and new markets. Many of these companies are in the developmental
        stage
        and have not yet commenced their principal operations. Our exposure to loss
        related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity
        investments and notes receivable associated with these alliances.

Equity
        investments in strategic alliances at December 31 consist of the following:


[Table
            of Contents]

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, we held investments totaling $95 million in four
        companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership
        percentages in these companies range from approximately 21 percent to
        28 percent. The aggregate value of our equity method investments for which
        a quoted market price is available is approximately $125 million, for which
        the
        associated carrying value is approximately $77 million. The aggregate
        difference between the carrying value of the investments and the value of
        our
        share in the net assets of the investee at the time that we determined that
        the
        investments qualified for equity method accounting was approximately
        $117 million. This difference was attributable primarily to goodwill, which
        is not being amortized; purchased research and development, which was
        written-off at the time of application of the equity method of accounting;
        and
        intangible assets, which are being amortized over their estimated useful
        lives
        ranging from five to 20 years.

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, we held investments totaling $85 million in three
        companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership
        percentages in these companies ranged from approximately 21 percent to 28
        percent. The aggregate value of our equity method investments for which a
        quoted
        market price was available was approximately $207 million, for which the
        associated carrying value was approximately $63 million. The aggregate
        difference between the carrying value of the investments and the value of
        our
        share in the net assets of the investee at the time that we determined that
        the
        investments qualified for equity method accounting was approximately
        $70 million. This difference is attributable primarily to goodwill, and
        intangible assets, which are being amortized over their estimated useful
        lives
        ranging from five to 20 years.

We
        regularly review our strategic investments for impairment indicators. Based
        on
        this review, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of approximately
        $78 million in 2006 related to cost method investments, the most
        significant impairment related to the termination of a gene therapy trial
        being
        conducted by one of our portfolio companies. This trial was suspended in
        March
        2006 and patient enrollment was terminated in April 2006. The remaining carrying
        value of these cost method investments at December 31, 2006 was $49
        million. We determined there was no impairment on the remaining
        $306 million of our cost method investments. As of December 31, 2006, we
        recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $4 million associated
        with


[Table
            of Contents]

certain
        of our available-for-sale investments. As of December 31, 2006, we had six
        available-for-sale investments in an unrealized loss position. The duration
        of
        the unrealized loss was less than 12 months for each investment. The aggregate
        carrying value of the investments was $87 million and the aggregate
        unrealized loss was $10 million. We do not consider these investments to
        be
        other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2006 due to the duration of
        the unrealized loss position and our ability and intent to hold the investments
        for a reasonable period sufficient for a recovery of the unrealized
        loss.

We
        recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $10 million in 2005 associated
        with certain cost method investments. The remaining carrying value of these
        investments at December 31, 2005 was $16 million. We determined there
        were no impairment indicators present for the remaining $350 million of our
        cost method investments. We recorded other-than-temporary impairments of
        $3
        million associated with certain of our available-for-sale investments. As
        of
        December 31, 2005, we had two available-for-sale investments with an
        aggregate carrying value of $10 million and unrealized loss position of
        $4 million. The duration of the unrealized loss position was less than
        12 months. We did not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily
        impaired at December 31, 2005 due to the duration of the impairment and our
        ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period sufficient
        for
        a forecasted recovery of the unrealized loss. In addition, during 2005, we
        wrote-off our $24 million investment in Medinol, Ltd. We canceled our
        equity investment in conjunction with the litigation settlement with Medinol.
        The write-down of the Medinol investment is included in litigation-related
        charges in our consolidated statements of operations.

We
        had
        notes receivable of approximately $113 million at December 31, 2006 and $112
        million at December 31, 2005 due from privately held and publicly traded
        companies. We recorded write-downs of notes receivable of $39 million in
        2006, related primarily to technological delays and financial deterioration
        of
        certain of our vascular sealing and gene therapy portfolio companies. We
        recorded write-downs of notes receivable of $4 million in 2005.

Over
        time, we will continue to reprioritize our internal research and development
        project portfolio and our external investment portfolio. This
        reprioritization may result in the decision to sell, discontinue, write-down,
        or
        otherwise reduce the funding of certain projects, operations, investments
        or assets. Any proceeds from sales, or any increases in operating cash flows,
        resulting from subsequent reviews may be used to reduce debt incurred to
        fund
        the Guidant acquisition, or may be reinvested in other research and development
        projects or other operational initiatives.

Note D—Business
        Combinations

During
        2006, we paid $28.4 billion to acquire Guidant through a combination of cash,
        common stock, and fully vested stock options. During 2005, we paid
        $178 million in cash to acquire TriVascular, Inc., CryoVascular
        Systems, Inc. and Rubicon Medical Corporation and paid $120 million in
        shares of our common stock to acquire Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc.
        (AST). During 2004, we paid $804 million in cash to acquire Advanced
        Bionics Corporation and Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. (PVS). These
        acquisitions were intended to strengthen our leadership position in
        interventional medicine. Our consolidated financial statements include the
        operating results for each acquired entity from its respective date of
        acquisition. Given the materiality of the transaction, we have included
        supplemental pro forma financial information to give effect to the Guidant
        acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of 2006 and 2005 below.
        Pro forma information is not presented for our other acquisitions given the
        immateriality of their results to our consolidated financial statements.


[Table
            of Contents]

        Business Combinations

On
        April
        21, 2006, we acquired 100 percent of the fully diluted equity of Guidant
        Corporation. Guidant is a world leader in the treatment of cardiac and vascular
        disease. With this acquisition, we have become a major provider in the more
        than
        $9 billion global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business, enhancing our
        overall competitive position and long-term growth potential and further
        diversifying our product portfolio. This acquisition has established us as
        one
        of the world’s largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in
        microelectronic therapeutics.

The
        aggregate purchase price of $28.4 billion included: $14.5 billion in cash;
        million shares of our common stock at an estimated fair value of $12.5 billion;
        approximately 40 million of our fully vested stock options granted to Guidant
        employees at an estimated fair value of approximately $450 million;
        approximately $100 million associated with the buyout of options of certain
        former vascular intervention and endovascular solutions Guidant employees;
        and
        approximately $800 million of direct acquisition costs, including a $705
        million
        payment made to Johnson & Johnson in connection with the termination of its
        merger agreement with Guidant. The purchase price net of cash acquired was
        approximately $21.7 billion. In conjunction with the acquisition, and partially
        offsetting the purchase price, we acquired approximately $6.7 billion of
        cash,
        including $4.1 billion in connection with Guidant’s prior sale of its vascular
        intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott. The remaining
        cash
        relates to cash on hand at the time of closing. There is no potential
        contingent consideration payable to the former Guidant
        shareholders.

Upon
        the
        closing of the acquisition, each share of Guidant common stock (other than
        shares owned by Guidant and Boston Scientific) was converted into (i) $42.00
        in
        cash, (ii) 1.6799 shares of Boston Scientific common stock, and (iii) $0.0132
        in
        cash per share for each day beginning on April 1 through the closing date
        of
        April 21, representing an additional $0.28 per share. The number of Boston
        Scientific shares issued for each Guidant share was based on an exchange
        ratio
        determined by dividing $38.00 by the average closing price of Boston Scientific
        common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending three days
        prior to the closing date, so long as the average closing price during that
        period was between $22.62 and $28.86. If the average closing price during
        that
        period was below $22.62, the merger agreement specified a fixed exchange
        ratio
        of 1.6799 shares of Boston Scientific common stock for each share of Guidant
        common stock. Because the average closing price of Boston Scientific common
        stock during that period was less than $22.62, Guidant shareholders received
        1.6799 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant common
        stock.

We
        measured the fair value of the 577 million shares of our common stock issued
        as
        consideration in conjunction with our acquisition of Guidant under Statement
        No.
        141 and EITF No. 99-12,

Determination
        of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued
        in a
        Purchase Business Combination

.
        We
        determined the measurement date to be April 17, 2006, the first date on which
        the average 20-day closing price fell below $22.62 and the number of Boston
        Scientific shares to be issued according to the exchange ratio became fixed
        without subsequent revision. We valued the securities based on average market
        prices a few days before and after the measurement date (beginning on April
        and ending on April 19), which did not include any dates after the April
        closing date of the acquisition. The weighted average stock price so determined
        was $21.68.

To
        finance the cash portion of the Guidant acquisition, we borrowed $6.6 billion
        consisting of a $5.0 billion five-year term loan and a $700 million 364-day
        interim credit facility loan from a syndicate of commercial and investment
        banks, as well as a $900 million subordinated loan from Abbott.

        F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements

for
        further details regarding the debt issued to finance the cash portion of
        the
        Guidant acquisition.

We
        made
        our offer to acquire Guidant after the execution of a merger agreement between
        Guidant and Johnson & Johnson. On January 25, 2006, Guidant
        terminated the Johnson & Johnson merger agreement and, in connection
        with the termination, Guidant paid Johnson & Johnson a termination fee
        of $705 million. We then reimbursed Guidant for the full amount of the
        termination fee paid to Johnson & Johnson.

We
        continue to incur integration and restructuring costs as we integrate certain
        operations of Guidant.

Abbott
        Transaction

On
        April
        21, 2006, before the closing of the Boston Scientific-Guidant transaction,
        Abbott acquired Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions
        businesses for:

·

an
                  initial payment of $4.1 billion in cash at the Abbott transaction
                  closing;

·

a
                  milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of an approval from
                  the U.S. FDA within ten years after the Abbott transaction closing
                  to
                  market and sell an everolimus-eluting stent in the U.S.;
                  and

·

a
                  milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of an approval from
                  the
                  Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare within ten years
                  after the Abbott transaction closing to market and sell an
                  everolimus-eluting stent in Japan.

In
        addition, Abbott loaned us $900 million on a subordinated basis.
        See

Note
        F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements

for
        further details regarding the Abbott loan.

Further,
        Abbott purchased from us approximately 65 million shares of our common stock
        for
        $1.4 billion, or $21.66 per share. Abbott agreed not to sell any of these
        shares of common stock for six months following the transaction closing
        unless the average price per share of our common stock over any consecutive
        20-day trading period during that six-month period exceeded $30.00. In addition,
        during the 18-month period following the transaction closing, Abbott will
        not, in any one-month period, sell more than 8.33 percent of these shares
        of our
        common stock. Abbott must sell all of these shares of our common stock no
        later
        than 30 months following April 21, 2006 and must apply a portion of the net
        proceeds from its sale of these shares of our common stock in excess of
        specified amounts, if any, to reduce the principal amount of the loan from
        Abbott to Boston Scientific (sharing of proceeds feature).

We
        determined the fair value of the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott
        stock
        purchase as of April 21, 2006 to be $103 million and recorded this amount
        as an
        asset received in connection with the sale of the Guidant vascular intervention
        and endovascular solutions business to Abbott. We revalue this instrument
        each
        reporting period, and recorded net expense of approximately $95 million during
        2006 to reflect the change in fair value. We will record fair value adjustments
        on this feature until all of the underlying shares are sold by Abbott. As
        of
        December 31, 2006, we


[Table
            of Contents]

have
        an
        asset of approximately $8 million remaining, which reflects the estimated
        fair
        value of this feature as of December 31, 2006.

We
        used a
        Monte Carlo simulation methodology in determining the value of the sharing
        of
        proceeds feature. We estimated the fair values on December 31, 2006 and April
        21, 2006 using the following assumptions:

Approximately
        18 months following the Abbott transaction closing, we will issue to Abbott
        additional shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to
        $60 million (based on the average closing price of our common stock during
        the 20 consecutive trading day period ending five trading days prior to the
        date
        of issuance of those shares) to reimburse Abbott for the cost of borrowing
        $1.4
        billion to purchase the shares of our common stock. We have recorded the
        $60
        million of stock to be issued as a liability assumed in connection with the
        sale
        of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to
        Abbott.

Prior
        to
        the Abbott transaction closing, Boston Scientific and Abbott entered into
        transition services agreements under which (i) we will provide or make available
        to the Guidant vascular and endovascular solutions businesses acquired by
        Abbott
        those services, rights, properties and assets of Guidant that were not included
        in the assets purchased by Abbott and that are reasonably required by Abbott
        to
        enable them to conduct the Guidant vascular and endovascular solutions
        businesses substantially as conducted at the time of the Abbott transaction
        closing; and (ii) Abbott will provide or make available to us those services,
        rights, properties and assets reasonably required by Boston Scientific to
        enable
        it to conduct the business conducted by Guidant, other than the Guidant vascular
        and endovascular solutions businesses, in substantially the same manner as
        conducted as of the Abbott transaction closing, to the extent those services,
        rights, properties and assets were included in the assets purchased by Abbott.
        These transition services are available at prices based on costs incurred
        in
        performing the services. Many of these transition services agreements expire
        during 2007.

Purchase
        Price

We
        have
        accounted for the acquisition of Guidant as a purchase under U.S. GAAP. Under
        the purchase method of accounting, we recorded the assets and liabilities
        of
        Guidant as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values, and
        consolidated them with those of legacy Boston Scientific. The purchase
        price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired
        and liabilities assumed. We are in the process of gathering information to
        finalize our valuation of certain assets and liabilities, primarily the
        determination of amounts that may be paid as a result of assumed product
        liability claims. We will finalize the purchase price allocation once we
        have
        the necessary information to complete our estimate, but generally no later
        than
        one year from the acquisition date. The preparation of the valuation required
        the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Critical estimates included,
        but were not limited to, future expected


[Table
            of Contents]

cash
        flows and the applicable discount rates as of the date of the
        acquisition. We based these estimates on assumptions that we believed to be
        reasonable as of the date of the acquisition. However, actual results may
        differ
        from these estimates.

The
        preliminary purchase price is as follows (in millions):

The
        fair
        value of the Boston Scientific stock options exchanged for Guidant options
        was
        included in the purchase price due to the fact that the options were fully
        vested. We estimated the fair value of these options using a Black-Scholes
        option-pricing model. We estimated the fair value of the stock options assuming
        no expected dividends and the following weighted-average
        assumptions:

        Purchase Price Allocation

        following chart summarizes the Guidant preliminary purchase price allocation

The
        deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to the tax impact of future
        amortization associated with the identified intangible assets acquired, which
        are not deductible for tax purposes.


[Table
            of Contents]

We
        allocated the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible
        assets acquired to specific intangible asset categories as follows:

We
        believe that the estimated intangible assets and purchased research and
        development so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition
        and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the assets. We used
        the
        income approach to determine the fair value of the amortizable intangible
        assets
        and purchased research and development. We valued and accounted for the
        identified intangible assets and purchased research and development in
        accordance with our policy as described in

Note
        A - Significant Accounting Policies

.

Various
        factors contributed to the establishment of goodwill, including: the strategic
        benefit of entering the CRM market and diversifying our product portfolio;
        the
        value of Guidant’s highly trained assembled workforce as of the acquisition
        date; the expected revenue growth over time that is attributable to expanded
        indications and increased market penetration from future products and customers;
        the incremental value to our existing interventional cardiology franchise
        from
        having two drug-eluting stent platforms; and the synergies expected to result
        from combining infrastructures, reducing combined operational spend and program
        reprioritization. The goodwill acquired in the Guidant acquisition is not
        deductible for tax purposes. We have allocated the goodwill to our reportable
        segments as follows: $7.642 billion to the U.S., $3.7 billion to
        Europe, $625 million to Inter-Continental and $387 million to Japan.
        We allocated goodwill by business segment based on the relative enterprise
        fair
        value of each segment at the date of acquisition.

The
        core
        technology consists of technical processes, intellectual property, and
        institutional understanding with respect to products or processes that have
        been
        developed by Guidant and that will be leveraged in future products or processes.
        Core technology represents know-how, patented and unpatented technology,
        testing
        methodologies and hardware that will be carried forward from one product
        generation to the next. Over 90 percent of the value assigned to core technology
        is associated with Guidant’s CRM products and includes battery and capacitor
        technology, lead technology, software algorithms, and interfacing for shocking
        and pacing.


[Table
            of Contents]

The
        developed technology acquired from Guidant represents the value associated
        with
        currently marketed products that have received FDA approval as of the
        acquisition date. Guidant’s currently marketed products include:

·

Implantable
                  cardioverter defibrillator systems used to detect and treat abnormally
                  fast heart rhythms (tachycardia) that could result in sudden cardiac
                  death, including implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy
                  defibrillator systems used to treat heart
                  failure;

·

Implantable
                  pacemaker systems used to manage slow or irregular heart rhythms
                  (bradycardia), including implantable cardiac resynchronization
                  therapy
                  pacemaker systems used to treat heart failure;
                  and

·

Cardiac
                  surgery systems used to perform cardiac surgical ablation, endoscopic
                  vein
                  harvesting and clampless beating-heart bypass
                  surgery.

The
        currently marketed products include products primarily within the Insignia,
        Prizm, Vitality, Contak TR and Contak Renewal CRM product families, the
        VASOVIEW

®

Endoscopic Vein Harvesting System, FLEX Microwave Systems
        and the ACROBAT™ System.

Customer
        relationships represent the estimated fair value of the non-contractual customer
        relationships Guidant had with physician customers as of the acquisition
        date.
        The primary physician users of Guidant’s largest selling products include
        electrophysiologists, implanting cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons,
        and
        cardiac surgeons. These relationships were valued separately from goodwill
        as
        Guidant (i) has information about and has regular contact with its physician
        customers and (ii) the physician customers have the ability to make direct
        contact with Guidant. We used the income approach to estimate the fair value
        of
        customer relationships as of the acquisition date.

Pro
        Forma Results of Operations

Our
        consolidated financial statements include Guidant’s operating results from the
        date of acquisition, April 21, 2006. The following unaudited pro forma
        information presents a summary of consolidated results of our operations
        and
        Guidant, as if the acquisition, the Abbott transaction and the financing
        for the
        acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented.
        We
        have adjusted the historical consolidated financial information to give effect
        to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition
        and (ii) factually supportable. We present the unaudited pro forma
        condensed consolidated financial information for informational purposes only.
        The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what the financial
        position or results of operations actually would have been had the acquisition,
        the sale of the Guidant vascular and endovascular solutions businesses to
        Abbott
        and the financing transactions with Abbott and other lenders been completed
        at
        the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
        financial information does not purport to project the future financial position
        or operating results of the combined Company after completion of the
        acquisition. Pro forma adjustments are tax-effected at our effective tax
        rate.


[Table
            of Contents]

The
        pro
        forma net loss includes amortization expense associated with intangible assets
        obtained in conjunction with the Guidant acquisition of $480 million for
        and 2005. The unaudited pro forma financial information for each period
        presented also includes the following non-recurring charges: purchased research
        and development of $4.169 billion obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition;
        $267 million in expense associated with the step-up value of acquired inventory
        sold; a tax charge for the drug-eluting stent license right obtained from
        Abbott; and $95 million for the fair value adjustment related to the sharing
        of
        proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase. In connection with the accounting
        for the acquisition of Guidant, we wrote-up inventory acquired from
        manufacturing cost to fair value. As of December 31, 2006, we had no inventory
        step-up value remaining in inventory.

Costs
        Associated with Exit Activities

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, we included in the Guidant purchase price allocation an
        accrual for $198 million in acquisition-related costs that included:
        approximately $173 million for involuntary terminations, change-in-control
        payments, relocation and related costs; and approximately $25 million of
        estimated costs to cancel contractual commitments.

As
        of the
        acquisition date, management began to assess and formulate plans to exit
        certain
        Guidant activities. As a result of these exit plans, we will make severance,
        relocation and change-in-control payments. The majority of the exit cost
        accrual
        relates to our plan to reduce the acquired CRM workforce by approximately
        500 to
        600 employees during the first quarter of 2007. The affected workforce included
        primarily research and development employees, although employees within sales
        and marketing and certain other functions were also impacted. We also plan
        to
        make smaller workforce reductions internationally across multiple functions
        in
        order to eliminate duplicate facilities and rationalize our distribution
        network
        in certain countries.

We
        are in
        the process of gathering information to finalize these integration
        activities.

The
        components of our accrual for Guidant-related exit and other costs are as
        follows:

        Business Combinations

In
        March 2005, we acquired 100 percent of the fully diluted equity of AST
        for approximately 3.6 million shares of our common stock, which was valued
        at approximately $120 million on the date of acquisition. We may also be
        required to make earn-out payments in the future that are contingent upon
        AST
        achieving certain regulatory and performance-related milestones. AST is a
        developer of stent delivery systems that are designed to address coronary
        artery
        disease in bifurcated vessels. The acquisition was intended to provide us
        with
        an expanded stent technology and intellectual property portfolio.

In
        April 2005, we acquired 100 percent of the fully diluted equity of
        TriVascular for approximately $65 million in addition to our previous
        investments and notes issued of approximately $45 million. TriVascular is a
        developer of medical devices and procedures used for treating abdominal aortic
        aneurysms (AAA). The acquisition was intended to expand our vascular surgery
        technology portfolio. During the second quarter of 2006, management cancelled
        the TriVascular AAA stent-graft program. The program cancellation was due
        principally to forecasted increases in time and costs to complete the
        development of the stent-graft and to receive regulatory approval. The
        cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program resulted in the shutdown of our
        facility in Santa Rosa, California and the displacement of approximately
        employees. During the second quarter of 2006, we recorded a charge to research
        and development expenses of approximately $20 million associated primarily
        with
        write-downs of fixed assets and a charge to research and development expenses
        of
        approximately $10 million associated with severance and related costs incurred
        in connection with the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program. In addition,
        we recorded an impairment charge related to the remaining TriVascular intangible
        assets and reversed our accrual for contingent payments recorded in the initial
        purchase accounting. The effect of the write-off of these assets and liabilities
        was a $23 million charge to amortization expense and a $67 million credit
        to
        purchased research and development during the second quarter of 2006. We
        substantially completed the shutdown activities during the third quarter
        of
        2006.

In
        April 2005, we acquired 100 percent of the fully diluted equity of
        CryoVascular for approximately $50 million in addition to our previous
        investments of approximately $10 million. We may also be required to make
        earn-out payments in the future that are contingent upon CryoVascular achieving
        certain performance related-milestones. CryoVascular is a developer and
        manufacturer of a proprietary angioplasty device to treat atherosclerotic
        disease of the legs and other peripheral arteries, which we previously
        distributed. The acquisition was intended to expand our peripheral vascular
        technology portfolio.

In
        June 2005, we completed our acquisition of 100 percent of the fully
        diluted equity of Rubicon for approximately $70 million in addition to our
        previous investments of approximately $20 million. We may also be required
        to make earn-out payments in the future that are contingent upon Rubicon
        achieving certain regulatory and performance related-milestones. Rubicon
        is a
        developer of embolic protection filters for use in interventional cardiovascular
        procedures. The acquisition was intended to strengthen our leadership position
        in interventional cardiovascular procedures. In 2006, we wrote off

$21
        million of the intangible assets to amortization expense associated with
        developed technology obtained as part of the acquisition. The write-off of
        the
        Rubicon developed technology resulted from a management decision to redesign
        the
        first generation of the technology and concentrate resources on the
        commercialization of the second-generation product.

        Business Combinations

On
        June 1, 2004, we completed our acquisition of 100 percent of the fully
        diluted equity of Advanced Bionics for an initial payment of approximately
        $740 million in cash, plus possible future earn-out payments. Advanced
        Bionics develops implantable microelectronic technologies for treating numerous
        neurological disorders. Its neuromodulation technology includes a range of
        neurostimulators (or implantable pulse generators), programmable drug pumps
        and
        cochlear implants. The Advanced Bionics acquisition was intended to expand
        our
        technology portfolio into the implantable microelectronic device market.

The
        Advanced Bionics acquisition was structured to include earn-out payments
        that
        are contingent primarily on the achievement of future performance milestones.
        The performance milestones are segmented by Advanced Bionics’ four principal
        technology platforms (cochlear implants, implantable pulse generators, drug
        pumps and bion microstimulators) and each milestone has a specific earn-out
        period, which generally commences on the date of the related product launch.
        Base earn-out payments on these performance milestones approximate
        two-and-a-quarter times incremental sales for each annual period. There are
        also
        bonus earn-out payments available based on the attainment of certain aggregate
        sales performance targets and a certain gross margin level. The milestones
        associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain periods
        through 2013. The estimated potential amount of future contingent consideration
        (undiscounted) that we could be required to make associated with our acquisition
        of Advanced Bionics is approximately $3 billion. The estimated cumulative
        revenue level (undiscounted) to be generated by Advanced Bionics during the
        remaining earnout period is approximately $7 billion. We will allocate
        these payments, if made, to goodwill.

On
        April 2, 2004, we completed our acquisition of the remaining outstanding
        shares of PVS for an initial payment of approximately $75 million in cash.
        We may also be required to make earn-out payments in the future that are
        contingent upon PVS achieving certain performance-related milestones. PVS
        develops and manufactures guidewires and microcatheter technology for use
        in
        accessing the brain, the heart and other areas of the anatomy. The acquisition
        of PVS was intended to provide us with additional vascular access technology.

Contingent
        Consideration

Certain
        of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration.
        In
        accordance with Statement No. 142, we establish a contingent consideration
        liability at the acquisition date if the sum of the fair value assigned to
        assets acquired (including purchased research and development) and liabilities
        assumed exceed the initial cost of the acquired entity. The liability
        established equals the lesser of the maximum amount of the potential contingent
        consideration or the excess fair value. Payment of the additional consideration
        is generally contingent upon the acquired companies’ reaching certain
        performance milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving
        product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals.

During
        2006, we paid $397 million for acquisition-related payments associated primarily
        with Advanced Bionics, CryoVascular and Smart Therapeutics, Inc. As of
        December 31, 2006, we had accrued approximately $220 million for
        acquisition-related payments, of which we paid approximately $200 million
        to the former shareholders of Advanced Bionics during the first quarter of
        2007.
        During 2005, we paid $33 million for acquisition-related payments
        associated primarily with Catheter Innovations, Inc., Smart and Embolic
        Protection, Inc. (EPI). As of December 31, 2005, we had accrued
        $268 million for acquisition-related payments. In addition, as of
        December 31, 2005, we had recorded a liability of $89 million to
        account for the excess of


[Table
            of Contents]

the
        fair
        value of the assets acquired over the initial purchase price for certain
        of our
        acquisitions. During 2004, we paid $107 million for acquisition-related
        payments associated primarily with EPI, Smart and InFlow Dynamics, Inc.

Certain
        earn-out payments are based on multiples of the acquired company’s revenue
        during the earn-out period and, consequently, we cannot currently determine
        the
        total payments. However, we have developed an estimate of the maximum potential
        contingent consideration for each of our acquisitions with an outstanding
        earn-out obligation. At December 31, 2006, the estimated maximum potential
        amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be
        required to make associated with our business combinations is approximately
        $4 billion, some of which may be payable in common stock, and which
        includes approximately $3 billion of estimated payments to Advanced Bionics.
        The
        milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in
        certain future periods ranging from 2007 through 2016. The estimated cumulative
        specified revenue level associated with these maximum future contingent payments
        is approximately $10 billion, which includes approximately $7 billion for
        Advanced Bionics.

During
        the first quarter of 2007, we acquired EndoTex Interventional
        Systems, Inc., a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic
        lesions in the carotid arteries. We issued approximately five million shares
        valued at approximately $90 million and approximately $10 million in cash
        to
        acquire the remaining interests of EndoTex and may be required to pay future
        consideration that is contingent upon EndoTex achieving certain
        performance-related milestones.

Purchased
        Research and Development

During
        2006, we recorded $4.119 billion of purchased research and development. This
        amount included a charge of approximately $4.169 billion associated with
        the
        purchased research and development obtained in conjunction with the Guidant
        acquisition; a credit of approximately $67 million resulting primarily from
        the
        reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the
        TriVascular AAA program; and an expense of approximately $17 million resulting
        primarily from the application of equity method accounting for our investment
        in
        EndoTex.

The
        $4.169 billion of purchased research and development associated with the
        Guidant
        acquisition consists primarily of approximately $3.26 billion for acquired
        CRM-related products and approximately $540 million for drug-eluting stent
        technology shared with Abbott. The purchased research and development value
        associated with the Guidant acquisition also includes approximately $369
        million
        that represents the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments
        of
        up to $500 million that we may receive from Abbott upon receipt of certain
        regulatory approvals by the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions
        businesses it acquired from Guidant. We recorded the amounts as purchased
        research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the
        payments is dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory
        approvals, and the asset has no alternative future use as of the acquisition
        date. We will recognize the milestone payments, if received, as a gain in
        our
        financial statements at the time of receipt.

The
        most
        significant purchased research and development projects acquired from Guidant
        include the Frontier

™

CRM
        technology and rights to the everolimus-eluting stent technology that we
        share with Abbott. The Frontier CRM technology represents Guidant’s
        next-generation pulse generator platform that will incorporate new components
        and software while leveraging


[Table
            of Contents]

certain
        existing intellectual property, technology, manufacturing know-how and
        institutional knowledge of Guidant. We expect to leverage this platform across
        all CRM product lines to treat electrical dysfunction in the heart. We expect
        to
        launch various Frontier-based products commercially in the U.S. over the
        next
        36 months, subject to regulatory approval.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, we estimate that the total cost to complete the Frontier
        CRM
        technology is between $150 million and $200 million. We expect material cash
        flows from Frontier-based products to commence in 2008.

The
        $540
        million attributable to the everolimus-eluting stent technology represents
        the
        estimated fair value of the rights to Guidant’s everolimus-based drug-eluting
        stent technology we share with Abbott. In December 2006, we launched PROMUS

™

, our
        first-generation everolimus-based stent, supplied by Abbott, in limited
        quantities in Europe. We expect to launch a first-generation everolimus-based
        stent, supplied by Abbott, in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory approval.
        We expect to launch an internally manufactured next-generation everolimus-based
        stent in Europe in 2010 and in the U.S. in 2011. We expect that material
        net
        cash inflows (net of operating costs, including research and development
        costs
        to complete) from our internally manufactured everolimus-based drug-eluting
        stent will commence in 2010 or 2011, following its approval in Europe and
        in the
        U.S. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that the cost to complete our
        next-generation everolimus-eluting stent technology project is between $200
        million and $250 million. The in-process projects acquired in conjunction
        with
        the Guidant acquisition are generally progressing in line with our estimates
        as
        of the acquisition date.

In
        2005,
        we recorded $276 million of purchased research and development. Our 2005
        purchased research and development consisted of: $130 million relating to
        our
        acquisition of TriVascular; $73 million relating to our acquisition of AST;
        $45
        million relating to our acquisition of Rubicon; and $3 million relating to
        our
        acquisition of CryoVascular. In addition, we recorded $25 million of purchased
        research and development in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights
        for
        new brain monitoring technology that Aspect Medical Systems, one of our
        strategic partners, is currently developing. This technology is designed
        to aid
        the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimer’s disease and other
        neurological conditions.

The
        most
        significant 2005 purchased research and development projects included
        TriVascular’s AAA stent-graft and AST’s Petal™ bifurcation stent, which
        collectively represented 73 percent of our 2005 purchased research and
        development. During the second quarter of 2006, management cancelled the
        TriVascular AAA stent-graft program.

AST’s
        Petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel where
        a
        single vessel branches into two vessels, permitting blood to flow into both
        branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction. We estimate
        the remaining cost to complete the Petal bifurcation stent to be between
        $100 million and $125 million. We expect material net cash inflows
        from the Petal bifurcation stent to begin in 2011, which is when we expect
        the
        stent to be commercially available in the U.S. in a drug-eluting configuration.
        The AST Petal bifurcation stent in-process project is generally progressing
        in
        line with our estimates as of the acquisition date.

In
        2004,
        we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004
        purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating
        to our acquisitions of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our
        acquisition of PVS. The most significant in-process projects acquired in
        connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced Bionics’ bion®
microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which collectively represented
        77 percent of our


[Table
            of Contents]

        acquired in-process projects’ value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable
        neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions.
        We estimate the remaining cost to complete the bion microstimulator for migraine
        headaches to be approximately $35 million. We expect material cash flows
        from the bion microstimulator to commence in 2011, following its approval
        in the
        U.S., which we expect to occur in 2010. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery
        pump
        is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. We estimate
        the remaining cost to complete the drug delivery pump to be between
        $50 million and $60 million. We continue to assess the pace and risk of
        development of the drug delivery pump, as well as general market opportunities
        for the pump, which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval
        or lower potential market value. We currently expect material net cash inflows
        from the drug delivery pump to commence in 2012, following its approval in
        the
        U.S., which we expect to occur in 2011 or 2012. The estimated timing and
        costs
        to complete the bion microstimulator and the drug delivery pump have
        increased relative to what we estimated as of the acquisition date; however,
        we
        do not believe these increases will have a material impact on our results
        of
        operations or financial condition.

Note E—Goodwill
        and Other Intangible Assets

The
        gross
        carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets and the related accumulated
        amortization for intangible assets subject to amortization at December 31
        are as follows:

Our
        core
        technology that is not subject to amortization represents technical processes,
        intellectual property and/or institutional understanding acquired through
        business combinations that is fundamental to the ongoing operation of our
        business and has no limit to its useful life. Our core technology that is
        not
        subject to amortization is comprised primarily of certain purchased stent
        and
        balloon technology, which is foundational to our continuing operation within
        the
        interventional cardiology market and other markets within interventional
        medicine. We amortize all other core technology over its estimated useful
        life.

Estimated
        amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years based upon
        our
        intangible asset portfolio at December 31, 2006 is as follows:


[Table
            of Contents]

Goodwill
        as of December 31 as allocated by our reportable segments is as follows:

The
        and 2005 purchase price adjustments relate primarily to adjustments to reflect
        the fair value of deferred tax assets and liabilities acquired in connection
        with current year and prior year acquisitions properly.

Note F—Borrowings
        and Credit Arrangements

We
        had
        outstanding borrowings of $8.902 billion at December 31, 2006 at a weighted
        average interest rate of 6.03 percent as compared to outstanding borrowings
        of $2.02 billion at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average interest
        rate of 4.8 percent. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our borrowings
        consisted of the following:

Represents
                  unamortized (losses) gains on interest rate swaps used to hedge
                  the fair
                  value of certain of our senior notes. See

Note
                  G - Financial Instruments

for further discussion regarding the treatment of our interest
                  rate
                  swaps.

The
        debt
        maturity schedule for our term loan, Abbott loan, and senior notes as of
        December 31, 2006 is as follows:

Guidant
        Financing

In
        April
        2006, to finance the cash portion of the Guidant acquisition, we borrowed
        $6.6
        billion, consisting of a $5.0 billion five-year term loan and a $700 million
        364-day interim credit facility loan from a syndicate of commercial and
        investment banks, as well as a $900 million subordinated loan from Abbott.
        In
        addition, we terminated our existing revolving credit facilities and established
        a new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. In May 2006, we repaid and
        terminated the $700 million 364-day interim credit facility loan. We are
        permitted to prepay the term loan and Abbott loan prior to maturity with
        no
        penalty or premium.

The
        term
        loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest
        margin of 0.725 percent. The interest margin is based on the highest two
        out of
        three of our long-term, senior unsecured, corporate credit ratings from Fitch
        Ratings, Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating
        Services (S&P). As of December 31, 2006, our credit ratings were BBB from
        Fitch; Baa3 from Moody’s; and BBB from S&P. These credit ratings are
        investment grade. The Moody’s and S&P ratings outlook is currently
        negative.

The
        $900
        million loan from Abbott bears interest at a fixed 4.0 percent, payable
        semi-annually. We determined that an appropriate fair market interest rate
        on
        the loan from Abbott is 5.25


[Table
            of Contents]

percent
        per annum. We recorded the loan at a discount of approximately $50 million
        and
        will record interest at an imputed rate of 5.25 percent over the term of
        the
        loan.

Additionally,
        in June 2006, under our shelf registration previously filed with the SEC,
        we
        issued $1.2 billion of publicly registered senior notes. See the

Senior
        Notes

section
        of this note for the terms of this issuance.

Our
        revolving credit facility and term loan agreement requires that we maintain
        a
        ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, of less than
        or
        equal to 4.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2007 and 3.5 to 1.0 thereafter.
        The
        agreement also requires that we maintain a ratio of pro forma EBITDA, as
        defined
        by the agreement, to interest expense of greater than or equal to 3.0 to
        1.0. As
        of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with both of these debt covenants.
        Exiting 2006, our ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA was 3.6 to 1.0 and the
        ratio
        of pro forma EBITDA to interest expense was 5.6 to 1.0. Any breach of these
        covenants would require that we obtain waivers from our lenders and there
        can be
        no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers.

Credit
        Facilities

At
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, our revolving credit facilities totaled
        approximately $2.0 billion. Use of the borrowings is unrestricted and the
        borrowings are unsecured. Our credit facilities provide borrowing capacity
        and
        support our commercial paper program. In March 2006, we repaid $149 million
        in
        commercial paper borrowings that were outstanding at December 31, 2005 at a
        weighted average interest rate of 4.11 percent. In September 2005, we
        repaid 45 billion Japanese yen (approximately $400 million) in credit
        facility borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of
        0.37 percent.

We
        maintain a credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables
        that terminates in 2007. During the first quarter of 2006, we increased this
        facility from $100 million to $350 million. Borrowing availability
        under this facility changes based upon the amount of eligible receivables,
        concentration of eligible receivables and other factors. Certain significant
        changes in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings
        immediately under the facility. The credit agreement required us to create
        a
        wholly owned entity, which we consolidate. This entity purchases our U.S.
        trade
        accounts receivable and then borrows from two third-party financial institutions
        using these receivables as collateral. The receivables and related borrowings
        remain on our consolidated balance sheets because we have the right to prepay
        any borrowings outstanding and effectively retain control over the receivables.
        Accordingly, pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable,
        net,
        while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on our consolidated
        balance sheets.

There
        were no amounts outstanding against our available credit lines of $2.35 billion
        at December 31, 2006.

In
        addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese
        banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up
        to
        15 billion Japanese yen (translated to approximately $127 million at
        December 31, 2006 and 2005). We discounted $103 million of notes
        receivable as of December 31, 2006 and $109 million as of
        December 31, 2005 at an average interest rate of
        0.75 percent.

At
        December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees
        of
        approximately $90 million, which consisted primarily of financial lines of
        credit provided by banks and


[Table
            of Contents]

collateral
        for workers’ compensation programs. We enter these letters of credit and
        bank guarantees in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2006,
        we
        had not drawn any amounts on the letters of credit or guarantees. At this
        time,
        we do not believe we will be required to fund or draw any amounts from the
        guarantees or letters of credit and, accordingly, we have not recognized
        a
        related liability in our financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Our
        letters of credit and bank guarantees were immaterial at December 31,
        2005.

Senior
        Notes

We
        had
        senior notes of $3.05 billion outstanding at December 31, 2006 and
        $1.85 billion outstanding at December 31, 2005. These notes are
        publicly registered securities, which are redeemable prior to maturity and
        are
        not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured,
        unsubord

in

ated
        obligations and rank on a parity with each other. These notes rank junior
        to our secured debt, which include our $5.0 billion five-year term loan,
        and
        have senior priority to our subordinated indebtedness, which
        includes our $900 million note from Abbott. Our senior notes at December
        31, 2006 consist of the following:

In
        April
        2006, we increased the interest rate payable on our November 2015 and November
        2035 notes by 0.75 percent in connection with the downgrading of our credit
        ratings as a result of the Guidant acquisition. Subsequent rating improvements
        may result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate. The interest rate
        on the
        date these senior notes were originally issued will be permanently reinstated
        if
        and when the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either
        A-
        or A3 or higher.

Note G—Financial
        Instruments

Carrying
        amounts and fair values of our financial instruments at December 31 are as
        follows:


[Table
            of Contents]

Considerable
        judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of
        fair
        value. Estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
        that we could realize in a current market exchange due to changes in market
        rates since the reporting date.

Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging Activities

We
        develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and
        cash
        flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates
        and
        interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program
        that
        includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program
        pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter
        into
        derivative transactions for speculative purposes.

We
        estimate the fair value of derivative financial instruments based on the
        amount
        that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting
        date.
        We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amounts
        of
        $3.413 billion at December 31, 2006 and $3.593 billion at
        December 31, 2005. In addition, we had interest rate swap contracts
        outstanding in the notional amounts of $2.0 billion at December 31,
        2006 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase in the
        notional amount of our interest rate swaps is due to entering into $2.0 billion
        of hedge contracts related to our $5.0 billion five-year term loan during
        2006,
        offset by our termination of $1.1 billion in hedge contracts related to certain
        of our existing senior notes.

Currency
        Transaction Hedging

We
        manage
        our currency transaction exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage
        of
        offsetting transactions. We use foreign currency denominated borrowings and
        currency forward contracts to manage the majority of the remaining transaction
        exposure. These currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow,
        fair
        value or net investment hedges under Statement No. 133; are
        marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings; and are
        entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures,
        generally one to six months. These derivative instruments do not subject
        our
        earnings or cash flows to material risk since gains and losses on these
        derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the assets and liabilities
        being

hedged.
        Changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may
        impact our earnings and cash flows.

Currency
        Translation Hedging

We
        use
        currency forward and option contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings
        and
        cash flows, associated with forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany
        and third-party transactions, will be affected by currency exchange rate
        changes. Changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions
        may impact our earnings and cash flows. The success of the hedging program
        depends, in part, on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies
        (primarily Japanese yen, Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar
        and
        Canadian dollar). We may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains
        or
        losses to the extent that there are timing or permanent differences between
        forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility. We
        record
        the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the derivative
        instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, in other comprehensive income
        until
        the related third-party transaction occurs. Once the related third-party
        transaction occurs, we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain
        or
        loss on the cash flow hedge from other comprehensive income to earnings.
        In the
        event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable
        that it will not occur, we would reclassify the effective portion of any
        gain or
        loss on the


[Table
            of Contents]

related
        cash flow hedge from other comprehensive income to earnings at that time.
        Gains
        and losses from hedge ineffectiveness were immaterial in 2006, 2005 and 2004.
        We
        recognized a net gain of $38 million during 2006, a net loss of $12 million
        during 2005, and a net loss of $51 million during 2004 on hedge contracts
        that matured in accordance with our currency translation risk management
        program. All cash flow hedges outstanding at December 31, 2006 mature
        within the subsequent 36-month period. As of December 31, 2006,
        $28 million of net unrealized gains are recorded in accumulated other
        comprehensive income, net of tax, to recognize the effective portion of the
        fair
        value of any derivative instruments that are, or previously were, designated
        as
        foreign currency cash flow hedges as compared to $67 million of net
        unrealized gains at December 31, 2005.

At
        December 31, 2006, there are $22 million of net gains, net of tax,
        which we may reclassify to earnings within the next twelve months to mitigate
        foreign exchange risk.

Interest
        Rate Hedging

We
        use
        interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate
        movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting floating-rate debt
        into
        fixed-rate debt or fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. We designate
        these
        derivative instruments as either fair value or cash flow hedges under Statement
        No. 133. We record changes in the fair value of fair value hedges in other
        income and expense, which is offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged
        debt obligation to the extent the hedge is effective. Interest expense includes
        interest payments made or received under interest rate derivative instruments.
        We record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of cash flow
        hedges as other comprehensive income, net of tax, and reclassify the gains
        or
        losses to interest expense during the hedged interest payment period.

Prior
        to
        2006, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps indexed to six-month
        LIBOR to hedge against potential changes in the fair value of certain of
        our
        senior notes. We designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges
        under
        Statement No. 133 with changes in fair value recorded to earnings offset
        by
        changes in the fair value of our hedged senior notes. We terminated these
        hedges
        during 2006 and realized a net loss of $14 million, which we recorded to
        the
        carrying amount of certain of our senior notes. As of December 31, 2006,
        the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included $4 million of
        unamortized gains and $16 million of unamortized losses. As of
        December 31, 2005, the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes
        included $21 million of unrealized gains that we recorded as other
        long-term assets and $7 million of unrealized losses recorded as other
        long-term liabilities to recognize the fair value of the interest rate swaps.

During
        2006 and 2005, we entered into floating-to-fixed treasury locks to hedge
        against
        potential changes in future cash flows of certain senior note issuances.
        The
        objective of these hedges was to protect against variability of interest
        payments on the forecasted senior notes issuance. We designated these agreements
        as cash flow hedges under Statement No. 133. Upon termination of the treasury
        locks, we realized net gains of $21 million during 2006. We recorded
        approximately $11 million, net of tax, as other comprehensive income during
        2006, which we will amortize into earnings over the life of the hedged debt.
        During 2006, gains to earnings for ineffectiveness were immaterial. At December
        31, 2006, we recorded $12 million of unamortized gain, net of tax, related
        to
        these treasury locks. Amounts recorded in 2005 associated with treasury locks
        were immaterial.

During
        the year ended December 31, 2006, we entered into floating-to-fixed interest
        rate swaps indexed to three-month LIBOR to hedge against variability in interest
        payments on $2.0 billion of our $5.0 billion five-year term loan. Three-month
        LIBOR approximated 5.36 percent at


[Table
            of Contents]

December
        31, 2006. We designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under
        Statement No. 133 and, as such, we recorded the unrealized gains or losses
        as
        other comprehensive income, net of tax, until the hedged cash flow takes
        place.
        At December 31, 2006, we recorded a loss of $7 million, net of tax, in other
        comprehensive income to recognize the fair value of these swaps.

We
        recognized $2 million of net interest expense reductions related to
        interest rate derivative contracts in 2006 as compared to $9 million in
        2005 and $16 million in 2004.

Note H—Leases

Rent
        expense amounted to $80 million in 2006, $63 million in 2005, and
        $50 million in 2004.

Future
        minimum rental commitments at December 31, 2006 under noncancelable
        operating lease agreements are as follows:

In
        2005,
        we entered a lease agreement with an entity affiliated with a
        co-chief executive officer of our Neuromodulation division to construct
        a new manufacturing facility for that business. We were reimbursed for
        the first $12 million in construction costs and are responsible for all
        additional costs to complete and prepare the facility for occupancy. We estimate
        costs to complete the project to be approximately $45 million. Future lease
        payments over the remaining 14-year lease term are approximately $35 million.
        In
        addition, we have the option to purchase the facility after the first lease
        year.

Our
        obligations under noncancelable capital leases were immaterial as of
        December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005.

Note I—Income
        Taxes

Income
        before income taxes consists of the following:

The
        related provision for income taxes consists of the following:


[Table
            of Contents]

The
        reconciliation of income taxes at the federal statutory rate to the actual
        provision for income taxes is as follows:

Significant
        components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 are as
        follows:


[Table
            of Contents]

At
        December 31, 2006, we had U.S. tax net operating loss, capital loss and tax
        credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which was $88 million. In addition,
        we had foreign tax net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, the
        tax
        effect of which was $100 million. These carryforwards will expire
        periodically beginning in 2007. We established a valuation allowance of
        $97 million against these carryforwards due to our determination, after
        consideration of all evidence, both positive and negative, that it is more
        likely than not that the carryforwards will not be realized. The increase
        in the
        valuation allowance from 2005 to 2006 is attributable primarily to foreign
        net
        operating losses generated during the year.

The
        income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other
        comprehensive income was a benefit of $27 million in 2006, a provision of
        $82 million in 2005 and a benefit of $30 million in 2004.

We
        do not
        provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where
        we
        have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It
        is not
        practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings
        that
        are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of
        our
        foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are
        $7.186 billion at December 31, 2006 and $2.106 billion at
        December 31, 2005.


[Table
            of Contents]

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, we had recorded a $133 million deferred tax liability
        for
        unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we had anticipated
        repatriating in the foreseeable future. During 2006, we made a significant
        acquisition that, when combined with certain changes in business conditions
        subsequent to the acquisition, resulted in a reevaluation of this liability.
        We
        have determined that we will not repatriate these earnings in the foreseeable
        future and, instead, will indefinitely reinvest these earnings in foreign
        operations in order to repay debt obligations associated with the acquisition.
        As a result, we reversed the deferred tax liability and reduced income tax
        expense by $133 million in 2006.

During
        the first quarter of 2005, we repatriated $1.046 billion in extraordinary
        dividends, as defined in the American Jobs Creation Act, from our non-U.S.
        operations. The American Jobs Creation Act, enacted in October 2004, created
        a
        temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income
        earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends-received deduction for
        certain dividends from controlled foreign operations. In 2005, we repatriated
        earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries for which we had previously accrued tax
        liabilities. The resulting tax liabilities associated with this repatriation
        were $127 million.

Note J—Commitments
        and Contingencies

The
        medical device market in which we primarily participate is in large part
        technology driven. Physician customers, particularly in interventional
        cardiology, move quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result,
        intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play
        a
        significant role in product development and differentiation. However,
        intellectual property litigation to defend or create market advantage is
        inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts frequently
        overturn lower court patent decisions.

In
        addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent
        portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance
        risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors
        are
        parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or
        litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently
        drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending
        and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary
        and
        injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally
        not determined until the conclusion of the proceedings and are frequently
        modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult
        to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of
        other
        cases in other geographies.

Several
        third parties have asserted that our current and former stent systems infringe
        patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that stent
        systems
        or other products sold by these companies infringe patents owned or licensed
        by
        us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit
        our ability to sell certain stent products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce
        our operating margin on the sale of these products.

We
        are
        substantially self-insured with respect to general, product liability and
        securities claims. In the normal course of business, product liability and
        securities claims are asserted against us. In connection with the acquisition
        of
        Guidant, the number of product liability claims and other legal proceedings
        filed against us, including private securities litigation and shareholder
        derivative suits, significantly increased. Product liability and securities
        claims against us may be asserted in the future related to events not known
        to
        management at the present time. The absence of significant third-party insurance
        coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse
        decisions. Product liability claims, product recalls,


[Table
            of Contents]

securities
        litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of their outcome,
        could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
        operations or liquidity.

Our
        accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $485 million
        at December 31, 2006 and $35 million at December 31, 2005. The amounts
        accrued at December 31, 2006 represent primarily accrued legal defense costs
        related to assumed Guidant litigation and product liability claims recorded
        as
        part of the purchase price. In connection with the acquisition of Guidant,
        we
        are still assessing certain assumed litigation and product liability claims
        to
        determine the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of
        such
        claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued in
        the
        future. See

        Significant Accounting Policies

for
        further discussion on our policy for accounting for legal, product liability
        and
        security claims.

In
        management’s opinion, we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings
        other than those specifically identified below, which, individually or in
        the
        aggregate, could have a material effect on our financial condition, operations
        and/or cash flows.

Unless
        included in our accrual as of December 31, 2006 or otherwise indicated below,
        a
        range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding can
        not
        be estimated.

In
        connection with Abbott’s acquisition of Guidant’s vascular intervention and
        endovascular solutions businesses, it assumed all liabilities of Guidant
        and its
        affiliates to the extent relating to these businesses and agreed to indemnify
        Guidant and its affiliates from any losses arising out of or relating to
        the
        businesses and the assumed liabilities. As a result, certain legal proceedings
        related to the businesses to which Guidant and/or its affiliates are a party
        have been assumed by and are the responsibility of Abbott. These proceedings
        are
        not expected to have a material impact on us and are not described
        herein.

Litigation
        with Johnson & Johnson

On
        October 22, 1997, Cordis Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson, filed a suit for patent infringement against us and SCIMED Life
        Systems, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, alleging that the importation
        and use of the NIR® stent infringes two patents owned by Cordis. On
        April 13, 1998, Cordis filed a suit for patent infringement against us and
        SCIMED alleging that our NIR® stent infringes two additional patents owned by
        Cordis. The suits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District
        of
        Delaware seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief and that the patents
        be
        adjudged valid, enforceable and infringed. A trial on both actions was held
        in
        late 2000. A jury found that the NIR® stent does not infringe three Cordis
        patents, but does infringe one claim of one Cordis patent and awarded damages
        of
        approximately $324 million to Cordis. On March 28, 2002, the Court set
        aside the damage award, but upheld the remainder of the verdict, and held
        that
        two of the four patents had been obtained through inequitable conduct in
        the
        U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. On May 27, 2005, Cordis filed an appeal
        on
        those two patents and an appeal hearing was held on May 3, 2006.  The Court
        of Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court for further briefing
        and fact-finding by the Court.  On May 16, 2002, the Court also set
        aside the verdict of infringement, requiring a new trial. On March 24,
        2005, in a second trial, a jury found that a single claim of the Cordis patent
        was valid and infringed. The jury determined liability only; any monetary
        damages will be determined at a later trial. On March 27, 2006, the judge
        entered judgment in favor of Cordis, and on April 26, 2006, we filed an appeal.
        A hearing on the appeal has not yet been scheduled.  Even though it is
        reasonably possible that the we may incur a liability associated with this
        case,
        we do not believe that a loss is probable or estimable. Therefore, we have
        not
        accrued for any losses associated with this case.


[Table
            of Contents]

On
        April 2, 1997, Ethicon and other Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries
        filed a cross-border proceeding in The Netherlands alleging that the NIR® stent
        infringes a European patent licensed to Ethicon. In this action, the
        Johnson & Johnson entities requested relief, including provisional
        relief (a preliminary injunction). In October 1997, Johnson &
Johnson’s request for provisional cross-border relief on the patent was denied
        by the Dutch Court, on the ground that it is “very likely” that the NIR® stent
        will be found not to infringe the patent. Johnson & Johnson’s appeal of
        this decision was denied. In January 1999, Johnson & Johnson
        amended the claims of the patent and changed the action from a cross-border
        case
        to a Dutch national action. On June 23, 1999, the Dutch Court affirmed that
        there were no remaining infringement claims with respect to the patent and
        also
        asked the Dutch Patent Office for technical advice about the validity of
        the
        amended patent. In late 1999, Johnson & Johnson appealed this decision.
        On March 11, 2004, the Court of Appeals nullified the Dutch Court’s
        June 23, 1999 decision and the proceedings have been returned to the Dutch
        Court. In accordance with its 1999 decision, the Dutch Court asked the Dutch
        Patent Office for technical advice on the validity of the amended patent.
        On
        August 31, 2005, the Dutch Patent Office issued its technical advice that
        the amended patent was valid but left certain legal issues for the Dutch
        Court
        to resolve. At this time, no further proceedings have occurred in the Dutch
        Court.

On
        August 22, 1997, Johnson & Johnson filed a suit for patent
        infringement against Boston Scientific alleging that the sale of the NIR® stent
        infringes certain Canadian patents owned by Johnson & Johnson. Suit was
        filed in the federal court of Canada seeking a declaration of infringement,
        monetary damages and injunctive relief. On December 2, 2004, the Court
        dismissed the case, finding all patents to be invalid. On December 6, 2004,
        Johnson & Johnson appealed the Court’s decision, and in May 2006, the
        Court reinstated the patent. In August 2006, we appealed the Court’s decision to
        the Supreme Court. On January 18, 2007, the Supreme Court denied review.
        A trial
        has not yet been scheduled.

On
        February 14, 2002, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, filed suit for
        patent infringement against Johnson & Johnson and Cordis alleging that
        certain balloon catheters and stent delivery systems sold by Johnson &
Johnson and Cordis infringe five U.S. patents owned by Boston Scientific.
        The
        complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
        of
        California seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On October 15, 2002,
        Cordis filed a counterclaim alleging that certain balloon catheters and stent
        delivery systems sold by Boston Scientific infringe three U.S. patents owned
        by
        Cordis and seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On December 6, 2002, we
        filed an amended complaint alleging that two additional patents owned by
        us are
        infringed by the Cordis products. A bench trial on interfering patent issues
        was
        held December 5, 2005 and on September 19, 2006, the Court found there to
        be no interference. Trial is scheduled to begin on October 9, 2007.

On
        March 26, 2002, we and Target Therapeutics, Inc., our wholly owned
        subsidiary, filed suit for patent infringement against Cordis alleging that
        certain detachable coil delivery systems and /or pushable coil vascular
        occlusion systems (coil delivery systems) infringe three U.S. patents, owned
        by
        or exclusively licensed to Target. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District
        Court for the Northern District of California seeking monetary and injunctive
        relief. In 2004, the Court granted summary judgement in our favor finding
        infringement of one of the patents.  On November 14, 2005, the Court
        denied Cordis’ summary judgment motions with respect to the validity of the


[Table
            of Contents]

patent.
        Cordis filed a motion for reconsideration and a hearing was held on October
        26,
        2006. The Court ruled on Cordis’ motion for reconsideration by modifying its
        claim construction order. On February 9, 2007, Cordis filed a motion for
        summary
        judgment of non-infringement with respect to one of the patents and a hearing
        on
        Cordis’ motion is scheduled for March 22, 2007. A trial has not yet been
        scheduled.

On
        January 13, 2003, Cordis filed suit for patent infringement against Boston
        Scientific and SCIMED alleging that our Express


™
        coronary stent infringes a U.S. patent owned by Cordis. The suit was filed
        in
        the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware seeking monetary and
        injunctive relief. We answered the complaint, denying the allegations and
        filed
        a counterclaim alleging that certain Cordis products infringe a patent owned
        by
        us. On August 4, 2004, the Court granted a Cordis motion to add our
        Liberté™ coronary stent and two additional patents to the complaint. On
        June 21, 2005, a jury found that our TAXUS® Express


™,
        Express


,
        Express™ Biliary, and Liberté stents infringe a Johnson & Johnson
        patent and that the Liberté stent infringes a second Johnson & Johnson
        patent. The juries only determined liability; monetary damages will be
        determined at a later trial. We filed a motion to set aside the verdict and
        enter judgment in its favor as a matter of law. On May 11, 2006, our motion
        was
        denied. With respect to our counterclaim, a jury found on July 1, 2005,
        that Johnson & Johnson’s Cypher®, Bx Velocity®, Bx Sonic™ and Genesis™
stents infringe our patent. Johnson & Johnson filed a motion to set
        aside the verdict and enter judgment in its favor as a matter of law. On
        May 11,
        2006, the Court denied Johnson & Johnson’s motion. Johnson & Johnson has
        moved for reconsideration of the Court’s decision. Even though it is reasonably
        possible that we will incur a liability associated with this case, we do
        not
        believe that a loss is probable or estimable. Therefore, we have not accrued
        for
        any losses associated with this case.

On
        March 13, 2003, we, and Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc., filed suit for
        patent infringement against Johnson & Johnson and Cordis, alleging that
        its Cypher drug-eluting stent infringes one of our patents. The suit was
        filed
        in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware seeking monetary
        and
        injunctive relief. Cordis answered the complaint, denying the allegations,
        and
        filed a counterclaim against us alleging that the patent is not valid and
        is
        unenforceable. We subsequently filed amended and new complaints in the U.S.
        District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Cypher
        drug-eluting stent infringes four of our additional patents (“Additional
        Patents”). Following the announcement on February 23, 2004 by Guidant
        Corporation of an agreement with Johnson & Johnson and Cordis to sell
        the Cypher drug-eluting stent, we amended our complaint to include Guidant
        and
        certain of its subsidiaries as co-defendants as to certain patents in
        suit.  We may replace Abbott for Guidant as a party in the suit as a
        result of Abbott’s purchase of Guidant’s vascular interventions and endovascular
        solutions businesses.  In March 2005, we filed a stipulated dismissal
        as to three of the four Additional Patents. On July 1, 2005, a jury found
        that Johnson & Johnson’s Cypher drug-eluting stent infringes one of our
        patents and upheld the validity of the patent. The jury determined liability
        only; any monetary damages will be determined at a later trial. Johnson &
Johnson filed a motion to set aside the verdict and enter judgment in its
        favor
        as a matter of law. On June 15, 2006, the Court denied Johnson & Johnson’s
        motion. Johnson & Johnson has moved for reconsideration of the Court’s
        decision. A summary judgment hearing as to the remaining patent was held
        on June
        14, 2006. A trial regarding infringement and validity of the remaining patent
        has not yet been scheduled.

On
        December 24, 2003, we (through our subsidiary Schneider Europe GmbH) filed
        suit against the Belgian subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson, Cordis and
        Janssen Pharmaceutica alleging that Cordis’ Bx Velocity stent, Bx Sonic® stent,
        Cypher stent, Cypher Select stent, Aqua T3™ balloon and U-Pass balloon infringe
        one of our European patents. The suit was filed in the


[Table
            of Contents]

District
        Court of Brussels, Belgium seeking preliminary cross-border, injunctive and
        monetary relief and sought an expedited review of the claims by the Court.
        A
        separate suit was filed in the District Court of Brussels, Belgium against
        nine
        additional Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries. The Belgium Court linked all
        Johnson & Johnson entities into a single action but dismissed the case
        for failure to satisfy the requirements for expedited review without commenting
        on the merits of the claims. On August 5, 2004, we refiled the suit on the
        merits against the same Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries in the District
        Court of Brussels, Belgium seeking cross-border, injunctive and monetary
        relief
        for infringement of the same European patent. A hearing has not yet been
        scheduled. In December 2005, the Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries
        filed a nullity action in France and, in January 2006, the same
        Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries filed nullity actions in Italy and
        Germany. We have filed a counterclaim infringement action in Italy.

On
        May 12, 2004, we filed suit against two of Johnson &
Johnson’s Dutch subsidiaries, alleging that Cordis’ Bx Velocity stent, Bx Sonic
        stent, Cypher stent, Cypher Select stent, and Aqua T3 balloon delivery systems
        for those stents, and U-Pass angioplasty balloon catheters infringe one of
        our
        European patents. The suit was filed in the District Court of The Hague in
        The
        Netherlands seeking injunctive and monetary relief. On June 8, 2005, the
        Court found the Johnson & Johnson products infringe our patent and
        granted injunctive relief. On June 23, 2005, the District Court in Assen.
        The Netherlands stayed enforcement of the injunction. On October 12, 2005,
        a Dutch Court of Appeals overturned the Assen court’s ruling and reinstated the
        injunction against the manufacture, use and sale of the Cordis products in The
        Netherlands. Damages for Cordis’ infringing acts in The Netherlands will be
        determined at a later date. Cordis’ appeal of the validity and infringement
        ruling by The Hague Court remains pending. A hearing on this appeal was held
        on
        November 2, 2006 and a decision is expected on March 15, 2007.

On
        September 27, 2004, our wholly owned subsidiary, Boston Scientific
        Scimed, Inc., filed suit against a German subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson alleging the Cypher drug-eluting stent infringes one of our European
        patents. The suit was filed in Mannheim, Germany seeking monetary and injunctive
        relief. A hearing was held on April 1, 2005 and on July 15, 2005, the
        Court indicated that it would appoint a technical expert. The expert’s opinion
        was submitted to the Court on September 19, 2006. A final hearing has not
        yet
        been scheduled.

On
        October 15, 2004, our wholly owned subsidiary, Boston Scientific
        Scimed, Inc., filed suit against a German subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson alleging the Cypher drug-eluting stent infringes one of our German
        utility models. The suit was filed in Mannheim, Germany seeking monetary
        and
        injunctive relief. A hearing was held on April 1, 2005 and on July 15,
        2005, the Court indicated that it would appoint a technical expert. The expert’s
        opinion was submitted to the Court on September 19, 2006. A final hearing
        has
        not yet been scheduled.

On
        December 30, 2004, our wholly owned subsidiary, Boston Scientific
        Scimed, Inc., filed suit against a German subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson alleging the Cypher drug-eluting stent infringes one of our German
        utility models. The suit was filed in Dusseldorf, Germany seeking monetary
        and
        injunctive relief. A hearing was held on December 1, 2005. In
        January 2006, the judge rendered a decision of non-infringement. On
        January 29, 2006, Scimed appealed the judge’s decision. On February 15,
        2007, the Court decided to appoint a technical expert. A hearing date has
        not
        yet been scheduled.

On
        September 25, 2006, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against us, Guidant
        and Abbott in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
        The
        complaint alleges that Guidant breached certain provisions of the amended
        merger
        agreement between Johnson & Johnson and Guidant (Merger Agreement) as well
        as the implied duty of good faith and fair


[Table
            of Contents]

dealing.
        The complaint further alleges that we and Abbott tortiously interfered with
        the
        Merger Agreement by inducing Guidant’s breach. The complaint seeks certain
        factual findings, damages in an amount no less than $5.5 billion and attorneys’
fees and costs. We and Guidant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on
        November 15, 2006. Johnson & Johnson filed its opposition to the motion on
        January 9, 2007, and defendants filed their reply on January 31, 2007. A
        hearing
        on the motion to dismiss was held on February 28, 2007. The judge took
        the matter under advisement, and stayed discovery pending his decision on
        the
        motion.

On
        February 1, 2005, we and Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed suit
        against Conor Medsystems, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, in The
        Hague, The Netherlands seeking a declaration that Conor’s drug-eluting stent
        products infringe patents owned by Angiotech and licensed to us. A hearing
        was
        held on October 27, 2006, and a decision was rendered on January 17, 2007
        in
        favor of Angiotech and us.

On
        May 4,
        2006, we filed suit against Conor Medsystems Ireland Ltd. alleging that its
        Costar

®

paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system infringes our balloon catheter patent.
        The suit was filed in Ireland seeking monetary and injunctive relief.  On
        May 24, 2006, Conor responded, denying the allegations and filed a counterclaim
        against us alleging that the patent is not valid and is unenforceable.

On
        November 8, 2005, we and Scimed filed suit against Conor alleging that
        certain of Conor’s stent and drug-coated stent products infringe a patent owned
        by us. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District
        of
        Delaware seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On December 30, 2005,
        Conor answered the complaint, denying the allegations. Trial is expected
        to
        begin on October 15, 2007.

Litigation
        with Medtronic, Inc.

On
        March
        1, 2006, Medtronic Vascular filed suit against us and SCIMED alleging that
        our
        balloon products infringe four U.S. patents owned by Medtronic Vascular.
        The
        suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
        seeking monetary and injunctive relief.


[Table
            of Contents]

On
        April
        25, 2006, we answered and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment
        of
        invalidity and non-infringement. Trial is scheduled to begin on May 5,
        2008.

Litigation
        Relating to St. Jude Medical, Inc.

On
        February 2, 2004, Guidant, Guidant Sales Corp. (GSC), Cardiac Pacemakers,
        Inc. (CPI) and Mirowski Family Ventures LLC filed a declaratory judgment
        action
        in the District Court for Delaware against St. Jude Medical and Pacesetter
        Inc., a subsidiary of St. Jude Medical, alleging that their Epic HF, Atlas
        HF
        and Frontier 3x2 devices infringe a patent exclusively licensed to Guidant.
        Pursuant to a Settlement Agreement dated July 29, 2006 between us and St.
        Jude
        Medical, the parties have agreed to limit the scope and available remedies
        of
        this case. Trial is scheduled to begin on August 20, 2007.

GSC,
        CPI
        and Mirowski are plaintiffs in a patent infringement suit originally filed
        against St. Jude Medical and its affiliates in November 1996 in the District
        Court in Indianapolis. In July 2001, a jury found that a patent licensed
        to CPI
        and expired in December 2003, was valid but not infringed by certain of St.
        Jude
        Medical’s defibrillator products. In February 2002, the District Court reversed
        the jury’s finding of validity. In August 2004, the Federal Circuit Court of
        Appeals, among other things, reinstated the jury verdict of validity and
        remanded the matter for a new trial on infringement and damages. The case
        was
        sent back to the District Court for further proceedings. Pursuant to a
        Settlement Agreement dated July 29, 2006 between us and St. Jude Medical,
        the
        parties agreed to limit the scope and available remedies of this case. Trial
        is
        scheduled to begin on April 30, 2007.

Litigation
        with Medinol Ltd.

On
        February 20, 2006, Medinol submitted a request for arbitration against us,
        and our wholly owned subsidiaries Boston Scientific Ltd. and Boston
        Scientific Scimed, Inc., under the Arbitration Rules of the World
        Intellectual Property Organization pursuant to a settlement agreement between
        Medinol and us dated September 21, 2005. The request for arbitration
        alleges that the Company’s Liberté coronary stent system infringes two U.S.
        patents and one European patent owned by Medinol. Medinol is seeking to have
        the
        patents declared valid and enforceable and a reasonable royalty. The September
        2005 settlement agreement provides, among other things, that Medinol may
        only
        seek reasonable royalties and is specifically precluded from seeking injunctive
        relief. As a result, we do not expect the outcome of this proceeding to have
        a
        material impact on the continued sale of the Liberté™ stent system
        internationally or in the United States, the continued sale of the TAXUS®
Liberté™ stent system internationally or the launch of the TAXUS® Liberté™ stent
        system in the United States. We plan to defend against Medinol’s claims
        vigorously. The arbitration hearing is scheduled to begin on September 17,
        2007.

On
        September 25, 2002, we filed suit against Medinol alleging Medinol’s
        NIRFlex™ and NIRFlex™ Royal products infringe a patent owned by us. The suit was
        filed in the District Court of The Hague, The Netherlands seeking cross-border,
        monetary and injunctive relief. On September 10, 2003, the Dutch Court
        ruled that the patent was invalid. We appealed the Court’s decision in
        December 2003. A hearing on the appeal was held on August 17, 2006. On
        December 14, 2006, a decision was rendered upholding the trial court
        ruling.

On
          February 26, 2007, Medinol filed a Vindication Action against us in the
          German
          District Court of Munich, Germany. The complaint alleges, and seeks a ruling,
          that Medinol be deemed the owner of one of our patents covering coronary
          stent
          designs. We are in the process of evaluating this matter.

Other
        Patent Litigation

On
        September 12, 2002, ev3 Inc. filed suit against The Regents of the
        University of California and a subsidiary of ours in the District Court of
        The
        Hague, The Netherlands, seeking a declaration that ev3’s EDC II and VDS embolic
        coil products do not infringe three patents licensed to us from The Regents.
        On
        October 22, 2003, the Court ruled that the ev3 products infringe three
        patents licensed to us. On December 18, 2003, ev3 appealed the Court’s
        ruling. A hearing on the appeal has not yet been scheduled. A damages hearing
        is
        scheduled for June 15, 2007.

On
        March 29, 2005, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, Boston Scientific
        Scimed, Inc., filed suit against ev3 for patent infringement, alleging that
        ev3’s SpideRX™ embolic protection device infringes four U.S. patents owned by
        us. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of
        Minnesota seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On May 9, 2005, ev3
        answered the complaint, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim
        seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity and unenforceability, and
        noninfringement of our patents in the suit. On October 28, 2005, ev3 filed
        its
        first amended answer and counterclaim alleging that certain of our embolic
        protection devices infringe a patent owned by ev3. On June 20, 2006, we filed
        an
        amended complaint adding a claim of trade secret misappropriation and claiming
        infringement of two additional U.S. patents owned by us. On June 30, 2006,
        ev3
        filed an amended answer and counterclaim alleging infringement of two additional
        U.S. patents owned by ev3. A trial has not yet been scheduled.

On
        December 16, 2003, The Regents of the University of
        California filed suit against Micro Therapeutics, Inc., a subsidiary
        of ev3, and Dendron GmbH alleging that Micro Therapeutics’ Sapphire™ detachable
        coil delivery systems infringe twelve patents licensed to us and owned by
        The
        Regents. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
        District of California seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On
        January 8, 2004, Micro Therapeutics and Dendron filed a third-party
        complaint to include us and Target as third-party defendants seeking a
        declaratory judgment of invalidity and noninfringement with respect to the
        patents and antitrust violations. On February 17, 2004, we, as a
        third-party defendant, filed a motion to dismiss us from the case. On
        July 9, 2004, the Court granted our motion in part and dismissed us and
        Target from the claims relating only to patent infringement, while denying
        dismissal of an antitrust claim. On April 7, 2006, the Court denied Micro
        Therapeutics’ motion seeking unenforceability of The Regents’ patent and denied
        The Regents’ cross-motion for summary judgment of unenforceability. A trial has
        been scheduled for June 5, 2007.

On
        September 27, 2004, we and a subsidiary filed suit for patent infringement
        against Micrus Corporation alleging that certain detachable embolic coil
        devices
        infringe two U.S. patents exclusively licensed to the subsidiary. The complaint
        was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
        seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On November 16, 2004, Micrus
        answered and filed counterclaims seeking a declaration of invalidity,
        unenforceability and noninfringement and included allegations of infringement
        against us relating to three U.S. patents owned by Micrus, and antitrust
        violations. On January 10, 2005, we filed a motion to dismiss certain of
        Micrus’ counterclaims, and on February 23, 2005, the Court granted a
        request to stay the proceedings pending a reexamination of our patents by
        the
        U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. On February 23, 2006, the stay was lifted.
        Subsequently, Micrus provided a covenant not to sue us with respect to one
        of
        the Micrus patents. A trial date has not yet been set.

On
        November 26, 2005, we and Angiotech filed suit against Occam International,
        BV in The Hague, The Netherlands seeking a preliminary injunction against
        Occam’s drug-eluting stent


[Table
            of Contents]

products
        based on infringement of patents owned by Angiotech and licensed to us. A
        hearing was held January 13, 2006, and on January 27, 2006, the Court
        denied our request for a preliminary injunction. We and Angiotech have appealed
        the Court’s decision, and the parties plan to pursue normal infringement
        proceedings against Occam in The Netherlands.

On
        April 4, 2005, we and Angiotech filed suit against Sahajanand Medical
        Technologies Pvt. Ltd. in The Hague, The Netherlands seeking a declaration
        that Sahajanand’s drug-eluting stent products infringe patents owned by
        Angiotech and licensed to us. On May 3, 2006, the Court found that the asserted
        claims were infringed and valid, and provided for injunctive and monetary
        relief. On July 13, 2006, Sahajanand appealed the Court’s decision. A hearing on
        the appeal has not been scheduled.

On
        May 19, 2005, G. David Jang, M.D. filed suit against us alleging breach of
        contract relating to certain patent rights assigned to our covering stent
        technology. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Central District
        of
        California seeking monetary damages and rescission of the contract. On
        June 24, 2005, we answered, denying the allegations, and filed a
        counterclaim. After a Markman ruling relating to the Jang patent rights,
        Dr.
        Jang stipulated to the dismissal of certain claims alleged in the complaint
        with
        a right to appeal. In February 2007, the parties agreed to settle the other
        claims of the case.

On
        December 16, 2005, Bruce N. Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. filed suit against us
        alleging that our TAXUS® Express coronary stent system infringes a patent owned
        by Dr. Saffran. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
        Eastern District of Texas and seeks monetary and injunctive relief. On
        February 8, 2006, we filed an answer, denying the allegations of the
        complaint. Trial is expected to begin on January 3, 2008.

Other
        Proceedings

On
        January 10, 2002 and January 15, 2002, Alan Schuster and Antoinette
        Loeffler, respectively, putatively initiated shareholder derivative lawsuits
        for
        and on our behalf in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
        New
        York against the Company’s then current directors and us as nominal defendant.
        Both complaints allege, among other things, that with regard to our relationship
        with Medinol, the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to us and our
        shareholders in our management and affairs, and in the use and preservation
        of
        our assets. The suits seek a declaration of the directors’ alleged breach,
        damages sustained by us as a result of the alleged breach and monetary and
        injunctive relief. On October 18, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated
        amended complaint naming two senior officials as defendants and us as nominal
        defendant. The action was stayed in February 2003 pending resolution of a
        separate lawsuit brought by Medinol against us. After the resolution of the
        Medinol lawsuit, plaintiffs, on May 1, 2006, were permitted to file an amended
        complaint to supplement the allegations in the prior consolidated amended
        complaint based mainly on events that occurred subsequent to the parties’
agreement to stay the action. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
        amended complaint on or about June 30, 2006. The motion was denied without
        prejudice at a hearing on October 20, 2006, and the Court ordered that the
        amended complaint be deemed a demand for our Board of Directors to consider
        taking action in connection with the allegations of the amended complaint.
        The
        Court stayed the litigation until March 9, 2007.

On
          September 8, 2005, the Laborers Local 100 and 397 Pension Fund initiated a
          putative shareholder derivative lawsuit for and on behalf of Boston Scientific
          in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court Department for Middlesex
          County against our directors, certain of our current and former officers
          and
          Boston Scientific as nominal defendant. The complaint alleged, among other
          things, that with regard to certain matters of regulatory compliance, the
          defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Boston Scientific and its
          shareholders in the management and affairs of our business and in the use
          and
          preservation of our assets. The complaint also alleged that as a result
          of the
          alleged misconduct and the purported failure to publicly disclose material
          information, certain directors and officers sold our stock at inflated
          prices in
          violation of their fiduciary duties and were unjustly enriched. The suits sought
          a declaration of the directors’ and officers’ alleged breaches, unspecified
          damages sustained by us as a result of the alleged breaches and other
          unspecified equitable and injunctive relief. On September 15, 2005,
          Benjamin Roussey also initiated a putative shareholder derivative lawsuit
          in the
          same Court alleging similar misconduct and seeking similar relief. Following
          consolidation of the cases, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
          consolidated derivative complaint. Our motion to dismiss was granted without
          leave to amend on September 11, 2006. On September 21, 2006, plaintiff
          Laborers
          Local 100 and 397 Pension Fund filed a motion to alter or amend judgment
          and for
          leave to file an amended complaint which was denied on October 19, 2006.
          On
          February 17, 2007, the Board of Directors received two letters from the
          Laborers
          Local 100 and 397 Pension Fund demanding that the Board of Directors investigate
          and commence action against the defendants named in the original complaint
          in
          connection with the matters alleged in the original complaint. The second
          letter
          made a demand for an inspection of certain books and records for the purpose
          of,
          among other things, the investigation of possible breaches of fiduciary
          duty,
          misappropriation of information, abuse of control, gross mismanagement,
          waste of
          corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The Board of Directors and the
          Company
          are considering what actions should be taken in response to the
          letters.

On
        September 23, 2005, Srinivasan Shankar, on behalf of himself and all others
        similarly situated, filed a purported securities class action suit in the
        U.S.
        District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of those who
        purchased or otherwise acquired our securities during the period March 31,
        2003 through August 23, 2005, alleging that we and certain of our officers


[Table
            of Contents]

violated
        certain sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 28,
        2005, October 27, 2005, November 2, 2005 and November 3, 2005,
        Jack Yopp, Robert L. Garber, Betty C. Meyer and John Ryan, respectively,
        on
        behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, filed additional
        purported securities class action suits in the same Court on behalf of the
        same
        purported class. On February 15, 2006, the Court ordered that the five
        class actions be consolidated and appointed the Mississippi Public Employee
        Retirement System Group as lead plaintiff. A consolidated amended complaint
        was
        filed on April 17, 2006. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that
        we made
        material misstatements and omissions by failing to disclose the supposed
        merit
        of the Medinol litigation and DOJ investigation relating to the 1998 NIR
        ON®
Ranger with Sox stent recall, problems with the TAXUS® drug-eluting coronary
        stent systems that led to product recalls, and our ability to satisfy FDA
        regulations concerning medical device quality. The consolidated amended
        complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees. The
        defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on
        June
        8, 2006. A hearing on the motion was held on January 30, 2007.

On
        January 19, 2006, George Larson, on behalf of himself and all others
        similarly situated, filed a purported class action complaint in the U.S.
        District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of participants
        and
        beneficiaries of our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) and GESOP
        (together the Plans) alleging that we and certain of our officers and employees
        violated certain provisions under the Employee Retirement Income Security
        Act of
        1974, as amended (ERISA) and Department of Labor Regulations. On
        January 26, 2006, February 8, 2006, February 14, 2006,
        February 23, 2006 and March 3, 2006, Robert Hochstadt, Jeff Klunke, Kirk
        Harvey, Michael Lowe and Douglas Fletcher, respectively, on behalf of themselves
        and others similarly situated, filed purported class action complaints in
        the
        same Court on behalf of the participants and beneficiaries in our Plans alleging
        similar misconduct and seeking similar relief as in the Larson lawsuit. On
        April
        3, 2006, the Court issued an order consolidating the actions and appointing
        Jeffrey Klunke and Michael Lowe as interim lead plaintiffs. On August 23,
        2006,
        plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint that purports to bring a class
        action
        on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries of our 401(k) Plan during
        the
        period May 7, 2004 through January 26, 2006 alleging that we, our 401(k)
        Administrative and Investment Committee (the Committee), members of the
        Committee, and certain directors violated certain provisions of ERISA. The
        complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their
        fiduciary duties to the 401(k) Plan’s participants. The complaint seeks
        equitable and monetary relief. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October
        10, 2006. Plaintiffs filed their opposition memorandum on December 15,
        2006, and defendants filed their reply on January 16, 2007. A hearing has
        not yet been scheduled.

On
        January 26, 2006, Donald Wright filed a purported class action complaint in
        the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against us and Guidant
        on
        behalf of himself and all other senior citizens and handicapped persons
        similarly situated seeking a permanent injunction to prohibit us from completing
        its acquisition of Guidant, alleging violations of the Minnesota Fraudulent
        Transfers Act and Consumer Fraud Act. The complaint seeks restitution on
        behalf
        of those persons who suffered injury related to Guidant’s cardiac pacemakers
        and/or defibrillators. The complaint also seeks monetary damages and injunctive
        relief. Mr. Wright filed an amended complaint on February 21, 2006,
        dropping his claim for monetary damages.

We
          are a
          defendant in two lawsuits involving the TAXUS Express


paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system in which the plaintiffs are seeking
          class certification. On November 16, 2006, Michael Seaburn and Beatriz
          Seaburn
          filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida
          on
          behalf of themselves and a purported class of plaintiffs resident in the
          United
          States. On January 23, 2007, Ronald E. and Tammy Coterill filed suit in
          the U.S.
          District Court for the District of Idaho on behalf of themselves and a
          purported
          class of plaintiffs resident in the state of Idaho or any contiguous state.
          Both
          complaints seek certification of class status and also seek compensatory
          damages
          for personal injury, restitution of the purchase price, disgorgement of
          our
          profits associated with the sale of TAXUS stent systems, and, in the Idaho
          case,
          injunctive relief in the form of medical monitoring. We have answered both
          complaints and intend to vigorously defend against each of their
          allegations.

On
        June 12, 2003, Guidant announced that its subsidiary, EndoVascular
        Technologies, Inc. (EVT), had entered into a plea agreement with the U.S.
        Department of Justice relating to a previously disclosed investigation regarding
        the ANCURE ENDOGRAFT System for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
        At
        the time of the EVT plea, Guidant had outstanding fourteen suits alleging
        product liability related causes of action relating to the ANCURE System.


[Table
            of Contents]

Subsequent
        to the EVT plea, Guidant was notified of additional claims and served with
        additional complaints. From time to time, Guidant has settled certain of
        the
        individual claims and suits for amounts that were not material to Guidant.
        Currently, Guidant has approximately 18 suits outstanding, and more suits
        may be
        filed. Additionally, Guidant has been notified of over 150 unfiled claims
        that
        are pending. The cases generally allege the plaintiffs suffered injuries,
        and in
        certain cases died, as a result of purported defects in the device or the
        accompanying warnings and labeling. The complaints seek damages, including
        punitive damages.

While
        insurance may reduce Guidant’s exposure with respect to ANCURE claims, one of
        Guidant’s carriers, Allianz Insurance Company (Allianz), filed suit in the
        Circuit Court, State of Illinois, County of DuPage, seeking to rescind or
        otherwise deny coverage and alleging fraud. Additional carriers have intervened
        in the case and Guidant affiliates, including EVT, are also named as defendants.
        Guidant and its affiliates also have initiated suit against certain of its
        carriers, including Allianz, in the Superior Court, State of Indiana, County
        of
        Marion, in order to preserve Guidant’s rights to coverage. The lawsuits are
        virtually identical and proceeding in both state courts. A trial has not
        yet
        been scheduled in the Illinois case. A trial is expected to begin in late
        or early 2008 in the Indiana case.

Shareholder
        derivative suits relating to the ANCURE System are currently pending in the
        Southern District of Indiana and in the Superior Court of the State of Indiana,
        County of Marion. The suits, purportedly filed on behalf of Guidant, initially
        alleged that Guidant’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by taking
        improper steps or failing to take steps to prevent the ANCURE and EVT related
        matters described above. The complaints seek damages and other equitable
        relief.
        The state court derivative suits have been stayed in favor of the federal
        derivative action. Guidant moved to dismiss the federal derivative action.
        The
        plaintiff in the federal derivative case filed an amended complaint in December
        2005, adding allegations regarding defibrillator and pacemaker products and
        Guidant’s proposed merger with Johnson & Johnson. On January 23,
        2006, Guidant and its directors moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On
        March
        1, 2006, a second amended complaint in the federal derivative case was filed.
        On
        May 1, 2006, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint.
        This
        motion remains pending.

In
        July
        2005, a purported class action complaint was filed on behalf of participants
        in
        Guidant’s employee pension benefit plans. This action was filed in the U.S.
        District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Guidant and its
        directors. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty under the Employee
        Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1132. 
Specifically, the complaint alleges that Guidant fiduciaries concealed adverse
        information about Guidant’s defibrillators and imprudently made contributions to
        Guidant’s 401(k) plan and employee stock ownership plan in the form of Guidant
        stock. The complaint seeks class certification, declaratory and injunctive
        relief, monetary damages, the imposition of a constructive trust, and costs
        and
        attorneys’ fees. A second, similar complaint was filed and consolidated with the
        initial complaint. A consolidated, amended complaint was filed on
        February 8, 2006. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated
        complaint, and on September 15, 2006, the Court dismissed the complaint for
        lack
        of jurisdiction. In October 2006, the Plaintiffs appealed the Court’s decision
        to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. This appeal
        remains pending.

Approximately
        75 product liability class action lawsuits and more than 1,100 individual
        lawsuits are pending in various state and federal jurisdictions against Guidant
        alleging personal injuries associated with defibrillators or pacemakers involved
        in the 2005 and 2006 product communications. The majority of the cases in
        the
        United States are pending in federal court but


[Table
            of Contents]

approximately
        83 cases are currently pending in state courts. On November 7, 2005, the
        Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation established MDL-1708 (MDL) in
        the
        United States District Court for the District of Minnesota and appointed
        a
        single judge to preside over all the cases in the MDL. The MDL Court scheduled
        the first federal court trial for July 16, 2007. An additional nine lawsuits
        are
        pending in Canada. Of these nine suits in Canada, six are putative class
        actions
        and three are individual lawsuits. On June 13, 2006, the Minnesota Supreme
        Court
        appointed a single judge to preside over all Minnesota state court lawsuits
        involving cases arising from the recent product communications. The first
        state
        court trial has been scheduled in Minnesota for January 28, 2008.

In
        April
        2006, the personal injury plaintiffs and certain third-party payors served
        a
        Master Complaint in the MDL asserting claims for class action certification,
        alleging claims of strict liability, negligence, fraud, breach of warranty
        and
        other common law and/or statutory claims and seeking punitive damages. The
        majority of claimants allege no physical injury, but are suing for medical
        monitoring and anxiety. Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the
        cases
        originally scheduled to be tried in Texas state court in September 2006 are
        no
        longer set for trial.  Earlier this year, the FDA’s Office of Criminal
        Investigations has issued a subpoena to the plaintiffs’ attorneys involved in
        this trial asking plaintiffs’ counsel to turn over documents they have received
        from Guidant as part of the civil litigation discovery process. To date,
        Guidant
        has also been informed of over 4,500 claims of individuals that may or may
        not
        mature into filed suits.

Guidant
        has received requests for information in the form of Civil Investigative
        Demands
        (CID) from the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Oregon, Illinois,
        Vermont and Louisiana. These attorneys general advise that approximately
        thirty
        other states and the District of Columbia are cooperating in these CID demands.
        The CIDs pertain to whether Guidant violated any applicable state laws,
        primarily state consumer protection laws, in connection with the sale and
        promotion of certain of its implantable defibrillators. Guidant is cooperating
        with these investigations.

On
        November 2, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of New York filed a
        civil complaint against Guidant pursuant to the New York’s Consumer Protection
        Law (N.Y. Executive Law § 63(12)). In the complaint, the Attorney General
        alleges that Guidant concealed from physicians and patients a design flaw
        in its
        PRIZM 1861 defibrillator from approximately February of 2002 until May 23,
        2005. The complaint further alleges that due to Guidant’s concealment of this
        information, Guidant has engaged in repeated and persistent fraudulent conduct
        in violation of N.Y. Executive Law § 63(12). The Attorney General is seeking
        permanent injunctive relief, restitution for patients in whom a PRIZM 1861
        defibrillator manufactured before April 2002 was implanted, disgorgement
        of
        profits, and all other proper relief. This case is currently pending in the
        MDL
        in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.

Approximately
        seventy former employees have filed charges against Guidant with the U.S.
        Equal
        Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Most of the charges were filed
        in the
        Minneapolis Area Office. The charges allege that Guidant discriminated against
        the former employees on the basis of their age when Guidant terminated their
        employment in August 2004 in conjunction with Guidant’s reduction in force. In
        September 2006, the EEOC found probable cause to support the allegations
        in the
        charges pending before it. Separately, in April 2006, approximately sixty
        of
        these former employees also sued Guidant in federal district court for the
        District of Minnesota, alleging that Guidant discriminated against the former
        employees on the basis of their age when Guidant terminated their employment
        in
        August 2004 in conjunction with a reduction in force. The parties each filed
        summary judgment motions. All but one of the


[Table
            of Contents]

plaintiffs
        in the federal court action signed a full and complete release of claims
        that
        included any claim based on age discrimination, shortly after their employments
        ended in 2004. The parties conducted discovery in the fall of 2006 regarding
        the
        issue of the validity of those releases and have since filed cross motions
        for
        summary judgment on this issue. A hearing on the summary judgment motions
        was
        held on February 21, 2007, and a decision has not yet been
        rendered.

Guidant
        is a defendant in two separate complaints in which plaintiffs allege a right
        of
        recovery under the Medicare secondary payer (or MSP) private right of action,
        as
        well as related claims. Plaintiffs claim as damages double the amount paid
        by
        Medicare in connection with devices that were the subject of recent voluntary
        field actions. Both of these cases are now pending in the MDL in the United
        States District Court for the District of Minnesota. We have moved to dismiss
        one of the suits and the plaintiff filed an opposition to this motion. A
        hearing
        on the motion is expected to be scheduled early in the second quarter of
        2007.
        The Court has stayed the response time for the other action.

Guidant or
        its affiliates are defendants in four separate actions brought by private
        third-party providers of health benefits or health insurance (TPPs). In these
        cases, plaintiffs allege various theories of recovery, including derivative
        tort
        claims, subrogation, violation of consumer protection statutes and unjust
        enrichment, for the cost of healthcare benefits they allegedly paid for in
        connection with the devices that have been the subject of Guidant’s voluntary
        field actions.

Two
        of
        these actions are pending in the multi-district litigation in the federal
        district court in Minnesota (MDL) as part of a single ‘master complaint,’ filed
        on April 24, 2006, which also includes other types of claims by other
        plaintiffs. The two named TPP plaintiffs in the master complaint claim to
        represent a putative nationwide class of TPPs.  These two TPP plaintiffs
        had previously filed separate complaints against Guidant. Guidant has
        moved to dismiss the MDL TPP claims in the master complaint for failure to
        state
        a claim. A hearing on the motion is expected to be scheduled before the end
        of
        the second quarter of 2007.

The
        other
        two TPP actions are pending in state court in Minnesota, and are part of
        the coordinated state court proceeding ordered by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
        The plaintiffs in one of these cases are a number of Blue Cross & Blue
        Shield plans, while the plaintiffs in the other case are a national health
        insurer and its affiliates. The complaints in these cases were served
        on Guidant on May 18 and June 25, 2006, respectively. Guidant has moved to
        dismiss both cases. Hearings on the motions have not yet been scheduled.

In
        January 2006, Guidant was served with a civil False Claims Act qui tam
        lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
        Tennessee in September 2003 by Robert Fry, a former employee alleged to
        have worked for Guidant from 1981 to 1997. The civil lawsuit claims that
        Guidant
        violated federal law and the laws of the States of Tennessee, Florida and
        California, by allegedly concealing limited warranties related to some upgraded
        or replaced medical devices, thereby allegedly causing hospitals to allegedly
        file reimbursement claims with federal and state healthcare programs for
        amounts
        that did not reflect available warranty credits. To date, none of these
        states have formally intervened in this case. On April 25, 2006, the Court
        denied Guidant’s motion to dismiss the complaint and ordered the plaintiff to
        file a second amended complaint. On May 4, 2006, the plaintiff filed a second
        amended complaint. On May 24, 2006, Guidant moved to dismiss that complaint,
        which was denied by the Court on September 13, 2006. On October 16, 2006,
        the
        United States filed a motion to intervene in this action, which was approved
        by
        the Court on November 2, 2006.

The
        Securities and Exchange Commission has begun a formal inquiry into issues
        related to certain of Guidant’s product disclosures and trading in Guidant
        stock. Guidant is cooperating with the inquiry.

On
        November 3, 2005, a securities class action complaint was filed on behalf
        of Guidant shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
        of
        Indiana, against Guidant and several of its officers. The complaint alleges
        that
        the defendants concealed adverse information about Guidant’s defibrillators and
        pacemakers and sold stock in violation of federal securities laws. The complaint
        seeks a declaration that the lawsuit can be maintained as a class action,
        monetary damages, and injunctive relief. Several additional, related securities
        class actions were filed in November 2005 and January 2006, and were
        consolidated with the initial complaint filed on November 3, 2005. The
        Court issued an order consolidating the complaints and appointed the Iron
        Workers of Western Pennsylvania Pension Plan and David Fannon as lead
        plaintiffs. Lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. In August
        2006, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. A hearing has not yet
        been
        scheduled.

In
        October 2005, Guidant received administrative subpoenas from the U.S. Department
        of Justice U.S. Attorney’s offices in Boston and Minneapolis, issued under
        the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act of 1996. The
        subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Boston requests documents concerning
        marketing practices for pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators,
        leads and related products. The subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s office in
        Minneapolis requests documents relating to Guidant’s VENTAK PRIZM 2 and CONTAK
        RENEWAL and CONTAK RENEWAL 2 devices. Guidant is cooperating in these
        matters.

On
        May 3,
        2006, Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) filed a complaint against
        Guidant
        in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania generally
        seeking a declaration that ECRI may publish confidential pricing information
        about Guidant’s medical devices. The complaint seeks, on constitutional and
        other grounds, a declaration that confidentiality clauses contained in contracts
        between Guidant and its customers are not binding and that ECRI does not
        tortiously interfere with Guidant’s contractual relations by obtaining and
        publishing Guidant pricing information. Guidant’s motion to transfer the matter
        to Minnesota was denied and discovery is proceeding in the Eastern District
        of
        Pennsylvania. A trial is expected to be scheduled in late 2007 or early
        2008.

In
          February 2003, Boston Scientific completed its acquisition of Inflow Dynamics,
          Inc. pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 2, 2002,
          among
          Boston Scientific, Inflow Dynamics, the stockholders of Inflow Dynamics
          and
          Eckard Alt, Donald Green and Jerry Griffin, acting in each case solely
          as
          members of the Stockholder Representative Committee (the “Merger Agreement”). On
          September 21, 2006, the Stockholder Representative Committee made a demand
          for
          arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement seeking contingent
          payments with respect to the sales of our Liberte

™

stent
          system and
          TAXUS Liberte stent system. A hearing is scheduled before a panel of arbitrators
          on June 28 and 29, 2007.

On
          July
          17, 2006, Carla Woods and Jeffrey Goldberg, as Trustees of the Bionics
          Trust and
          Stockholders’ Representative, filed a lawsuit against us in the U. S. District
          Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that
          we
          breached the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Boston Scientific Corporation,
          Advanced Bionics Corporation, the Bionics Trust, Alfred E. Mann, Jeffrey
          H.
          Greiner, and David MacCallum, collectively in their capacity as Stockholders’
Representative, and others dated May 28, 2004 (“the Merger Agreement”) or,
          alternatively, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint
          seeks
          injunctive and other relief. On February 20, 2007, the Court entered a
          preliminary injunction prohibiting Boston Scientific from taking certain
          actions
          until it completes specific actions described in the Merger Agreement.
          On
          February 22, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their
          complaint to add rescission of the Merger Agreement as an additional possible
          remedy. That motion has not yet been briefed. No scheduling order has been
          entered by the court, and no trial date has been set.

On
            January 16, 2007, the French Conseil de la Concurrence (one of the bodies
            responsible for the enforcement of antitrust/competition law in France)
            issued a
            Statement of Objections alleging that Guidant had agreed with the four
            other
            main suppliers of ICDs in France to collectively refrain from responding
            to a
            2001 tender for ICDs conducted by a group of 17 University Hospital Centers
            in
            France. This alleged collusion is said to be contrary to the French Commercial
            Code and Article 81 of the European Community Treaty. We are in the process
            of
            evaluating this matter.

FDA
          Warning Letters

On
        December 23, 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing certain
        deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and
        record-keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. This
        FDA
        warning letter followed an inspection completed by the FDA on September 1,
        2005 and cited a number of observations. Guidant received a follow-up letter
        from the FDA dated January 5, 2006. As stated in this follow-up letter,
        until we have corrected the identified deficiencies, the FDA may not grant
        requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve PMA
        applications for class III devices to which the deficiencies described are
        reasonably related. The FDA conducted a further inspection of the CRM
        facility between December 15, 2005 and February 9, 2006 and made
        one additional inspectional observation. The FDA has concluded its reinspection
        of our CRM facilities.

On
        January 26, 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning
        letter from the FDA, notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three
        facilities and advising us that our corrective action plan relating to
        three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate.
        As


[Table
            of Contents]

also
        stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA may not grant our requests for
        exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve PMA applications
        for class III devices to which the quality control or current good
        manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably
        related until the deficiencies have been corrected.

Litigation-Related
        Charges

In
        2005,
        we recorded a $780 million pre-tax charge associated with the Medinol
        litigation settlement. On September 21, 2005, we reached a settlement with
        Medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation. In
        conjunction with the settlement agreement, we paid $750 million in cash and
        cancelled our equity investment in Medinol.

In
        2004,
        we recorded a $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory
        matters, which included a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice,
        which we paid in 2005.

Note K—Stockholders’
        Equity

Preferred
        Stock

We
        are
        authorized to issue 50 million shares of preferred stock in one or more
        series and to fix the powers, designations, preferences and relative
        participating, option or other rights thereof, including dividend rights,
        conversion rights, voting rights, redemption terms, liquidation preferences
        and
        the number of shares constituting any series, without any further vote or
        action
        by our stockholders. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we
        had no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

Common
        Stock

We
        are
        authorized to issue 2.0 billion shares of common stock, $.01 par value per
        share. During the first quarter of 2006, we increased our authorized common
        stock from 1.2 billion shares to 2.0 billion shares in anticipation of the
        Guidant acquisition. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per
        share.
        Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared
        by the Board of Directors, and to share ratably in our assets legally available
        for distribution to our stockholders in the event of liquidation. Holders
        of
        common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, or conversion
        rights.
        The holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. The holders
        of
        a majority of the shares of common stock can elect all of the directors and
        can
        control our management and affairs.

During
        2004, we modified certain of our stock option plans, principally for options
        granted prior to May 2001, to change the definition of retirement to
        conform to the definition generally used in our stock option plans subsequent
        to
        May 2001. As a result of these modifications, we recorded a $90 million
        charge ($60 million after-tax) in 2004. The key assumptions in estimating
        the charge were the anticipated retirement age and the expected exercise
        patterns for the individuals whose options we modified.

We
        did
        not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2006. We repurchased
        approximately 25 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of
        $734 million in 2005, and 10 million shares of our common stock at an
        aggregate cost of $360 million in 2004. Since 1992, we have repurchased
        approximately 132 million shares of our common stock and have approximately
        12 million shares of common stock held in treasury at year-end.


[Table
            of Contents]

Approximately
        37 million shares remain under previous share repurchase authorizations.
        Repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive
        plans
        and for general corporate purposes, including strategic alliances and
        acquisitions.

Note L—Stock
        Ownership Plans

Employee
        and Director Stock Incentive Plans

Our
        and 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plans (Plans) provide for the issuance of up
        to
        90 million shares of common stock. Together, the Plans cover officers,
        directors, employees and consultants and provide for the grant of various
        incentives, including qualified and nonqualified options, deferred stock
        units,
        stock grants, share appreciation rights, performance-based awards and
        market-based awards. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee
        of
        the Board of Directors, consisting of independent, non-employee directors,
        may
        authorize the issuance of common stock and authorized cash awards under the
        plans in recognition of the achievement of long-term performance objectives
        established by the Committee.

Nonqualified
        options issued to employees generally are granted with an exercise price
        equal
        to the market price of our stock on the grant date, generally vest over a
        four-year service period, and have a 10-year contractual life. In the case
        of
        qualified options, if the recipient owns more than 10 percent of the voting
        power of all classes of stock, the option granted will be at an exercise
        price
        of 110 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
        grant and will expire over a period not to exceed five years. Non-vested
        stock
        awards (awards other than options) issued to employees generally are granted
        with an exercise price of zero and t

ypically
        vest in four to five equal annual installments beginning with the second
        anniversary of the date of grant. These awards represent our commitment to
        issue
        shares to recipients after a vesting period. The slightly longer vesting
        period
        for non-vested stock awards reflects the fact that they have immediate value
        compared to options, which only have value if our stock price increases.
        Upon
        each vesting date, such awards are no longer subject to risk of forfeiture
        and
        we issue shares of our common stock to the recipient.

We
        generally issue shares for option exercises and non-vested stock from our
        treasury, if available.

During
        2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

,
        which
        is a revision of Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
        Compensation

. Statement No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion
        No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and
        amends Statement No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

.
        In
        general, Statement No. 123(R) contains similar accounting concepts as those
        described in Statement No. 123. However, Statement No. 123(R) requires
        that we recognize all share-based payments to employees, including grants
        of
        employee stock options, in our consolidated statements of operations based
        on
        their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an
        alternative.

We
        adopted Statement No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the “modified-prospective
        method,” which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning
        with the effective date (i) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123(R)
        for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (ii) based
        on
        the requirements of Statement No. 123 for all awards granted to employees
        prior
        to the effective date of Statement No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the
        effective date. In accordance with this method of adoption, we have not restated
        prior period results of operations and financial position to reflect the
        impact
        of stock-based compensation expense. Prior to the adoption of Statement
        No. 123(R), we accounted for options using the intrinsic value method under
        the guidance of APB Opinion No. 25, and provided pro forma disclosure as
        allowed
        by Statement No. 123.


[Table
            of Contents]

The
        following presents the impact on our consolidated statement of operations
        of
        stock-based compensation expense recognized for the year ended December 31,
        for options and restricted stock awards:

For
        the
        year ended December 31, 2006, as a result of adopting Statement No. 123(R),
        our
        loss before income taxes was $68 million lower and our net loss was $48 million
        lower than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under
        APB
        Opinion No. 25. Basic and diluted loss per share was $0.04 lower than if
        we had
        continued to account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion No.
        25.

If
        we had
        elected to recognize compensation expense for the granting of options under
        stock option plans based on the fair values at the grant date consistent
        with
        the methodology prescribed by Statement No. 123, we would have reported net
        income and net income per share as the following pro forma amounts:

Option
        Valuation

We
        use
        the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value
        of
        our stock options. In conjunction with the Guidant acquisition, we converted
        certain outstanding Guidant options into approximately 40 million fully vested
        Boston Scientific options. See

Note
        D - Business Combinations

for
        further details regarding the fair value and valuation assumptions related
        to
        those awards. The fair value for all other options granted during 2006, 2005
        and
        2004 was calculated using the following estimated weighted average
        assumptions:

Expected
        Volatility

We
        have
        considered a number of factors in estimating volatility. For options granted
        prior to 2006, we used our historical volatility as a basis to estimate expected
        volatility in our valuation of


[Table
            of Contents]

stock
        options. We changed our method of estimating volatility upon the adoption
        of
        Statement No. 123(R). We now consider historical volatility, trends in
        volatility within our industry/peer group, and implied volatility.

Expected
        Term

We
        estimate the expected term of our options using historical exercise and
        forfeiture data. We believe that this historical data is currently the best
        estimate of the expected term of our new option grants.

Risk-Free
        Interest Rate

We
        use
        yield rates on U.S. Treasury securities for a period approximating the expected
        term of the award to estimate the risk-free interest rate in our grant-date
        fair
        value assessment.

Expected
        Dividend Yield

We
        have
        not historically paid cash dividends to our shareholders. We currently do
        not
        intend to pay dividends, and intend to retain all of our earnings to repay
        indebtedness and invest in the continued growth of our business. Therefore,
        we
        have assumed an expected dividend yield of zero in our grant-date fair value
        assessment.

Information
        related to non-vested stock awards during 2006 is as follows:

CEO
        Award

During
        the first quarter of 2006, we granted a special market-based award of 2 million
        deferred stock units to our chief executive officer. The attainment of this
        award is based on the individual’s continued employment and our stock reaching
        certain specified prices as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. We
        determined the fair value of the award to be approximately $15 million based
        on
        a Monte Carlo simulation, using the following assumptions:

We
        will
        recognize the expense in our consolidated statement of operations using an
        accelerated attribution method through 2009.

Expense
        Attribution

We
        generally recognize compensation expense for our stock awards issued subsequent
        to the adoption of Statement No. 123(R) using a straight-line method over
        the
        substantive vesting period. Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 123(R),
        we
        allocated the pro forma compensation expense for stock option awards over
        the
        vesting period using an accelerated attribution method. We will continue
        to
        amortize compensation expense related to stock option awards granted prior
        to
        the adoption of Statement No. 123(R) using an accelerated attribution method.
        Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 123(R), we recognized compensation
        expense for non-vested stock awards over the vesting period using a
        straight-line method. We will continue to amortize


[Table
            of Contents]

compensation
        expense related to non-vested stock awards granted prior to the adoption
        of
        Statement No. 123(R) using a straight-line method.

We
        recognize stock-based compensation for the value of the portion of awards
        that
        are ultimately expected to vest. Statement No. 123(R) requires forfeitures
        to be
        estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
        if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is
        distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested
        portion of the surrendered option. We have applied, based on an analysis
        of our
        historical forfeitures, an annual forfeiture rate of eight percent to all
        unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2006, which represents the portion
        that
        we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period. We will
        re-evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as
        necessary. Ultimately, we will only recognize expense for those shares
        that vest.

Most
        of
        our stock awards provide for immediate vesting upon retirement, death or
        disability of the participant. We have traditionally accounted for the pro
        forma
        compensation expense related to stock-based awards made to retirement eligible
        individuals using the stated vesting period of the award. This approach results
        in the recognition of compensation expense over the vesting period except
        in the
        instance of the participant’s actual retirement. Statement No. 123(R)
        clarified the accounting for stock-based awards made to retirement eligible
        individuals, which explicitly provides that the vesting period for a grant
        made
        to a retirement eligible employee is considered non-substantive and should
        be
        ignored when determining the period over which the award should be expensed.
        Upon adoption of Statement No. 123(R), we are required to expense
        stock-based awards over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility
        or immediately if the employee is retirement eligible at the date of grant.
        If
        we had historically accounted for stock-based awards made to retirement eligible
        individuals under these requirements, the pro forma expense disclosed in
        the
        table above for 2005 and 2004 would not have been materially
        impacted.

Unrecognized
        Compensation Cost

Under
        the
        provisions of Statement No. 123(R), we expect to recognize the following
        future expense for awards granted as of December 31, 2006:

*Amounts
        presented represent compensation cost, net of estimated
        forfeitures.

Tax
        Impact of Stock-Based Compensation

Prior
        to
        the adoption of Statement No. 123(R), we reported the benefit of tax
        deductions in excess of recognized share-based compensation expense on our
        consolidated statement of cash flows as


[Table
            of Contents]

operating
        cash flows. Under Statement No. 123(R), such excess tax benefits must be
        reported as financing cash flows. Although total cash flows under Statement
        No. 123(R) remain unchanged from what we would have reported under prior
        accounting standards, our net operating cash flows are reduced and our net
        financing cash flows are increased due to the adoption of Statement No.
        123(R). There were excess tax benefits of $7 million for 2006, which we
        have classified as financing cash flows. There were excess tax benefits of
        $28
        million for 2005 and $185 million for 2004, which we have classified as
        operating cash flows.

Shares
        reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans totaled
        approximately 88 million at December 31, 2006.

Employee
        Stock Purchase Plans

In
        2006,
        our stockholders approved and adopted a new global employee stock purchase
        plan
        that provides for the granting of options to purchase up to 20 million
        shares of our common stock to all eligible employees. The terms and conditions
        of the 2006 employee stock purchase plan are substantially similar to the
        previous employee stock purchase plan, which expires by its terms in 2007.
        Under
        the employee stock purchase plan, we grant each eligible employee, at the
        beginning of each six-month offering period, an option to purchase shares
        of our common stock equal to not more than 10 percent of the employee’s
        eligible compensation or the statutory limit under the U.S. Internal Revenue
        Code. Such options may be exercised generally only to the extent of accumulated
        payroll deductions at the end of the offering period, at a purchase price
        equal
        to 85 percent of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning
        or end of each offering period, whichever is less. For the offering period
        beginning July 1, 2007, the employee stock purchase plan was amended to reduce
        the employee discount for purchasing stock through the program from 15 percent
        to 10 percent. At December 31, 2006, there were approximately 21 million
        shares available for future issuance under the employee stock purchase
        plan.

Information
        related to the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan and the
        range of purchase prices is as follows:

                    issued

                    - $22.95

$30.22
                    - $30.81

We
        use
        the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value
        of
        shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan. We recognize expense
        related to shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan ratably
        over the offering period. During 2006, we recognized $12 million in expense
        associated with our employee stock purchase plan.

In
        connection with our acquisition of Guidant, we assumed Guidant’s employee stock
        ownership plan (ESOP) which matches employee 401(k) contributions in the
        form of
        stock. Common shares held by the ESOP are allocated among participants’ accounts
        on a periodic basis until these shares are exhausted. At December 31, 2006,
        the ESOP held approximately 6.4 million shares allocated to employee
        accounts and approximately 2.6 million unallocated shares. We report the
        cost of shares held by the ESOP and not yet allocated to employees as a
        reduction of stockholders’ equity. Allocated shares of the ESOP are charged to
        expense based on the fair value of the shares transferred and are treated
        as
        outstanding in the computation of earnings per share. As part of the Guidant
        purchase accounting, we recognized deferred costs of $86 million for the
        fair
        value of the shares that were unallocated on the date of acquisition. Since
        the
        acquisition date,


[Table
            of Contents]

we
        have
        recognized compensation expense of $19 million related to the plan. The fair
        value of the unallocated shares at December 31, 2006 was $44
        million.

Note M—Earnings
        per Share

The
        computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows:

The
        calculation of net (loss) income per common share, assuming dilution, above
        excludes the net effect of common stock equivalents of 15.6 million for
        2006 due to our net loss position for the year ended December 31,
        2006.

The
        net
        effect of common stock equivalents excludes the impact of 30 million stock
        options for 2006, 12 million for 2005, and 1 million for 2004 due to the
        exercise prices of these stock options being greater than the average fair
        market value of our common stock during the year.

Note N—Segment
        Reporting

We
        have
        four reportable operating segments based on geographic regions: the United
        States, Europe, Japan and Inter-Continental. Each of our reportable segments
        generates revenues from the sale of less-invasive medical devices. The
        reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within
        each segment. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment
        income. This segment income excludes certain corporate and manufacturing
        expenses associated with divisions that do not meet the definition of a segment,
        as defined by FASB Statement No. 131,

Disclosures
        about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.

In
        addition, certain transactions or adjustments that our chief operating decision
        maker considers to be non-recurring and/or non-operational, as well as
        stock-based compensation and amortization expense are excluded from segment
        income. Although we exclude these amounts from segment income, they are included
        in reported consolidated net (loss) income and are included in the
        reconciliation below.

Sales
        and
        operating results of reportable segments are based on internally derived
        standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year and do
        not
        include intersegment profits. We have restated the segment information for
        and 2004 net sales and operating results based on our standard foreign exchange
        rates used for 2006. Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments,
        the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the
        geographic

distribution that would occur if the segments were not


[Table
            of Contents]

interdependent.
        We base enterprise-wide information on actual foreign exchange rates used
        in our
        consolidated financial statements.

A
        reconciliation of the totals reported for the reportable segments to the
        applicable line items in our consolidated financial statements is as follows:

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial
        Statements

The
        Board
        of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation

We
        have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific
        Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the
        related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
        flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006.
        Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index
        at
        Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
        of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
        these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
        all
        material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific
        Corporation at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the
        consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
        three
        years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
        generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
        financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
        statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
        information set forth therein.

As
        discussed in Notes A and L to the consolidated financial statements, on
        January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
        Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

We
        also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Boston
        Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
        December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
        Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
        of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2007,
        expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

QUARTERLY
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(in
        millions, except per share data)

(unaudited)

During
        2006, we recorded net after-tax charges of $29 million in the first quarter,
        $4.541 billion in the second quarter, $77 million in the third quarter
        and net credits of $127 million in the fourth quarter. The net charges for
        the year consisted of: a non-cash charge for purchased in-process research
        and
        development costs related to the Guidant acquisition; a charge resulting
        from a
        purchase accounting associated with the step-up value of acquired Guidant
        inventory sold; other charges related primarily to the Guidant acquisition,
        including the fair value adjustment related to the sharing of proceeds feature
        of the Abbott stock purchase; and a credit associated with the reversal of
        tax
        accruals previously established for offshore unremitted earnings. In 2006,
        amortization expense, net of tax, was $398 million and stock-based compensation
        expense, net of tax, was $89 million.

During
        2005, we recorded after-tax charges of $73 million in the first quarter,
        $199 million in the second quarter, $616 million in the third quarter
        and $6 million in the fourth quarter. The net charges for the year
        consisted of: a litigation settlement with Medinol, Ltd.; purchased research
        and
        development; expenses related to certain retirement benefits; asset write-downs
        and employee-related costs that resulted from certain business optimization
        initiatives; and a benefit for a tax adjustment associated with a technical
        correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. In 2005, amortization
        expense, net of tax, was $108 million and stock-based compensation expense,
        net
        of tax, was $14 million.
