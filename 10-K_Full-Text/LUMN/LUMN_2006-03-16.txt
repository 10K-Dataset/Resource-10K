PART
      I

Item
                1.

Business

General

.
      CenturyTel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated
      communications company engaged primarily in providing local exchange, long
      distance, Internet access and broadband services. We strive to maintain our
      customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings
      to
      provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications
      services. We conduct all of our operations in 26 states located within the
      continental United States.

At
      December 31, 2005, our local exchange telephone subsidiaries operated
      approximately 2.2 million telephone access lines, primarily in rural areas
      and
      small to mid-size cities in 22 states, with over 70% of these lines located
      in
      Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas and Washington. According to published
      sources, we are the eighth largest local exchange telephone company in the
      United States based on the number of access lines served.

We
      also
      provide fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier, security
      monitoring, and other communications and business information services in
      certain local and regional markets.

We
      have
      entered into agreements to provide co-branded satellite television service
      and
      to resell wireless service as part of our bundled product and service offerings,
      but these arrangements are not expected to contribute material revenues in
      the
      near term. In addition, we recently began offering our facilities-based digital
      video service to certain areas of a limited number of markets in Wisconsin.
      We
      anticipate such offerings will dilute our earnings for 2006 by approximately
      $.06 to $.08 per share.

For
      information on the amount of revenue derived by our various lines of services,
      see “Operations-Services” below and Item 7 of this annual report.

Recent
      acquisitions

.
      In June
      2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom
      Holdings, Inc. (“KMC”) for approximately $75.5 million, which allows us to offer
      broadband and competitive local exchange services to customers in these markets.

In
      June
      2003, we purchased for $39.4 million the assets of Digital Teleport, Inc.,
      a
      regional communications company providing wholesale data transport services
      to
      other communications carriers over its fiber optic network located in Missouri,
      Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas. In addition, in December 2003, we acquired
      additional fiber transport assets in Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois from Level
      3 Communications, Inc. for approximately $15.8 million cash. For additional
      information, see “Operations - Services - Fiber Transport and CLEC.”

On
      August
      31, 2002, we purchased assets utilized in serving approximately 350,000
      telephone access lines in the state of Missouri from Verizon Communications,
      Inc. (“Verizon”) for approximately $1.179 billion cash. On July 1, 2002, we
      purchased assets utilized in serving approximately 300,000 telephone access
      lines in the state of Alabama from Verizon for approximately $1.022 billion
      cash.

The
      assets purchased in these transactions included (i) the franchises and equipment
      necessary to conduct local exchange operations in predominantly rural markets
      throughout Alabama and Missouri and (ii) Verizon's assets used to provide
      digital subscriber line ("DSL") and other high speed data services within the
      purchased exchanges. The acquired assets did not include Verizon's cellular,
      personal communications services (“PCS”), long distance, dial-up Internet, or
      directory publishing operations in these areas.

On
      February 28, 2002, we purchased from KMC its fiber network and customer base
      operations in Monroe and Shreveport, Louisiana, which allowed us to offer
      broadband and competitive local exchange services to customers in these markets.

On
      July
      31, 2000 and September 29, 2000, we acquired assets utilized to provide local
      exchange telephone service to over 490,000 telephone access lines from Verizon
      in four separate transactions for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. Under
      these transactions:

·

On
                July 31, 2000, we purchased approximately 231,000 telephone access
                lines
                and related assets in Arkansas for approximately $842 million in
                cash.

·

On
                July 31, 2000, Spectra Communications Group, LLC ("Spectra") purchased
                approximately 127,000 telephone access lines and related assets in
                Missouri for approximately $297 million cash. At closing, we made
                a
                preferred equity investment in Spectra of approximately $55 million
                (which
                represented a 57.1% interest) and financed substantially all of the
                remainder of the purchase price. In the first quarter of 2001, we
                purchased an additional 18.6% interest in Spectra for $47.1 million.
                In
                the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, we purchased
                the
                remaining 24.3% interest in Spectra for an aggregate of $34.0 million
                in
                cash.

·

On
                September 29, 2000, we purchased approximately 70,500 telephone access
                lines and related assets in Wisconsin for approximately $197 million
                in
                cash.

·

On
                September 29, 2000, Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC ("TelUSA") purchased
                approximately 62,900 telephone access lines and related assets in
                Wisconsin for approximately $172 million in cash. We own 89% of TelUSA,
                which was organized to acquire and operate these Wisconsin properties.
                At
                closing, we made an equity investment in TelUSA of approximately
                $37.8
                million and financed substantially all of the remainder of the purchase
                price.

In
      August
      2000, we acquired the assets of CSW Net, Inc., a regional Internet service
      provider that offers dial-up and dedicated Internet access, and web site and
      domain hosting to more than 18,000 customers in 28 communities in
      Arkansas.

We
      continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications
      assets in exchange for cash, securities or both, and at any given time may
      be
      engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We
      generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered
      into a preliminary or definitive agreement. Although our primary focus will
      continue to be on acquiring interests that are proximate to our properties
      or
      that serve a customer base large enough for us to operate efficiently, other
      communications interests may also be acquired and these acquisitions could
      have
      a material impact upon us.

Recent
      Dispositions

.
      On
      August 1, 2002, we sold substantially all of our wireless operations principally
      to an affiliate of ALLTEL Corporation (“Alltel”) for an aggregate of
      approximately $1.59 billion in cash. In connection with this transaction, we
      divested our (i) interest in our majority-owned and operated cellular systems,
      which at June 30, 2002 served approximately 783,000 customers and had access
      to
      approximately 7.8 million pops (the estimated population of licensed cellular
      telephone markets multiplied by our proportionate equity interest in the
      licensed operators thereof), (ii) minority cellular equity interests
      representing approximately 1.8 million pops at June 30, 2002, and (iii) licenses
      to provide PCS covering 1.3 million pops in Wisconsin and Iowa.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2001, we sold to Leap Wireless International, Inc. 30 PCS
      operating licenses for an aggregate of $205 million.

Where
      to find additional information.

We
      make
      available our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on
      Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K on our website (

www.centurytel.com

)
      as soon
      as reasonably practicable after we complete such filings with the
      SEC.

We
      also
      make available on our website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Corporate
      Compliance Program and the charters of our audit, compensation, risk evaluation,
      and nominating and corporate governance committees. We will furnish printed
      copies of these materials free of charge upon the request of any
      shareholder.

In
      connection with filing this annual report, our chief executive officer and
      chief
      financial officer made the certifications regarding our financial disclosures
      required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Act’s related
      regulations. In addition, during 2005 our chief executive officer certified
      to
      the New York Stock Exchange that he was unaware of any violation by us of the
      New York Stock Exchange’s corporate governance listing standards.

Industry
      information

.
      Unless
      otherwise indicated, information contained in this annual report and other
      documents filed by us under the federal securities laws concerning our views
      and
      expectations regarding the telecommunications industry are based on assumptions
      and estimates prepared by us using data from industry sources, and on
      assumptions made by us based on our management’s knowledge and experience in the
      markets in which we operate and the telecommunications industry generally.
      We
      believe these estimates and assumptions are accurate as of the date made.
      However, this information may prove to be inaccurate because it cannot always
      be
      verified with certainty. You should be aware that we have not independently
      verified data from industry or other third-party sources and cannot guarantee
      its accuracy or completeness. Our estimates and assumptions involve risks and
      uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including
      those discussed in Item 1A of this annual report.

Other

.
      As of
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately 6,900 employees, of which approximately
      1,800 were members of 12 different bargaining units represented by the
      International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Communications Workers
      of America. We believe that relations with our employees continue to be
      generally good. On March 1, 2006, we reduced our workforce by approximately
      jobs, or 4% of our workforce, due to increased competitive pressures and the
      loss of access lines over the last several years.

We
      were
      incorporated under Louisiana law in 1968 to serve as a holding company for
      several telephone companies acquired over the previous 15 to 20 years. Our
      principal executive offices are located at 100 CenturyTel Drive, Monroe,
      Louisiana 71203 and our telephone number is (318) 388-9000.

OPERATIONS

According
      to published sources, we are the eighth largest local exchange telephone company
      in the United States, based on the approximately 2.2 million access lines we
      served at December 31, 2005. An “access line” is a telephone line that connects
      a home or business to the public switched telephone network. All of our access
      lines are digitally switched. Through our operating telephone subsidiaries,
      we
      provide local exchange services to predominantly rural areas and small to
      mid-sized cities in 22 states. Our local exchange companies serve an average
      of
      approximately 13 access lines per square mile versus a nationwide average of
      approximately 51 access lines per square mile.

The
      following table lists additional information regarding our access lines as
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004.

*

Represents
      less than 1%.

(1)

As
                of December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 55,600 and 57,700,
                respectively, of these lines were owned and operated by our 89%-owned
                affiliate.

As
      indicated in the following table, we have experienced growth in our operating
      revenues over the past five years, a substantial portion of which was
      attributable to

the
      third
      quarter 2002 acquisition of telephone properties from Verizon and the internal
      growth of our long distance and Internet access businesses.

As
      discussed further below, our access lines (exclusive of acquisitions) have
      declined in recent years, and are expected to continue to decline. To mitigate
      these declines, we hope to, among other things, (i) promote long-term
      relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services, (ii)
      provide new services, such as video and wireless, and other additional services
      that may be made possible by advances in technology, spectrum sales or
      improvements in our infrastructure, (iii) provide our premium services to a
      higher percentage of our customers, (iv) pursue acquisitions of additional
      communications properties if available at attractive prices, (v) increase usage
      of our networks, and (vi) market our products to new customers. See “Services”
and “Regulation and Competition.”

S

ervices

We
      derive
      revenue from providing (i) local exchange telephone services, (ii) network
      access services, (iii) long distance services, (iv) data services, which
      includes both DSL and dial-up Internet services, as well as special access
      and
      private line services, (v) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and
      security monitoring services and (vi) other related services. The following
      table reflects the percentage of operating revenues derived from these
      respective services:

Local
      service.

We
      derive our local service revenues by providing local exchange telephone services
      in our service areas, including basic dial-tone service through our regular
      switched network, generally for a fixed monthly charge. Access lines declined
      4.3% in 2005, 2.6% in 2004 and 1.6% in 2003. We believe these declines in the
      number of access lines were primarily due to the displacement of traditional
      wireline telephone services by other competitive services. Based on current
      conditions, we expect access lines to decline between 4.5% and 5.5% for
      2006.

In
      exchange for additional charges, we offer enhanced voice services (such as
      call
      forwarding, conference calling, caller identification, selective call ringing
      and call waiting) and data services (such as data private line, digital
      subscriber line, frame relay and local area/wide area networks). In 2005, we
      continued to expand the availability of enhanced services offered in certain
      service areas.

Network
      access.

We
      derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to
      various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities
      to
      originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions
      and
      (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion
      of
      our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms (see - “Regulation
      and Competition Relating to Incumbent Local Exchange Operations” below). Our
      revenues for switched access services depend on the level of call
      volume.

Certain
      of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges
      prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”); the remainder of
      such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local
      exchange carriers (“LECs”) administered by the National Exchange Carrier
      Association (“NECA”), a quasi-governmental non-profit organization formed by the
      FCC in 1983 for such purposes.

Certain
      of our intrastate network access revenues are derived through access charges
      that we bill to intrastate long distance carriers and other LEC customers.
      Such
      intrastate network access charges are based on tariffed access charges, which
      are subject to state regulatory commission approval. Additionally, certain
      of
      our intrastate network access revenues, along with intrastate and intra-LATA
      (Local Access and Transport Areas) long distance revenues, are derived through
      revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs.

The
      Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access
      tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those
      tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been “deemed lawful” in effect nullify an
      interexchange carrier’s ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the
      tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return
      prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate
      tariffs directly with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. For those
      tariffs that have not yet been “deemed lawful”, we initially record as a
      liability our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return, and may
      thereafter recognize as revenues some or all of these amounts at the end of
      the
      settlement period or as our legal entitlement thereto becomes more certain.
      We
      recorded approximately $35.9 million as revenue in the third quarter of 2005
      as
      the settlement period related to the 2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on
      September 30, 2005. We do not expect to have this level of revenue settlements
      occur in 2006. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of our earnings in excess
      of
      the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability on the balance sheet
      for
      the 2003/2004 monitoring period aggregated approximately $31.5 million. The
      settlement period related to the 2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on September
      30, 2007. We will continue to monitor the legal status of any proceedings that
      could impact our entitlement to these funds.

Long
      distance

.
      We
      derive our long distance revenues by providing retail long distance services
      based on either usage or pursuant to flat-rate calling plans. At December 31,
      2005, we provided long distance services to nearly 1.2 million lines. We
      continue to add new customers, although the rate of our customer growth has
      slowed in recent periods. We anticipate that most of our long distance service
      revenues will be provided as part of an integrated bundle with our other service
      offerings, including our local exchange telephone service offering.

Data.

We
      derive

our
      data
      revenues primarily from monthly recurring charges for providing Internet access
      services (both DSL and dial-up services) and data transmission services over
      special circuits and private lines. We began offering traditional dial-up
      Internet access services to our telephone customers in 1995. In late 1999,
      we
      began offering DSL Internet access services, a high-speed premium-priced data
      service. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 75% of our access lines were
      DSL-enabled. At December 31, 2005, we provided DSL access services to over
      248,700 customers and dial-up services to over 108,000 customers. During 2005,
      we added over 106,000 DSL connections.

Fiber
      transport and CLEC

.
      Our
      fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport,
      competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) and security monitoring
      businesses.

In
      late
      2000, we began offering competitive local exchange telephone services as part
      of
      a bundled service offering to small to medium-sized businesses in Monroe and
      Shreveport, Louisiana. On February 28, 2002, we purchased the fiber network
      and
      customer base of KMC’s operations in Monroe and Shreveport, Louisiana and in
      June 2005, we purchased the fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC
      which allowed us to offer broadband and competitive local exchange services
      to
      customers in these markets. As of December 31, 2005, our competitive local
      exchange markets provided service over 1,200 miles of lit fiber.

Under
      the
      name “LightCore”, we sell fiber capacity to other carriers and businesses over a
      network that encompassed, at December 31, 2005, over 9,200 miles of lit fiber
      in
      the central United States. We began our fiber transport business during the
      second quarter of 2001, when we began selling capacity over a 700-mile fiber
      optic ring that we constructed in southern and central Michigan. In June 2003,
      we acquired the assets of Digital Teleport, Inc., a regional communications
      company providing wholesale data transport services to other communications
      carriers over its fiber optic network located in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma
      and Kansas. We have used the network to sell services to new and existing
      customers and to reduce our reliance on third party transport providers. In
      addition, in December 2003, we acquired additional fiber transport assets in
      Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois from Level 3 Communications, Inc. to provide
      services similar to those described above.

We
      offer
      24-hour burglary and fire monitoring services to over 9,000 customers in select
      markets in Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Ohio.

Other.

We
      derive our other revenues principally by (i) leasing, selling, installing and
      maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii)
      providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating
      in the publication of local telephone directories and (iv) offering our new
      video and wireless services. We also provide printing, database management
      and
      direct mail services and cable television services.

During
      2005, we began offering co-branded satellite television service to virtually
      all
      households in our service areas, except for the LaCrosse, Wisconsin market,
      where we initiated our switched digital television service. We continue to
      monitor the results from this initial launch of switched digital television
      service and currently plan to initiate a second switched digital video trial
      during 2006. In mid-2005, we completed an agreement with one wireless carrier
      to
      resell wireless services and, by the end of 2005, we offered wireless service
      through this agreement to markets serving approximately 17% of our residential
      access lines.

From
      time
      to time, we also make investments in other domestic or foreign communications
      companies.

For
      further information on regulatory, technological and competitive changes that
      could impact our revenues, see “-Regulation and Competition” under this Item 1
      below and “Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements” under Item 1A below. For more
      information on the financial contributions of our various services, see Item
      of this annual report.

Federal
      Financing Programs

Certain
      of our telephone subsidiaries receive long-term financing from the Rural
      Utilities Service (“RUS”), a federal agency that has historically provided
      long-term financing to telephone companies at relatively attractive interest
      rates. Approximately 19% of our telephone plant is pledged to secure obligations
      of our telephone subsidiaries to the RUS. For additional information regarding
      our financing, see our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8
      herein.

Sales
      and Marketing

We
      maintain local offices in most of the population centers within our service
      territories. These offices are typically staffed by local residents and provide
      sales and customer support services in the community. In addition, our strategy
      is to enhance our communications services by offering comprehensive bundling
      of
      services and deploying new technologies to build upon the strong reputation
      we
      enjoy in our markets and to further promote customer loyalty.

Network
      Architecture

Our
      local
      exchange carrier networks consist of central office hosts and remote sites,
      all
      with advanced digital switches (primarily manufactured by Nortel and Siemens)
      and operating with licensed software. Our outside plant consists of transport
      and distribution delivery networks connecting each of our host central offices
      to our remote central offices, and ultimately to our customers. As of December
      31, 2005, we maintained over 242,000 miles of copper plant and approximately
      17,800 miles of fiber optic plant in our local exchange networks. Our fiber
      optic cable is the primary transport technology between our host and remote
      central offices and interconnection points with other incumbent carriers. For
      additional related information, see “- Services - Fiber Transport and
      CLEC.”

Regulation
      and Competition Relating to Incumbent Local Exchange
      Operations

Traditionally,
      LECs operated as regulated monopolies having the exclusive right and
      responsibility to provide local telephone services. (These LECs are sometimes
      referred to below as “incumbent LECs” or “ILECs”). Consequently, most of our
      intrastate telephone operations have traditionally been regulated extensively
      by
      various state regulatory agencies (generally called public service commissions
      or public utility commissions) and our interstate operations have been regulated
      by the FCC. As we discuss in greater detail below, passage of the
      Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), coupled with state legislative
      and regulatory initiatives and technological changes, fundamentally altered
      the
      telephone industry by reducing the regulation of LECs and attracting a
      substantial increase in the number of competitors and capital invested in
      existing and new services. We anticipate that these trends toward reduced
      regulation and increased competition will continue.

The
      following description discusses some of the major industry regulations that
      affect us, but numerous other regulations not discussed below could also impact
      us. Some legislation and regulations are currently the subject of judicial
      proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals which could
      change the manner in which the communications industry operates. Neither the
      outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us, can
      be
      predicted at this time. Regulation can change rapidly in the communications
      industry, and such changes may have an adverse effect on us in the future.
      See
      Item 1A of this annual report below.

State
      regulation

.
      The
      local service rates and intrastate access charges of substantially all of our
      telephone subsidiaries are regulated by state regulatory commissions which
      typically have the power to grant and revoke franchises authorizing companies
      to
      provide communications services. Most commissions have traditionally regulated
      pricing through “rate of return” regulation that focuses on authorized levels of
      earnings by LECs. Historically, most of these commissions also (i) regulated
      the
      purchase and sale of LECs, (ii) prescribed depreciation rates and certain
      accounting procedures, (iii) enforced laws requiring LECs to provide universal
      service under publicly filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and
      prices of their LEC services, (iv) oversaw implementation of several federal
      telecommunications laws and (v) regulated various other matters, including
      certain service standards and operating procedures.

In
      recent
      years, state legislatures and regulatory commissions in several of the 22 states
      in which our telephone subsidiaries operate have either reduced the regulation
      of LECs or have announced their intention to do so, and we expect this trend
      will continue. Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas and several other states
      have implemented laws or rulings which require or permit LECs to opt out of
      “rate of return” regulation in exchange for agreeing to alternative forms of
      regulation which typically permit the LEC greater freedom to establish local
      service rates in exchange for agreeing not to charge rates in excess of
      specified caps. As discussed further below, subsidiaries operating over 60%
      of
      our access lines in various states have agreed to be governed by alternative
      regulation plans, and we continue to explore our options for similar treatment
      in other states. We believe that reduced regulatory oversight of certain of
      our
      telephone operations may allow us to offer new and competitive services faster
      than under the traditional regulatory process. For a discussion of legislative,
      regulatory and technological changes that have introduced competition into
      the
      local exchange industry, see “-Developments Affecting Competition.”

Alternative
      regulation plans govern some or all of the access lines operated by us in
      Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama and Arkansas, which are our four largest markets.
      The following summary describes the alternative regulation plans applicable
      to
      us in these states.

·

Our
      Wisconsin access
      lines, except for those acquired from Verizon in 2000 (which continue to be
      regulated under “rate of return” regulation), are regulated under various
      alternative regulation plans. Each of these alternative regulation plans has
      a
      five-year term and permits us to adjust local rates within specified parameters
      if we meet certain quality-of-service and infrastructure-development
      commitments. These plans also include initiatives designed to promote
      competition.

·

All
      of
      our Missouri LECs are regulated under a price-cap regulation plan whereby basic
      service rates are adjusted annually based on an inflation-based factor;
      non-basic services may be increased without restriction up to 5% annually.
      Based
      on our annual filing with the Missouri Commission effective September 2005,
      we
      estimate a $3.6 million annual reduction in revenues as a result of recent
      declines in the inflation-based factor. If the inflation-based factor continues
      to decline, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted.

·

Beginning
      in 2005, our Alabama telephone properties have been subject to an alternative
      regulation plan. Under this plan, residential and business basic local service
      rates will remain at existing levels for two years, after which rates can be
      increased up to five percent per year up to a maximum capped level. Rates for
      all other retail services may be adjusted depending on the tier designation
      established under the plan.

·

Our
      Arkansas LECs, excluding the properties acquired from Verizon in 2000, are
      regulated under an alternative regulation plan adopted in 1997, which initially
      froze basic local and access rates for three years, after which time such rates
      can be adjusted based on an inflation-based factor. Other local rates can be
      adjusted without commission approval; however, such rates are subject to
      commission review under certain conditions.

Notwithstanding
      the movement toward alternative regulation, LECs operating approximately 38%
      of
      our total access lines continue to be subject to “rate of return” regulation for
      intrastate purposes. These LECs remain subject to the powers of state regulatory
      commissions to conduct earnings reviews and adjust service rates, either of
      which could lead to revenue reductions.

FCC
      regulation

.
      The FCC
      regulates interstate services provided by our telephone subsidiaries primarily
      by regulating the interstate access charges that we bill to long distance
      companies and other communications companies for use of our network in
      connection with the origination and termination of interstate voice and data
      transmissions. Additionally, the FCC has prescribed certain rules and
      regulations for telephone companies, including a uniform system of accounts
      and
      rules regarding the separation of costs between jurisdictions and, ultimately,
      between interstate services. LECs must obtain FCC approval to use certain radio
      frequencies, or to transfer control of any such licenses. The FCC retains the
      right to revoke these licenses if a carrier materially violates relevant legal
      requirements.

The
      FCC
      requires price-cap regulation of interstate access rates for the Regional Bell
      Operating Companies, and permits it for all other LECs. Under price-cap
      regulation, limits imposed on a company’s interstate rates are adjusted
      periodically to reflect inflation, productivity improvement and changes in
      certain non-controllable costs. We have not elected price-cap regulation for
      our
      incumbent operations. However, the properties we acquired from Verizon in 2002
      have continued to operate under price-cap regulation, as permitted under FCC
      rules for acquired properties.

In
      2003,
      the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate
      goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications
      industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying or
      delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier
      compensation proposals from several industry groups, and in early 2005 solicited
      comments on all proposals previously submitted to it. Industry negotiations
      are
      continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses the
      concerns of carriers from all industry segments. Various concepts are under
      consideration that would attempt to unify all intercarrier rates for all types
      of traffic to the greatest extent possible. We are involved in this proceeding
      and will continue to monitor the implications of these plans to our operations.
      There is a chance that some type of consensus plan will be filed at the FCC
      in
      2006. Until this proceeding concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing
      rules are established, we cannot estimate the impact this proceeding will have
      on our results of operations.

As
      discussed further below, certain providers of competitive communications
      services are currently not required to compensate ILECs for the use of their
      networks.

All
      forms
      of federal support available to ILECs are currently available to any local
      competitor that qualifies as an “eligible telecommunications carrier.” This
      support could encourage additional competitors to enter our high-cost service
      areas, and, as discussed further below, place financial pressure on the FCC’s
      support programs.

Our
      operations and those of all communications carriers also may be impacted by
      legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to
      assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland security, minimizing
      environmental impacts, or addressing other issues that impact our business.
      For
      example, existing provisions of the Communications Assistance for Law
      Enforcement Act and FCC regulations implementing this Act require communications
      carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities, and services are able
      to
      facilitate authorized electronic surveillance. These laws and regulations may
      cause us to incur additional costs.

Universal
      service support funds, revenue sharing arrangements and related
      matters

.
      A
      significant number of our telephone subsidiaries recover a portion of their
      costs from the federal Universal Service Fund (the “USF”) and from similar state
“universal support” mechanisms. Disbursements from these programs traditionally
      have allowed LECs serving small communities and rural areas to provide
      communications services on terms and at prices reasonably comparable to those
      available in urban areas. A significant portion of our support payments vary
      over time based on our average cost to serve customers compared to national
      cost
      averages. The table below sets forth the amounts received by our telephone
      subsidiaries in 2005 and 2004 from federal and state universal support
      programs.

As
      mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal
      service support mechanism for rural telephone companies by adopting an interim
      mechanism for a five-year period, which ends June 30, 2006, based on embedded,
      or historical, costs that provides relatively predictable levels of support
      to
      many LECs, including substantially all of our LECs.

Wireless
      and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible
      telecommunications carrier (“ETC”) status in order to receive USF support,
      which, coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed
      stress on the USF’s funding mechanism. These developments have placed additional
      financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to
      provide support to all eligible service providers, including support payments
      we
      receive from the USF High Cost Loop support program. As a result of the
      continued increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to
      allocate funds among all recipients (caused by a decrease in the size of the
      High Cost Loop support program and increases in requests for support from the
      USF), we believe our total payments from the USF will continue to decline in
      the
      near term under the FCC’s current rules. Based on recent FCC filings, we
      anticipate our 2006 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will
      be
      approximately $8-12 million lower than 2005 levels due to increases in the
      nationwide average cost per loop factor.

In
      late
      2002, the FCC requested that the Federal-State Joint Board (“FSJB”) on Universal
      Service review various FCC rules governing high cost universal service support,
      including rules regarding eligibility to receive support payments in markets
      served by LECs and competitive carriers. In early 2003, the FSJB issued a notice
      for public comment on whether present rules fulfill their purpose or should
      be
      modified. In early 2004, the FSJB recommended a comprehensive general review
      of
      the high-cost support mechanisms for rural and non-rural carriers, coupled
      with
      more specific recommendations on the process of designating ETCs and disbursing
      support payments. On August 16, 2004, the FSJB released a notice requesting
      comments on the FCC’s current rules for the provision of high-cost support for
      rural companies, including comments on whether eligibility requirements should
      be amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as
      us.
      In addition, the FCC has taken various other steps in anticipation of
      restructuring universal service support mechanisms, including opening a docket
      that will change the method of funding contributions. The FCC is expected to
      issue soon an order addressing a new type of contribution methodology. In the
      event that does not happen, we believe, but cannot assure you, that the FCC
      will
      likely extend the interim mechanism now in place before it lapses on June 30,
      2006.

In
      August
      2005, the FSJB sought comments on four separate proposals to modify the
      distribution of High Cost Loop support funds. Each of the proposals provides
      the
      state public service commissions a greater role in the support distribution
      process, which would remain subject to specific FCC guidelines. Due to the
      pending nature of these proposals, we cannot estimate the impact, if any, that
      such proposals would have on our operations. In addition, there are a number
      of
      judicial appeals challenging several aspects of the FCC’s universal service
      rules and various Congressional proposals seeking to substantially modify USF
      programs, all of which create additional uncertainty regarding our future
      receipt of support payments. We have been and will continue to be active in
      monitoring these developments.

In
      2004,
      the FCC mandated changes in the administration of the universal service support
      programs that temporarily suspended the disbursement of funds under the USF’s
      E-rate program (for service to Schools and Libraries), and, more significantly,
      created questions that these administrative changes could similarly delay the
      disbursement of funds to LECs from the Universal Service High Cost Loop support
      program. In December 2004, Congress passed a bill that granted the USF a
      one-year exemption from the federal law that impacted the E-rate program. In
      April 2005, the Chairman of the FCC publicly stated that the USF’s High Cost
      Loop support program complies with the applicable rules regarding the
      appropriate disbursement of funds. In December 2005, Congress passed a bill
      that
      granted the USF a further one-year exemption from these administrative
      requirements.

In
      the
      second quarter of 2005, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (“LPSC”) adopted
      an order that transferred the existing $42 million Louisiana Optional Service
      Fund (“LOS Fund”) into a state universal service fund effective August 31, 2005.
      In recent years we received approximately $21 million annually from the LOS
      Fund, and we expect to receive similar amounts under the new fund. The new
      state
      universal service fund expands the base of contributors to all
      telecommunications service providers operating in the state. In June 2005,
      two
      telecommunications service providers served the LPSC with an appeal (currently
      pending review by the Louisiana Supreme Court) of the new fund. As such, there
      can be no assurance that the new fund will remain as adopted by the LPSC or
      that
      funding levels will remain at current levels.

Some
      of
      our telephone subsidiaries operate in states where traditional cost recovery
      mechanisms, including rate structures, are under evaluation or have been
      modified. See “- State Regulation.” There can be no assurance that these states
      will continue to provide for cost recovery at current levels.

All
      of
      our interstate network access revenues are based on access charges, cost
      separation studies or special settlement arrangements, many of which are
      administered by the FCC or NECA. See “- Services.”

Certain
      long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce
      intrastate access tariffed rates. Long distance carriers have also aggressively
      pursued regulatory or legislative changes that would reduce access rates. See
      “-Services - Network Access” above for additional information.

Developments
      affecting competition

.
      The
      communications industry continues to undergo fundamental technological,
      regulatory and legislative changes which are likely to significantly impact
      the
      future operations and financial performance of all communications companies.
      Primarily as a result of regulatory and technological changes, competition
      has
      been introduced and encouraged in each sector of the telephone industry in
      recent years. As a result, we increasingly face competition from other
      communication service providers.

Wireless
      telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition
      with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete
      effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services.
      As a
      result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional
      wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service. This trend
      is more pronounced among residential customers, which comprise 75% of our access
      line customers. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless
      service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates,
      improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new services. Most
      of
      our access line customers are currently capable of receiving wireless services
      from a competitive service provider. Technological and regulatory developments
      in cellular telephone, personal communications services, digital microwave,
      satellite, coaxial cable, fiber optics, local multipoint distribution services
      and other wired and wireless technologies are expected to further permit the
      development of alternatives to traditional landline services. In late 2005,
      we
      began offering our CenturyTel branded wireless reseller service in select
      markets and expect to expand such offering to other markets in the near
      future.

The
      Act, which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities
      to the LEC’s network and to take various other steps that are designed to
      promote competition, imposes several duties on a LEC if it receives a specific
      request from another entity which seeks to connect with or provide services
      using the LEC’s network. In addition, each incumbent LEC is obligated to (i)
      negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide
      nondiscriminatory “unbundled” access to all aspects of the LEC’s network, (iii)
      offer resale of its telecommunications services at wholesale rates and (iv)
      permit competitors, on terms and conditions (including rates) that are just,
      reasonable and nondiscriminatory, to collocate their physical plant on the
      LEC’s
      property, or provide virtual collocation if physical collocation is not
      practicable. During 2003, the FCC released new rules outlining the obligations
      of incumbent LECs to lease to competitors elements of their circuit-switched
      networks on an unbundled basis at prices that substantially limited the
      profitability of these arrangements to incumbent LECs. On March 2, 2004, a
      federal appellate court vacated significant portions of these rules, including
      the standards used to determine which unbundled network elements must be made
      available to competitors. In response to this court decision, on February 4,
      2005, the FCC released rules (effective March 11, 2005) that required incumbent
      LECs to lease a network element only in those situations where competing
      carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network element,
      and
      where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of
      facilities-based competition. These rules are further designed to remove
      unbundling obligations over time as competing carriers deploy their own networks
      and local exchange competition increases.

Under
      the
      1996 Act’s rural telephone company exemption, approximately 50% of our telephone
      access lines are exempt from certain of the 1996 Act’s interconnection
      requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission
      overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request
      meeting certain criteria. States are permitted to adopt laws or regulations
      that
      provide for greater competition than is mandated under the 1996 Act. While
      competition through use of our network is still limited in most of our markets,
      we expect to receive additional interconnection requests in the future from
      a
      variety of resellers and facilities-based service providers.

In
      addition to these changes in federal regulation, all of the 22 states in which
      we provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps to
      further introduce competition into the LEC business.

As
      a
      result of these regulatory developments, ILECs increasingly face competition
      from competitive local exchange carriers (“CLECs”), particularly in high
      population areas. CLECs provide competing services through reselling the ILECs’
local services, through use of the ILECs’ unbundled network elements or through
      their own facilities. The number of companies which have requested authorization
      to provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent
      years, especially in our Verizon markets acquired in 2002 and 2000. We
      anticipate that similar action may be taken by other competitors in the future,
      especially if all forms of federal support available to ILECs continue to remain
      available to these competitors.

Technological
      developments have led to the development of new services that compete with
      traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable
      television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone service
      over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have
      aggressively pursued this opportunity. Recently several large electric utilities
      have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with LECs.
      Recent improvements in the quality of "Voice-over-Internet Protocol" ("VoIP")
      service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications
      companies, as well as start-up companies, to substantially increase their
      offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers
      route calls partially or wholly over the Internet, without use of ILEC's circuit
      switches and, in certain cases, without use of ILEC's networks to carry their
      communications traffic. VoIP providers use existing broadband networks to
      deliver flat-rate, all distance calling plans that may offer features that
      cannot readily be provided by traditional LECs. These plans may also be priced
      below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone
      services for several reasons, including lower network cost structures and the
      current ability of VoIP providers to use ILECs’ networks without paying access
      charges. In December 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking that is expected to
      address the effect of VoIP on intercarrier compensation, universal service
      and
      emergency services. On March 10, 2004, the FCC released a notice of proposed
      rulemaking seeking comment on the appropriate regulatory treatment of VoIP
      service and related issues. Although the FCC’s rulemaking regarding VoIP-enabled
      services remains pending, the FCC has adopted orders establishing broad
      guidelines for the regulation of such services, including (i) an April 2004
      order that found an IP-telephony service using the public switched telephone
      network to be a regulated telecommunications service subject to interstate
      access charges, (ii) a November 2004 order that Internet-based services provided
      by Vonage Holdings Corporation should be subject to federal rather than state
      regulation and (iii) a June 2005 order requiring all VoIP service providers
      whose services are interconnected to the public switched telephone network
      to
      provide E-911 services to their customers. In addition, in March 2005, Level
      Communications, Inc. withdrew its petition requesting the FCC to forbear from
      imposing interstate and intrastate access charges on Internet-based calls that
      originate or terminate on the public switched telephone network. There can
      be no
      assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that
      VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers.

Similar
      to us, many cable, entertainment, technology or other communications companies
      that previously offered a limited range of services are now offering diversified
      bundles of services, either through their own networks, reselling arrangements
      or joint ventures. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to
      serve
      the communications needs of the same customer base. Such activities will
      continue to place downward pressure on the demand for our access
      lines.

In
      addition to facing direct competition from those providers described above,
      ILECs increasingly face competition from alternate communication systems
      constructed by long distance carriers, large customers or alternative access
      vendors. These systems, which have become more prevalent as a result of the
      Act, are capable of originating or terminating calls without use of the ILECs’
networks or switching services. Other potential sources of competition include
      noncarrier systems that are capable of bypassing ILECs’ local networks, either
      partially or completely, through substitution of special access for switched
      access or through concentration of telecommunications traffic on a few of the
      ILECs’ access lines. We anticipate that all these trends will continue and lead
      to increased competition with our LECs.

Significant
      competitive factors in the local telephone industry include pricing, packaging
      of services and features, quality and convenience of service and meeting
      customer needs such as simplified billing and timely response to service
      calls.

As
      the
      telephone industry increasingly experiences competition, the size and resources
      of each respective competitor may increasingly influence its prospects. Many
      companies currently providing or planning to provide competitive communication
      services have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than
      we do
      or own larger or more diverse networks than ours. In addition, most of them
      are
      not subject to the same regulatory constraints as we are.

We
      anticipate that the traditional operations of LECs will continue to be impacted
      by continued regulatory and technological developments affecting the ability
      of
      LECs to attract and retain customers and the capability of wireless companies,
      long distance companies, CLECs, cable television companies, VoIP providers,
      electric utilities and others to provide competitive LEC services. Competition
      relating to traditional LEC services has thus far affected large urban areas
      to
      a greater extent than rural, suburban and small urban areas such as those in
      which we operate. We intend to actively monitor these developments, to observe
      the effect of emerging competitive trends in larger markets and to continue
      to
      evaluate new business opportunities that may arise out of future technological,
      legislative and regulatory developments.

While
      we
      expect our operating revenues in 2006 to continue to experience downward
      pressure primarily due to continued access line losses and reduced network
      access revenues, we expect such declines to be partially offset primarily due
      to
      increased demand for our fiber transport, DSL and other nonregulated product
      offerings (including our new video and wireless initiatives mentioned
      above).

Regulation
      and Competition Relating to Other Operations

Long
      Distance Operations

.
      We
      offer intra-LATA, intrastate and interstate long distance services. State public
      service commissions generally regulate intra-LATA toll calls within the same
      LATA and inter-LATA toll calls between different LATAs located in the same
      state. Federal regulators have jurisdiction over interstate toll calls. Recent
      state regulatory changes have increased competition to provide intra-LATA toll
      services in our local exchange markets. Competition for intrastate and
      interstate long distance services has been intense for several years, and
      focuses primarily on price and pricing plans, and secondarily on customer
      service, reliability and communications quality. Traditionally, our principal
      competitors for providing long distance services were AT&T, MCI, Sprint,
      regional phone companies and dial-around resellers. Increasingly, however,
      we
      have experienced competition from newer sources, including wireless and
      high-speed broadband providers, and as a result of technological substitutions,
      including VoIP and electronic mail.

Data
      Operations

.
      In
      connection with our data business, we face competition from Internet service
      providers, satellite companies and cable companies which offer both dial-up
      Internet access services and high-speed broadband services. As of December
      31,
      2005, we believe approximately 54% of our local exchange markets are overlapped
      by Internet-operable cable systems. Many of these competitors offer content
      and
      other support services that we cannot match. Moreover, many of these providers
      have traditionally been subject to less rigorous regulatory scrutiny than our
      subsidiaries and, unlike us, were not required to offer broadband access on
      a
      stand-alone basis to competitors. In September 2005, however, the FCC released
      an order (effective on November 16, 2005) declaring that facilities-based
      wireline broadband Internet access service is an “information service” and
      should be regulated in a manner similar to the largely unregulated broadband
      Internet access services offered by cable companies. One year after the order’s
      effective date, we will no longer be obligated to continue offering broadband
      access on a stand-alone basis to competing unaffiliated Internet service
      providers. In addition, this order preserves the current method of assessing
      universal service contributions on DSL revenues for a 270-day period after
      the
      effective date of the order, or until the FCC adopts a new contribution
      methodology to the universal service fund. The FCC is currently conducting
      several other rulemakings considering the regulatory treatment of broadband
      services, the outcomes of which could significantly impact our competitive
      position.

Fiber
      Transport Operations

.
      When
      our fiber transport networks are used to provide intrastate telecommunications
      services, we must comply with state requirements for telecommunications
      utilities, including state tariffing requirements. To the extent our facilities
      are used to provide interstate communications, we are subject to federal
      regulation as a non-dominant common carrier. Due largely to excess capacity,
      the
      fiber transport industry is highly competitive. Our primary competitors are
      from
      other communications companies, many of whom operate networks and have resources
      much larger than ours. In addition, new IP-based services may enable new
      entrants to transport data at prices lower than we currently offer.

CLEC
      Operations

.
      Competitive local exchange carriers are subject to certain reporting and other
      regulatory requirements by the FCC and state public service commissions,
      although the degree of regulation is much less substantial than that imposed
      on
      ILECs operating in the same markets. Local governments also frequently require
      competitive local exchange carriers to obtain licenses or franchises regulating
      the use of rights-of-way necessary to install and operate their networks. In
      each of our CLEC markets, we face competition from the ILEC, which traditionally
      has long-standing relationships with its customers. Over time, we may also
      face
      competition from one or more other CLECs, or from other communications providers
      who can provide comparable services.

OTHER
        DEVELOPMENTS

In
      February 2006, our board of directors approved a $1.0 billion stock repurchase
      program. We purchased the first $500 million of common stock in late February
      2006 under accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks and,
      later this year, we expect to commence repurchasing the $500 million balance
      of
      the $1.0 billion program through open market or privately negotiated
      transactions, or another accelerated share repurchase program. We previously
      repurchased approximately $401.0 million, $186.7 million and $437.5 million
      of
      our shares under separate repurchase programs approved in February 2004,
      February 2005 and May 2005, respectively. For additional information, see
      Liquidity and Capital Resources included in Item 7 of this report.

            FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

Risk
        Factors

Any
        of
        the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
        financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. The risks
        described below are not the only risks facing us. Please be aware that
        additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
        currently deem to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect
        our
        business operations.

Risks
        Related to Our Business

We
        face competition, which could adversely affect us.

As
        a
        result of various technological, regulatory and other changes, the
        telecommunications industry has become increasingly competitive, and we expect
        these trends to continue. As we discuss further below, competition has resulted
        in access line losses, which we expect will accelerate in 2006. In our LEC
        markets, we face competition from wireless telephone services, which we expect
        to increase if wireless providers continue to expand and improve their network
        coverage, lower their prices and offer enhanced services. In certain of our
        LEC
        markets, we face competition from cable television operators and CLECs. Over
        time, we expect to face additional local exchange competition from more recent
        market entrants, including VoIP providers and electric utilities, and we
        expect
        continued competition from alternative networks or non-carrier systems designed
        to reduce demand for our switching or access services. The Internet, long
        distance and data services markets are also highly competitive, and we expect
        that competition will intensify in these and other markets that we
        serve.

We
        expect
        competition to intensify as a result of new competitors and the development
        of
        new technologies, products and services. We cannot predict which future
        technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive
        position or what funding will be required to develop and provide these
        technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will
        depend on how well we market our products and services and on our ability
        to
        anticipate and respond to various competitive and technological factors
        affecting the industry, including changes in regulation (which may affect
        us
        differently from our competitors), changes in consumer preferences or
        demographics, and changes in the product offerings or pricing strategies
        of our
        competitors.

Many
        of
        our current and potential competitors have market presence, engineering,
        technical and marketing capabilities and financial, personnel and other
        resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of our competitors
        own larger and more diverse networks, can conduct operations or raise capital
        at
        a lower cost than we can, are subject to less regulation, have lower benefit
        plan costs, or have substantially stronger brand names. Consequently, some
        competitors may be able to charge lower prices for their products and services,
        to offer more attractive service bundles, to develop and expand their
        communications and network infrastructures more quickly, to adapt more swiftly
        to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and
        to
        devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and
        services than we can.

Competition
        could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers
        and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage
        of our
        services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii) our need to lower
        prices
        or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (iv) our inability
        to
        diversify by successfully offering new products or services.

We
        could be harmed by rapid changes in technology.

The
        communications industry is experiencing significant technological changes,
        particularly in the areas of VoIP, data transmission and wireless
        communications. Recently, several large electric utilities have announced
        plans
        to offer communications services that compete with LECs. Some of our competitors
        may enjoy network advantages that will enable them to provide services more
        efficiently or at lower cost. Rapid changes in technology could result in
        the
        development of products or services that compete with or displace those offered
        by traditional LECs. We may not be able to obtain timely access to new
        technology on satisfactory terms or incorporate new technology into our systems
        in a cost effective manner, or at all. If we cannot develop new products
        to keep
        pace with technological advances, or if such products are not widely embraced
        by
        our customers, we could be adversely impacted.

We
        cannot assure you that our business will grow or that our diversification
        efforts will be successful.

Due
        to
        the above-cited changes, the telephone industry has recently experienced
        a
        decline in access lines, intrastate minutes of use and long distance minutes
        of
        use. While we have not in the past suffered as much as a number of other
        ILECs
        from recent industry challenges, the recent decline in access lines and usage,
        coupled with the other changes resulting from competitive, technological
        and
        regulatory developments, could materially adversely effect our core business
        and
        future prospects. Our access lines declined 4.3% in 2005 and we expect our
        access lines to decline between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2006. We also earned less
        intrastate revenues in 2005 due to reductions in intrastate minutes of use
        (partially due to the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, electronic
        mail and other optional calling services). We believe our intrastate minutes
        of
        use will continue to decline, although the magnitude of such decrease is
        uncertain.

Until
        recently, we have traditionally sought growth largely through acquisitions
        of
        properties similar to those currently operated by us. However, we cannot
        assure
        you that properties will be available for purchase on terms attractive to
        us,
        particularly if they are burdened by regulations, pricing plans or competitive
        pressures that are new or different from those historically applicable to
        our
        incumbent properties. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able
        to
        arrange additional financing on terms acceptable to us.

In
        recent
        years, we have attempted to broaden our service and product offerings. During
        2005, we began providing co-branded satellite television services and reselling
        wireless services as part of our bundled product and service offerings. Our
        reliance on other companies and their networks to provide these services
        could
        constrain our flexibility and limit the profitability of these new offerings.
        In
        addition, we recently launched our facilities-based digital video offering
        to
        select markets in Wisconsin. We anticipate these new offerings will dilute
        our
        earnings for 2006 by approximately $.06 to $.08 per share and will provide
        lower
        profit margins than many of our traditional services. As such, to the extent
        revenues from these new offerings replace revenues lost from declines in
        our
        traditional LEC business, our overall profit margins will decline. We cannot
        assure you that our recent diversification efforts will be
        successful.

Future
        deterioration in our financial performance could adversely impact our credit
        ratings, our cost of capital and our access to the capital markets.

Our
        future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our
        operations.

In
        the
        past few years, we have expanded our operations through acquisitions and
        new
        product and service offerings, and we may pursue similar growth opportunities
        in
        the future. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage
        our
        expansion opportunities, including our ability to:

·

retain
                  and attract technological, managerial and other key personnel

·

effectively
                  manage our day to day operations while attempting to execute our
                  business
                  strategy of expanding our emerging
                  businesses

·

realize
                  the projected growth and revenue targets developed by management
                  for our
                  newly acquired and emerging businesses,
                  and

·

continue
                  to identify new acquisition or growth opportunities that we can
                  finance,
                  consummate and operate on attractive terms.

Expansion
        opportunities pose substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations
        into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to successfully
        monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality,
        and to
        maintain other necessary internal controls. We cannot assure you that these
        efforts will be successful, or that we will realize our expected operating
        efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits.
        If we are not able to meet these challenges effectively, our results of
        operations may be harmed.

Network
        disruptions could adversely affect our operating
        results.

To
        be
        successful, we will need to continue providing our customers with a high
        capacity, reliable and secure network. Some of the risks to our network and
        infrastructure include:

·

power
                  losses or physical damage to our access lines, whether caused by
                  fire,
                  adverse weather conditions, terrorism or
                  otherwise

·

capacity
                  limitations

·

software
                  and hardware defects

·

breaches
                  of security, including sabotage, tampering, computer viruses and
                  break-ins, and

·

other
                  disruptions that are beyond our
                  control.

Disruptions
        or system failures may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity
        for
        customers. If service is not restored in a timely manner, agreements with
        our
        customers or service standards set by state regulatory commissions could
        obligate us to provide credits or other remedies, and this would reduce our
        revenues or increase our costs. Service disruptions could also damage our
        reputation with customers, causing us to lose existing customers or have
        difficulty attracting new ones.

Any
        failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure could
        harm
        our business.

The
        capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware
        and
        software infrastructure (including our billing systems) is important to the
        operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system
        failures. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology
        infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs are important
        to the
        continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability
        to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse
        consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service
        offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development
        resources.

We
        rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors to operate our
        business.

We
        depend
        on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating
        to our network infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions
        or
        other problems delivering these network components to us on a timely basis,
        our
        operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary technology
        of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may have limited
        flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative suppliers.
        We
        also rely on a limited number of other communications companies in connection
        with reselling long distance, wireless and satellite entertainment services
        to
        our customers. In addition, we rely on a limited number of software vendors
        to
        support our business management systems. In the event it becomes necessary
        to
        seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory
        replacement supplies or services on economically attractive terms, on a timely
        basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our
        services.

Our
        relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations
        and their financial difficulties may adversely affect
        us.

We
        originate and terminate calls for long distance carriers and other interexchange
        carriers over our network in exchange for access charges that represent a
        significant portion of our revenues. Should these carriers go bankrupt or
        experience substantial financial difficulties, our inability to timely collect
        access charges from them could have a negative effect on our business and
        results of operations.

We
        depend on key members of our senior management team.

Our
        success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of a limited
        number of senior officers, none of whom are parties to employment agreements.
        Competition for senior management in our industry is intense and we may have
        difficulty retaining our current senior managers or attracting new ones in
        the
        event of terminations or resignations.

We
        could be affected by certain changes in labor
        matters.

At
        December 31, 2005, approximately 26% of our employees were members of 12
        separate bargaining units represented by two different unions. From time
        to
        time, our labor agreements with these unions lapse, and we typically negotiate
        the terms of new agreements. We cannot predict the outcome of these
        negotiations. We may be unable to reach new agreements, and union employees
        may
        engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially
        disrupt our ability to provide services. In addition, new labor agreements
        may
        impose significant new costs on us, which could impair our financial condition
        or results of operations in the future. Moreover, our post-employment benefit
        offerings cause us to incur costs not faced by many of our competitors, which
        could ultimately hinder our competitive position.

Risks
        Related to Our Regulatory Environment

Our
        revenues could be materially reduced or our expenses materially increased
        by
        changes in regulations.

The
        majority of our revenues are substantially dependent upon regulations which,
        if
        changed, could result in material revenue reductions. Laws and regulations
        applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in
        the
        courts, and could be changed by federal or state legislators. Any of the
        following could significantly impact us:

Risk
        of loss or reduction of network access charge revenues.

A
        significant portion of our network access revenues are paid to us by intrastate
        and interstate long distance carriers for originating and terminating calls
        in
        the regions we serve. The amount of access charge revenues that we receive
        is
        based largely on rates set by federal and state regulatory bodies, and such
        rates could change. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation
        proceeding that is expected to overhaul the current system for compensating
        carriers originating, terminating, carrying and delivering telecommunications
        traffic. This proceeding could materially impact our results of operations.
        In
        addition, our financial results could be harmed if carriers that use our
        access
        services become financially distressed or bypass our networks, either due
        to
        changes in regulation or other factors. Furthermore, access charges currently
        paid to us could be diverted to competitors who enter our markets or expand
        their operations, either due to changes in regulation or otherwise.

Risk
        of loss or reduction of support fund payments.

We
        receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the federal Universal
        Service
        Fund and, to a lesser extent, intrastate support funds. These governmental
        programs are reviewed and amended from time to time, and we cannot assure
        you
        that they will not be changed or impacted in a manner adverse to us. In August
        2004, a federal-state joint board requested comments on the FCC’s current rules
        for high-cost support payments to rural telephone companies, including comments
        on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would
        adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us. In August 2005, this board
        sought
        comments on proposals to modify the distribution of certain key federal support
        funds. Pending judicial appeals and Congressional proposals create additional
        uncertainty regarding our future receipt of support payments. We cannot estimate
        the impact that these developments will have on us.

Recent
        changes in the nationwide average cost per loop factors used by the FCC to
        allocate support funds have reduced our receipts from the main support program
        administered by the federal Universal Service Fund. These changes reduced
        our
        receipts from such program by $13.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004, and
        we
        expect these changes will further reduce our receipts from such program by
        approximately $8 to $12 million in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, the
        number of eligible telecommunications carriers receiving support payments
        from
        this program continues to increase, which, coupled with other factors, is
        placing additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary
        and available to provide support payments to all eligible recipients, including
        us. As a result of the continued increases in the nationwide average cost
        per
        loop factor (caused by a decrease in the size of the USF High Cost
        Loop support program and increases in requests for support from the Universal
        Service Fund), we believe the aggregate level of payments we receive from
        the
        Universal Service Fund will continue to decline in the near term under the
        FCC’s
        current rules.

Risk
        of loss of statutory exemption from burdensome interconnection rules imposed
        on
        incumbent local exchange carriers

.
        Approximately 50% of our telephone access lines are exempt from the 1996
        Act’s
        more burdensome requirements governing the rights of competitors to interconnect
        to incumbent local exchange carrier networks and to utilize discrete network
        elements of the incumbent’s network at favorable rates. If state regulators
        decide that it is in the public’s interest to impose these more burdensome
        interconnection requirements on us, we would be required to provide unbundled
        network elements to competitors. As a result, more competitors could enter
        our
        traditional telephone markets than we currently expect, resulting in lower
        revenues and higher additional administrative and regulatory
        expenses.

Risk
        of losses from earnings reviews

.
        Notwithstanding the movement toward alternative state regulation, LECs operating
        approximately 38% of our total access lines continue to be subject to “rate of
        return” regulation for intrastate purposes. These LECs remain subject to the
        powers of state regulatory commissions to conduct earnings reviews and adjust
        service rates, which could lead to revenue reductions.

Risks
        posed by costs of regulatory compliance

.
        Regulations continue to create significant compliance costs for us. Challenges
        to our tariffs by regulators or third parties or delays in obtaining
        certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial
        legal and administrative expenses, and, if successful, such challenges could
        adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. Our
        business also may be impacted by legislation and regulation imposing new
        or
        greater obligations related to assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland
        security, minimizing environmental impacts, or addressing other issues that
        impact our business. For example, existing provisions of the Communications
        Assistance for Law Enforcement Act require communications carriers to ensure
        that their equipment, facilities, and services are able to facilitate authorized
        electronic surveillance. We expect our compliance costs to increase if future
        legislation or regulations continue to increase our obligations to assist
        other
        governmental agencies.

Regulatory
        changes in the communications industry could adversely affect our business
        by
        facilitating greater competition against us.

The
        Act provides for significant changes and increased competition in the
        communications industry, including the local communications and long distance
        industries. This Act and the FCC’s implementing regulations remain subject to
        judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus making it difficult to predict
        what effect the legislation will have on us and our competitors. Several
        regulatory and judicial proceedings have recently concluded, are underway
        or may
        soon be commenced, that address issues affecting our operations and those
        of our
        competitors. Moreover, certain communities nationwide have expressed an interest
        in establishing a municipal telephone utility that would compete for customers.
        We cannot predict the outcome of these developments, nor can we assure that
        these changes will not have a material adverse effect on us or our
        industry.

We
        are subject to significant regulations that limit our
        flexibility.

As
        a
        diversified full service incumbent local exchange carrier, or ILEC, we have
        traditionally been subject to significant regulation that does not apply
        to many
        of our competitors. For instance, unlike many of our competitors, we are
        subject
        to federal mandates to share facilities, file and justify tariffs, maintain
        certain accounts and file reports, and state requirements that obligate us
        to
        maintain service standards and limit our ability to change tariffs in a timely
        manner. This regulation imposes substantial compliance costs on us and restricts
        our ability to raise rates, to compete and to respond rapidly to changing
        industry conditions. Although newer alternative forms of regulation permit
        us
        greater freedoms in several states in which we operate, they nonetheless
        typically impose caps on the rates that we can charge our customers. As our
        business becomes increasingly competitive, regulatory disparities between
        us and
        our competitors could impede our ability to compete. Litigation and different
        objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and
        impede our ability to respond to new regulations. Moreover, changes in tax
        laws,
        regulations or policies could increase our tax rate, particularly if state
        regulators continue to search for additional revenue sources to address budget
        shortfalls. We are unable to predict the future actions of the various
        regulatory bodies that govern us, but such actions could materially affect
        our
        business.

For
        a
        more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business,
        see “- Operations” above.

Other
        Risks

We
        have a substantial amount of indebtedness.

We
        have a
        substantial amount of indebtedness. This could hinder our ability to adjust
        to
        changing market and economic conditions, as well as our ability to access
        the
        capital markets to refinance maturing debt in the ordinary course of business.
        In connection with executing our business strategies, we are continuously
        evaluating the possibility of acquiring additional communications assets,
        and we
        may elect to finance acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness.
        Moreover, to respond to the competitive challenges discussed above, we may
        be
        required to raise substantial additional capital to finance new product or
        service offerings. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend
        on,
        among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as
        prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot
        assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms
        acceptable to us or at all. If we are able to obtain additional financing,
        our
        credit ratings could be adversely affected. As a result, our borrowing costs
        would likely increase, our access to capital may be adversely affected and
        our
        ability to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness could be
        adversely affected.

Our
        agreements and organizational documents and applicable law could limit another
        party’s ability to acquire us at a premium.

Under
        our
        articles of incorporation, each share of common stock that has been beneficially
        owned by the same person or entity continually since May 30, 1987 generally
        entitles the holder to ten votes on all matters duly submitted to a vote
        of
        shareholders. As of February 28, 2006, the holders of our ten-vote shares
        held
        approximately 41% of our total voting power. In addition, a number of other
        provisions in our agreements and organizational documents, including our
        shareholder rights plan, and various provisions of applicable law may delay,
        defer or prevent a future takeover of CenturyTel unless the takeover is approved
        by our board of directors. This could deprive our shareholders of any related
        takeover premium.

We
        face other risks.

The
        list
        of risks above is not exhaustive, and you should be aware that we face various
        other risks. For a description of additional risks, please see “- Operations”
above, “ - Forward-Looking Statements” below, and the other items of this annual
        report, particularly Items 3, 7 and 8.

Forward-Looking
        Statements

This
        report on Form 10-K and other documents filed by us under the federal securities
        laws include, and future oral or written statements or press releases by
        us and
        our management may include, certain forward-looking statements, including
        without limitation statements with respect to our anticipated future operating
        and financial performance, financial position and liquidity, growth
        opportunities and growth rates, acquisition and divestiture opportunities,
        business prospects, regulatory and competitive outlook, investment and
        expenditure plans, investment results, financing opportunities and sources
        (including the impact of financings on our financial position, financial
        performance or credit ratings), pricing plans, strategic alternatives, business
        strategies, and other similar statements of expectations or objectives or
        accompanying statements of assumptions that are highlighted by words such
        as
“expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “projects,” “seeks,”
“estimates,” “hopes,” “should,” “could,” and “may,” and variations thereof and
        similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are based upon our judgment
        and assumptions as of the date such statements are made concerning future
        developments and events, many of which are outside of our control. These
        forward-looking statements, and the assumptions upon which such statements

        could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected
        in
        our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise
        any of our forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result
        of new
        information, future events or developments, changed circumstances, or
        otherwise.

Investors
        should also be aware that while we do, at various times, communicate with
        securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to them any material
        non-public information or other confidential information. Accordingly, investors
        should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by an
        analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent
        that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts
        or
        opinions, such reports are not our responsibility.

OTHER
        MATTERS

We
        have
        certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the
        protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2005 have not
        been
        material and we currently have no reason to believe that such costs will
        become
        material.

For
        additional information concerning our business and properties, see Item 7
        elsewhere herein, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes 2,
        4, 5,
        and 16 thereto set forth in Item 8 elsewhere herein.

Item
                  2.

Properties.

Our
        properties consist principally of telephone lines, central office equipment,
        and
        land and buildings related to telephone operations. As of December 31, 2005
        and
        2004, our gross property, plant and equipment of approximately $7.8 billion
        and
        $7.4 billion, respectively, consisted of the following:

“Cable
        and wire” facilities consist primarily of buried cable and aerial cable, poles,
        wire, conduit and drops used in providing local and long distance services.
        “Central office” consists primarily of switching equipment, circuit equipment
        and related facilities. “General support” consists primarily of land, buildings,
        tools, furnishings, fixtures, motor vehicles and work equipment. “Fiber
        transport” consists of network assets and equipment to provide fiber transport
        services. “Construction in progress” includes property of the foregoing
        categories that has not been placed in service because it is still under
        construction.

The
        properties of certain of our telephone subsidiaries are subject to mortgages
        securing the debt of such companies. We own substantially all of the central
        office buildings, local administrative buildings, warehouses, and storage
        facilities used in our telephone operations.

For
        further information on the location and type of our properties, see the
        descriptions of our operations in Item 1.

Legal
                  Proceedings.

In

Barbrasue
          Beattie and James Sovis, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly
          situated, v. CenturyTel, Inc.

,
          filed
          on October 28, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Eastern
          District of Michigan (Case No. 02-10277), the plaintiffs allege that we
          unjustly
          and unreasonably billed customers for inside wire maintenance services,
          and seek
          unspecified money damages and injunctive relief under various legal theories
          on
          behalf of a purported class of over two million customers in our telephone
          markets. On March 10, 2006, the Court certified the class action status
          of the
          suit and issued a ruling that the billing descriptions we used for these
          services during an approximately 18-month period between October 29, 2000
          and
          May 2002 were legally insufficient. We plan to appeal this decision. The
          Court’s
          order does not specify the award of damages, the scope of which remains
          subject
          to significant fact finding. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate
          the
          amount or range of possible loss; however, we believe it to be significantly
          below the level of revenues billed for such services during the above period.
          We
          do not believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will have a
          material
          adverse effect on our financial position or results of
          operations.

From
        time
        to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business,
        including administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating
        primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, occasional
        grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies and miscellaneous third
        party tort actions. The outcome of these other proceedings is not predictable.
        However, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other
        proceedings, after considering available insurance coverage, will have a
        material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
        or cash
        flows.

Common
        stock dividends during 2005 and 2004 were paid each quarter. As of February
        28,
        2006, there were approximately 4,400 stockholders of record of our common
        stock.
        As of March 15, 2006, the closing stock price of our common stock was
        $37.64.

In
        February 2005, our board of directors approved a repurchase program authorizing
        us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200 million of either our common
        stock
        or equity units prior to December 31, 2005 (which was subsequently extended
        to
        February 28, 2006). After we implemented our accelerated share repurchase
        program in May 2005, we did not purchase any securities under our $200 million
        repurchase program from June 2005 through December 2005 (the completion date
        of
        the accelerated share repurchase program). Therefore, no shares were repurchased
        during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the $200 million program. As
        of
        December 31, 2005, we had authority to repurchase approximately $86.0 million
        in
        shares under our $200 million program. In January and February 2006, we
        repurchased approximately $72.6 million in shares (2,144,800 shares at an
        average price per share of $33.86). In February 2006, our board authorized
        a
        $1.0 billion share repurchase program that superseded the remaining portion
        of
        approximately $13 million of our $200 million program. See Note 18 of Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for information
        related to the new share repurchase program.

Management’s
                  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
                  Operations

RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

CenturyTel,
        Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company
        engaged primarily in providing local exchange, long distance, Internet access
        and broadband services to customers in 26 states. We currently derive our
        revenues from providing (i) local exchange telephone services, (ii) network
        access services, (iii) long distance services, (iv) data services, which
        includes both digital subscriber line (“DSL”) and dial-up Internet services, as
        well as special access and private line services, (v) fiber transport,
        competitive local exchange and security monitoring services and (vi) other
        related services.

We
        strive
        to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our
        service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of
        integrated communications services. Effective in the first quarter of 2004,
        as a
        result of our increased focus on integrated bundle offerings and the varied
        discount structures associated with such offerings, we determined that our
        results of operations would be more appropriately reported as a single
        reportable segment under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
        Information.” Therefore, the results of operations for 2005 and 2004 reflect the
        presentation of a single reportable segment. Results of operations for 2003
        have
        been conformed to this presentation of a single reportable segment.

During
        2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom
        Holdings, Inc. (“KMC”) for approximately $75.5 million cash. During 2003, we
        also acquired fiber transport assets in five central U.S. states (which we
        operate under the name LightCore) for $55.2 million cash.

Our
        results of operations in 2005 were adversely impacted as a result of (i)
        lower
        Universal Service Fund and intrastate access revenues, (ii) declines in access
        lines, (iii) incremental amortization and operating expenses related to our
        billing and customer care system and (iv) expenses associated with expanding
        our
        new satellite video and wireless service offerings. See below for additional
        information.

Our
        net
        income for 2005 was $334.5 million, compared to $337.2 million during 2004
        and
        $344.7 million during 2003. Diluted earnings per share for 2005 was $2.49
        compared to $2.41 in 2004 and $2.35 in 2003. The increase in diluted earnings
        per share is attributable to lower average shares outstanding in 2005 compared
        to 2004 due to share repurchases that have occurred during the past two years.
        The diluted earnings per share calculation reflects the application of Emerging
        Issues Task Force No. 04-8 to all periods presented. See Note 12 of Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Operating
        income decreased $17.6 million in 2005 as a $71.9 million increase in operating
        revenues was more than offset by an $89.4 million increase in operating
        expenses. Operating income increased $3.6 million in 2004 as a $39.8 million
        increase in operating revenues was substantially offset by a $36.2 million
        increase in operating expenses.

In
        addition to historical information, this management’s discussion and analysis
        includes certain forward-looking statements that are based on current
        expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and
        assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events and results
        may
        differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or
        more
        of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions
        prove
        incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited
        to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety
        of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change;
        the
        effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry;
        our
        ability to effectively manage our growth, including integrating newly-acquired
        businesses into our operations and hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff;
        possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services;
        our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on
        a
        timely and cost-effective basis; our ability to collect our receivables from
        financially troubled communications companies; our ability to successfully
        negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work
        stoppages; the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time
        to
        time in this report or other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange
        Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest
        rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical
        or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions,
        or in
        legislation, regulation or public policy.

These
        and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater
        detail
        in Item 1A included herein. You should be aware that new factors may emerge
        from
        time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor
        can
        we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to
        which
        any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected
        in any forward-looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place
        undue
        reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the
        date of
        this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward-looking
        statements for any reason.

Local
        service revenues.

We
        derive
        local service revenues by providing local exchange telephone services in
        our
        service areas. The $13.6 million (1.9%) decrease in local service revenues
        in
        2005 is primarily due to (i) a $16.1 million decrease due a 3.3% decline
        in the
        average number of access lines served and (ii) a $7.5 million decline as
        a
        result of a decrease in minutes of use in extended area calling plans in
        certain
        areas. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) an $8.7 million increase
        due
        to our providing custom calling features to more customers and (ii) a $4.2
        million increase due to the mandated implementation of extended area calling
        plans in certain areas. Of the $3.5 million (.5%) increase in local service
        revenues in 2004, $12.6 million was due to the provision of custom calling
        features to more customers, which was partially offset by an $8.4 million
        decrease due to a 2.2% decline in the average number of access lines served.

Access
        lines declined 99,500 (4.3%) during 2005 compared to a decline of 62,500
        (2.6%)
        in 2004. We believe the decline in the number of access lines during 2005
        and
        2004 is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone
        services by other competitive services. Based on current conditions, we expect
        access lines to decline between 4.5% and 5.5% during 2006.

Network
        access revenues.

We
        derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services
        to
        various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities
        to
        originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice and data
        transmissions and (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us
        to
        recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms.
        Certain of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access
        charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”); the
        remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements
        with
        other local exchange carriers (“LECs”) administered by the National Exchange
        Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed
        access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under
        revenue
        sharing arrangements with other LECs.

Network
        access revenues decreased $6.2 million (0.6%) in 2005 and decreased $35.5
        million (3.5%) in 2004 due to the following factors:

As
        indicated in the chart above, in 2005 we experienced a reduction in our
        intrastate revenues of approximately $13.4 million primarily due to (i) a
        reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes
        by
        wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services) and (ii) the
        mandated implementation of extended area calling plans in certain areas.
        The
        corresponding decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was $26.8 million. We believe
        intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2006, although the magnitude
        of
        such decrease is uncertain.

Prior
        year revenue settlement agreements for 2005 included the recognition of
        approximately $35.9 million of revenue (of which $24.5 million was reflected
        in
        network access revenues and $11.4 million was reflected in data revenues)
        as the
        2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on September 30, 2005. See Critical
        Accounting Policies below and Note 17 for additional information. We do not
        expect to recognize this level of revenue related to prior year revenue
        settlement agreements in 2006.

We
        anticipate our 2006 revenues from the federal Universal Service High Cost
        Loop
        support program will be approximately $8-12 million lower than 2005 levels
        due
        to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate
        funds among all recipients.

Long
        distance revenues

.
        We
        derive our long distance revenues by providing retail long distance services
        to
        our customers. Long distance revenues increased $2.9 million (1.5%) and $13.1
        million (7.5%) in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $2.9 million increase
        in 2005
        was primarily attributable to a 12.0% increase in the average number of long
        distance lines served and a 12.8% increase in minutes of use (aggregating
        $21.2
        million), substantially offset by a decrease in the average rate we charged
        our
        customers ($16.5 million). The $13.1 million increase in 2004 was primarily
        attributable to a 14.9% increase in the average number of long distance lines
        served and a 15.3% increase in minutes of use (aggregating $21.7 million),
        partially offset by a decrease in the average rate we charged our customers
        ($9.2 million). We anticipate that increased competition and our current
        level
        of customer penetration will continue to place downward pressure on rates
        and
        slow the growth rate of the number of long distance lines served.

Data
        revenues

.
        We
        derive our data revenues primarily by providing Internet access services
        (both
        DSL and dial-up services) and data transmission services over special circuits
        and private lines. Data revenues increased $43.0 million (15.6%) in 2005
        and
        $30.8 million (12.6%) in 2004. The $43.0 million increase in 2005 was primarily
        due to (i) a $24.8 million increase in Internet revenues due primarily to
        growth
        in the number of DSL customers, partially offset by a decrease in the number
        of
        dial-up customers, (ii) a $10.8 million increase in special access revenues
        due
        to an increase in the number of special circuits provided and an increase
        in the
        partial recovery of our increased operating expenses through revenue sharing
        arrangements with other telephone companies, and (iii) an $8.6 million increase
        in revenues related to prior year settlement agreements (the majority of
        which
        related to the revenue recorded in 2005 as the 2001/2002 monitoring period
        lapsed on September 30, 2005). We do not expect to recognize this level of
        revenue related to prior year revenue settlement agreements in 2006.

The
        $30.8
        million increase in 2004 was primarily due to (i) a $20.3 million increase
        in
        Internet revenues due primarily to growth in the number of DSL customers
        and
        (ii) an $11.3 million increase in special access revenues due to an increase
        in
        the number of special circuits provided and an increase in the partial recovery
        of our increased operating expenses through revenue sharing arrangements
        with
        other telephone companies.

Fiber
        transport and CLEC.

Our
        fiber
        transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport,
        competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) and security monitoring businesses.
        Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $41.0 million (55.2%) in 2005,
        of
        which $27.7 million was due to revenue from the June 30, 2005 acquisition
        of
        fiber assets from KMC and $12.4 million was attributable to growth in the
        number
        of customers in our incumbent fiber transport business. Fiber transport and
        CLEC
        revenues increased $31.4 million (72.9%) in 2004, substantially all of which
        is
        attributable to our acquisitions of fiber transport assets (which are operated
        under the name LightCore) in June and December 2003.

Other
        revenues.

We
        derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and
        maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii)
        providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating
        in the publication of local directories and (iv) offering our new video and
        wireless services. Other revenues increased $4.8 million (2.5%) during 2005
        primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in directory revenues. Other revenues
        decreased $3.5 million (1.8%) during 2004 primarily due to a $3.4 million
        decrease in directory revenues due to the expiration of our rights to share
        in
        the revenues of yellow page directories published in certain markets acquired
        from Verizon in 2002.

Cost of
        services and products increased $66.5 million (8.8%) in 2005 primarily due
        to
        (i) a $21.9 million increase in expenses incurred by the properties acquired
        from KMC in June 2005; (ii) a $16.4 million increase in expenses associated
        with
        our Internet operations primarily due to an increase in the number of DSL
        customers; (iii) a $10.6 million increase in costs associated with growth
        in our
        fiber transport business; (iv) a $9.0 million increase in salaries and benefits;
        (v) an $8.2 million increase in access expenses; (vi) a $5.3 million increase
        due to start-up costs associated with our new satellite video and wireless
        reseller services; and (vii) a $4.3 million increase in costs associated
        with
        growth in our long distance business. Such increases were partially offset
        by
        (i) a $3.9 million decrease in expenses caused by us settling certain pole
        attachment disputes in 2005 for amounts less than those previously accrued
        and
        (ii) a $3.4 million decrease in customer service expense.

Cost
        of
        services and products increased $16.2 million (2.2%) in 2004 primarily due
        to
        (i) a $14.6 million increase in expenses associated with operating our fiber
        transport assets acquired in June and December 2003; (ii) an $8.5 million
        increase in expenses associated with our Internet operations due to an increase
        in the number of customers; (iii) a $7.8 million increase in customer service
        and retention related expenses; and (iv) a $6.0 million increase in plant
        operations expenses. Such increases were partially offset by a $13.8 million
        decrease in access expenses (which included a one-time credit of $3.1 million
        recorded in 2004) and a $9.2 million decrease in the cost of providing retail
        long distance service primarily due to a decrease in the average cost per
        minute
        of use and a decrease in circuit costs.

Selling,
        general and administrative

.
        Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.1 million (2.0%)
        in
        2005 primarily due to (i) a $12.4 million decrease in operating taxes (primarily
        due to an $8.6 million one-time charge in the third quarter of 2004); (ii)
        an
        $11.2 million reduction in bad debt expense, and (iii) a $4.6 million decrease
        in expenses attributable to our Sarbanes-Oxley internal controls compliance
        effort. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) $7.9 million of expenses
        incurred by the properties acquired from KMC; (ii) a $5.9 million increase
        in
        customer service and marketing costs associated with growth in our Internet
        business and (iii) a $2.8 million increase in sales and marketing costs
        associated with our new satellite video and wireless reseller services.

Selling,
        general and administrative expenses increased $22.8 million (6.1%) in 2004
        due
        to (i) a $9.0 million increase in marketing expenses; (ii) a $6.4 million
        increase in expenses attributable to our Sarbanes-Oxley internal controls
        compliance effort; (iii) a nonrecurring $5.0 million reduction in bad debt
        expense recorded in the first quarter of 2003 due to the partial recovery
        of
        amounts previously written off related to the bankruptcy of MCI (formerly
        WorldCom); and (iv) a $4.3 million increase in expenses associated with
        operating our LightCore assets acquired in 2003. Such increases were partially
        offset by a $6.6 million decrease in bad debt expense (exclusive of the MCI
        recovery mentioned above).

Depreciation
        and amortization

.
        Depreciation and amortization increased $31.0 million (6.2%) in 2005. The
        year
        2004 included a one-time reduction in depreciation expense of $13.2 million
        to
        adjust the balances of certain over-depreciated property, plant and equipment
        accounts. The remaining $17.8 million increase in 2005 is primarily due to
        (i) a
        $19.0 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service, (ii) a $6.1
        million increase associated with amortization of our new billing system and
        (iii) a $2.8 million increase due to depreciation and amortization incurred
        by
        the properties acquired from KMC. Such increases were partially offset by
        (i) a
        $7.8 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming
        fully depreciated and (ii) the non-recurrence in 2005 of a $3.1 million one-time
        increase recorded in 2004 related to the depreciation of fixed assets associated
        with our new billing system.

Depreciation
        and amortization decreased $2.7 million (.5%) in 2004. In addition to the
        $13.2
        million reduction in depreciation expense mentioned above, depreciation expense
        for 2004 was also reduced by $8.4 million due to certain assets becoming
        fully
        depreciated. Such decreases were partially offset by a $16.7 million increase
        due to higher levels of plant in service, the above-mentioned $3.1 million
        one-time increase in 2004 related to depreciation of fixed assets related
        to our
        new billing system, and a $3.0 million increase in depreciation due to the
        assets acquired in connection with our LightCore operations.

INTEREST
        EXPENSE

Interest
        expense decreased $9.3 million (4.4%) in 2005 compared to 2004 as a $16.1
        million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding
        was
        partially offset by a $7.7 million increase due to higher average interest
        rates.

Interest
        expense decreased $15.7 million (6.9%) in 2004 compared to 2003 partially
        due to
        $7.5 million of nonrecurring interest expense in 2003 associated with various
        operating tax audits. The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to
        a
        decrease in average debt outstanding.

INCOME
        FROM UNCONSOLIDATED CELLULAR ENTITY

Income
        from unconsolidated cellular entity was $4.9 million in 2005, $7.1 million
        in
        2004 and $6.2 million in 2003. Such income represents our share of income
        from
        our 49% interest in a cellular partnership.

OTHER
        INCOME (EXPENSE)

Other
        income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related
        to
        our core operations, including interest income and allowance for funds used
        during construction. Other income (expense) was $(1.7 million) in 2005, $(2.6
        million) in 2004 and $2.2 million in 2003. The years 2005 and 2004 were impacted
        by certain charges and credits that are not expected to occur in the future.
        Included in 2005 was (i) a $16.2 million pre-tax charge due to the impairment
        of
        a non-operating investment and (ii) a $4.8 million debt extinguishment expense
        related to purchasing and retiring approximately $400 million of Senior J
        notes.
        The year 2005 was favorably impacted by (i) $3.2 million of non-recurring
        interest income related to the settlement of various income tax audits; (ii)
        a
        $3.5 million gain from the sale of a non-operating investment and (iii) $3.9
        million of higher interest income due to higher average cash balances. Included
        in 2004 was a $3.6 million prepayment expense paid in connection with the
        redemption of $100 million aggregate principal amount of our Series B senior
        notes in May 2004 and a $2.5 million charge related to the impairment of
        a
        non-operating investment.

INCOME
        TAX EXPENSE

Our
        effective income tax rate was 37.8%, 38.4% and 35.2% in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
        respectively. Income tax expense for 2005 was increased by $19.5 million
        as a
        result of increasing the valuation allowance related to net state operating
        loss
        carryforwards. This increase was primarily due to changes in state income
        tax
        laws and other factors which impacted the projections of future taxable income.
        This tax expense increase was more than offset by (i) a reduction of state
        income tax reserves ($11.6 million, net of federal income tax benefit); (ii)
        a
        reduction in our composite state income tax rate due to income being apportioned
        to states with lower state tax rates ($8.5 million); and (iii) the favorable
        settlement of various federal income tax audits ($1.3 million).

ACCOUNTING
        PRONOUNCEMENTS

Over
        the
        last several years, we have elected to account for employee stock-based
        compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting
        Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” as
        allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
        Stock-Based Compensation”. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
        Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised
        2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”). SFAS 123(R) establishes standards for the
        accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
        for goods or services, focusing primarily on accounting for transactions
        in
        which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for the issuance of
        stock
        options. SFAS 123(R) requires us to measure the cost of the employee services
        received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the fair
        value of the award on the grant date. Such cost will be recognized as an
        expense
        over the period during which the employee is required to provide service
        in
        exchange for the award. SFAS 123(R) is effective for all awards granted after
        its effective date of January 1, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 123(R),
        compensation cost is also recognized over the applicable remaining vesting
        period for any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date.
        In
        order to eliminate the recognition of compensation expense related to
        outstanding awards that are not fully vested as of January 1, 2006, on December
        14, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved
        accelerating the vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding (which
        totaled approximately 1.5 million options), effective December 31, 2005.
        As a
        result of accelerating the vesting of these options, we will avoid approximately
        $4.9 million of pre-tax compensation expense, of which approximately $4.1
        million would have been recognized in 2006. We recognized approximately $156,000
        of expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of accelerating the
        vesting
        of these options. We expect the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to decrease our diluted
        earnings per share by approximately $.02 to $.03 in 2006.

On
        January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
        143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS 143”), which addresses
        financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with
        the
        retirement of tangible long-lived assets and requires that the fair value
        of a
        liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period
        in
        which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the
        long-lived asset. Although we generally have no legal obligation to remove
        obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory
        authorities for our telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
        Regulation” (“SFAS 71”), have historically included a component for removal
        costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the
        adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this
        accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though
        there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not
        adopt
        the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71.
        For
        our telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 (which are not subject
        to
        SFAS 71) and our other non-regulated operations, we have not accrued a liability
        for anticipated removal costs. For these reasons, the adoption of SFAS 143
        did
        not have a material effect on our financial statements.

On
        March 31, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
        Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”
(“FIN 47”), an interpretation of SFAS 143. FIN 47, which was effective for
        fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, clarifies that the recognition
        and
        measurement provisions of SFAS 143 apply to asset retirement obligations in
        which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event
        that may or may not be within control of the entity. We identified conditional
        asset retirement obligations for (i) asbestos removal in buildings, (ii)
        removal
        of underground storage tanks, (iii) our property located on public and private
        rights-of way and (iv) our property that is attached to poles owned by other
        utilities and municipalities. Due to a lack of historical experience from
        which
        to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, we
        concluded that an asset retirement obligation associated with our property
        located on rights-of-way is indeterminate. We also concluded that our
        conditional asset retirement obligations related to the removal of asbestos,
        underground storage tanks and our property that is attached to other entities’
poles was immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations
        and
        therefore has not been recognized.

In
        the
        fourth quarter of 2004, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force No. 04-8, “The
        Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share”
(“EITF 04-8”). EITF 04-8 requires securities issuable under contingently
        convertible instruments be included in the diluted earnings per share
        calculation. Our $165 million Series K senior notes are convertible into
        common
        stock under various contingent circumstances, including the common stock
        attaining a specified trading price in excess of the notes’ fixed conversion
        price. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, our diluted earnings per
        share
        and diluted shares outstanding reflect the application of EITF 04-8. Prior
        periods have been restated to reflect this change in accounting.

Our
        financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
        that
        are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
        statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
        the
        reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually
        evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue
        recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and
        postretirement benefits, (iv) long-lived assets and (v) income taxes. Actual
        results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that
        certain
        critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity,
        including those described below.

Revenue
        recognition.

Certain
        of our interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed
        access
        charges filed directly with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues is derived
        from revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National
        Exchange Carrier Association.

In
        the
        second quarter of 2004, we revised certain estimates for recognizing interstate
        revenues.

Previously,
        we initially recognized interstate revenues at a rate of return lower than
        the
        authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC to allow for potential decreases
        in demand or other factor changes which could decrease the achieved rate
        of
        return over the respective monitoring periods. As the monitoring periods
        progressed, we recorded additional revenues ratably up to the achieved rate
        of
        return. In the second quarter of 2004, we began generally recognizing such
        interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate of return, unless
        the
        actual achieved rate of return was lower than authorized.

The
        Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access
        tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those
        tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been “deemed lawful” in effect nullify an
        interexchange carrier’s ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the
        tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return
        prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate
        tariffs directly with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since
        July
        2004, we have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since we believe
        such tariffs are “deemed lawful”. There is no assurance that our future tariff
        filings will be “deemed lawful”. For those tariffs that have not yet been
“deemed lawful”, we initially recorded as a liability our earnings in excess of
        the authorized rate of return, and may thereafter recognize as revenue some
        or
        all of these amounts at the end of the applicable settlement period or as
        our
        legal entitlement thereto becomes more certain. We recorded approximately
        $35.9
        million as revenue in the third quarter of 2005 as the settlement period
        related
        to the 2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on September 30, 2005. The amount
        of
        our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability
        on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 for the 2003/2004 monitoring
        period
        aggregated approximately $31.5 million. The settlement period related to
        the
        2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on September 30, 2007. We will continue
        to
        monitor the legal status of any proceedings that could impact our entitlement
        to
        these funds.

Allowance
        for doubtful accounts

.
        In
        evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number
        of
        factors, including a specific customer’s or carrier’s ability to meet its
        financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past
        due
        and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record
        both
        specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce
        the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect
        from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions
        worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, our
        estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further
        reduced from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance
        sheet.

Pension
        and postretirement benefits.

The
        amounts recognized in our financial statements related to pension and
        postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes
        many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption
        used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected
        long-term rate of return on plan assets. For 2005 and 2004, we utilized an
        expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25%, which we believe
        reflects the expected long-term rates of return in the financial markets.

Another
        assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit
        plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. Our discount rate at December
        31, 2005 was 5.5% compared to 5.75% at December 31, 2004, which we believe
        is
        the appropriate rate at which the pension and postretirement benefits could
        be
        effectively settled. Such rates were determined based on a discounted cash
        flow
        analysis of our expected cash outflows of our benefit plans. A 25 basis point
        decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual pension expense
        approximately $1.8 million and increase annual postretirement expense
        approximately $900,000.

Intangible
        and long-lived assets.

We are
        subject to testing for impairment of long-lived assets under two accounting
        standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
        Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), and Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
        Assets” (“SFAS 144”).

SFAS
        requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for
        impairment at least annually and requires write-downs only in periods in
        which
        the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142,
        impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting
        unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value
        of
        the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as
        multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and
        amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying
        value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of
        goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of
        goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to
        its
        implied fair value. We completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment
        (as of September 30, 2005) under SFAS 142 and determined our goodwill is
        not
        impaired as of such date.

Under
        SFAS 144, the carrying value of long-lived assets other than goodwill is
        reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such
        carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of
        the
        carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to
        be
        generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than
        the
        carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the
        carrying value of a long-lived asset over its fair value.

Income
        taxes.

We
        estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of
        the
        future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our
        financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid
        could
        vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the
        resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain
        income
        tax contingency reserves for potential assessments from the various taxing
        authorities. These reserves are estimated based on our judgment of the probable
        outcome of the tax contingencies and are adjusted periodically based on changing
        facts and circumstances. Changes to the tax contingency reserves could
        materially affect operating results in the period of change.

For
        additional information on our critical accounting policies, see “Accounting
        Pronouncements” and “Regulation and Competition - Other Matters” below, and the
        footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
        herein.

INFLATION

Historically,
          we have mitigated the effects of increased costs by recovering over time
          certain
          costs applicable to our regulated telephone operations through the rate-making
          process. However, LECs operating over 60% of our total access lines are
          now
          governed by state alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict
          or delay
          our ability to recover increased costs. Additional future regulatory changes
          may
          further alter our ability to recover increased costs in our regulated
          operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are
          regulated under price-cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes
          are
          limited to the rate of inflation, minus a productivity offset. As operating
          expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of
          inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover
          the
          costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment.

MARKET
          RISK

We
          are
          exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long-term
          debt
          obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis.
          Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed-rate
          debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates.
          Fair
          value of long-term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted
          cash
          flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared
          to
          terms and rates currently available in the long-term financing markets.
          The
          results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented
          below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates.

At
          December 31, 2005, the fair value of our long-term debt was estimated to
          be $2.6
          billion based on the overall weighted average rate of our long-term debt
          of 6.7%
          and an overall weighted maturity of 9 years compared to terms and rates
          available on such date in long-term financing markets. Market risk is estimated
          as the potential decrease in fair value of our long-term debt resulting
          from a
          hypothetical increase of 67 basis points in interest rates (ten percent
          of our
          overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest
          rates
          would result in approximately a $98.2 million decrease in the fair value
          of our
          long-term debt. As of December 31, 2005, after giving effect to interest
          rate
          swaps currently in place, approximately 81% of our long-term debt obligations
          were fixed rate.

We
          seek
          to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort
          to
          limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in
          rates.
          From time to time, we use derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap
          our
          exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates
          or (ii)
          to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates.
          We
          have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval,
          reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not
          hold or
          issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
          We
          periodically review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implement
          strategies to manage the exposure.

At
          December 31, 2005, we had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges
          associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of our
          Series L
          senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These
          hedges are “fixed to variable” interest rate swaps that effectively convert our
          fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations
          to
          pay variable rates that range from the six-month London InterBank Offered
          Rate
          (“LIBOR”) plus 3.229% to the six-month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and
          rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the
          hedges
          in August 2012. At December 31, 2005, we realized a rate under these hedges
          of
          8.25% and for 2005 we realized an average interest rate of 7.80%. Interest
          expense was reduced by $386,000 during 2005 as a result of these hedges.
          The
          aggregate fair market value of these hedges was $17.6 million at December
          31,
          2005 and is reflected both as a liability and as a decrease in our underlying
          long-term debt on the December 31, 2005 balance sheet. With respect to
          these
          hedges, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value
          of
          the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates
          used
          to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward
          rates
          would result in a $32.4 million decrease in the fair value of these hedges
          and
          would also increase our interest expense.

As
          of
          December 31, 2004, we also had outstanding cash flow hedges that effectively
          locked in the interest rate on a majority of certain anticipated debt
          transactions that ultimately were completed in February 2005. We locked
          in the
          interest rate on (i) $100 million of 2.25 year debt (remarketed in February
          2005) at 3.9%; (ii) $75 million of 10-year debt (issued in February 2005)
          at
          5.4%; and (iii) $225 million of 10-year debt (issued in February 2005)
          at 5.5%.
          In February 2005, upon settlement of such hedges, we (i) received $366,000
          related to the 2.25 year debt remarketing which is being amortized as a
          reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt and (ii)
          paid
          $7.7 million related to the 10-year debt issuance which is being amortized
          as an
          increase in interest expense over the 10-year term of the debt.

LIQUIDITY
          AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Excluding
          cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to provide
          for our cash needs. Our operations have historically provided a stable
          source of
          cash flow which has helped us continue our long-term program of capital
          improvements.

Operating
          activities.

Net cash
          provided by operating activities was $964.7 million, $955.8 million and
          $1.068
          billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our accompanying consolidated
          statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income
          and net
          cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. For additional
          information relating to our operations, see “Results of Operations”
above.

Investing
          activities.

Net cash
          used in investing activities was $481.4 million, $413.3 million and $464.6
          million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions
          was
          $75.5 million in 2005 (due to the acquisition of fiber assets in 16 metropolitan
          markets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.) and $86.2 million in 2003 (primarily
          due to the acquisitions of fiber transport assets and the acquisition of
          an
          additional 24.3% interest in a telephone company in which we now own a
          100%
          interest). Capital expenditures during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $414.9
          million,
          $385.3 million and $377.9 million, respectively.

Financing
          activities.

Net cash
          used in financing activities was $491.7 million in 2005, $578.5 million
          in 2004
          and $403.8 million in 2003. Payments of debt were $693.3 million in 2005
          and
          $179.4 million in 2004. In accordance with previously announced stock repurchase
          programs, we repurchased 16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million) and 13.4
          million shares (for $401.0 million) in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
          repurchases include 12.9 million shares repurchased (for a total price
          of $437.5
          million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements (see below and Note
          8 to
          the accompanying financial statements for additional information).

In
          February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of
          outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 at an interest rate of 4.628%.
          We
          received no proceeds in connection with the remarketing as all proceeds
          were
          held in trust to secure the obligation of our equity unit holders to purchase
          common stock from us on May 16, 2005. In connection with the remarketing,
          we
          purchased and retired approximately $400 million of the notes, resulting
          in
          approximately $100 million remaining outstanding. We incurred a pre-tax
          charge
          of approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing
          and retiring the notes. Proceeds to purchase such notes came from the February
          2005 issuance of $350 million of 5% senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and
          cash on
          hand.

On
          May
          16, 2005, upon settlement of 15.9 million of our outstanding equity units,
          we
          received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and issued approximately
          12.9
          million common shares. In late May 2005, we entered into accelerated share
          repurchase agreements with investment banks whereby we repurchased and
          retired
          12.9 million shares of common stock for an initial aggregate price of $416.5
          million, the proceeds of which came from the settlement of the equity units
          mentioned above and cash on hand. Under these agreements, the investment
          banks
          repurchased CenturyTel shares in the open market through December 2005.
          At the
          end of the repurchase period, we paid the investment banks a price adjustment
          in
          cash of approximately $21.0 million based principally upon the actual cost
          of
          the shares repurchased by the investment banks.

Other.

For
          2006, we have budgeted $325 million for capital expenditures. We have invested
          significant amounts in our wireline network in the last several years and
          believe we are in a position to move closer to maintenance capital expenditure
          levels for the foreseeable future for our wireline operations. Our capital
          expenditure budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service
          offerings
          and expanding our data networks.

As
          relief
          from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, certain of our affected subsidiaries
          were
          granted a deferral from making their remaining 2005 estimated federal tax
          payments until 2006. Accordingly, we made a payment of approximately $75
          million
          in the first quarter of 2006 to satisfy our remaining 2005 estimated
          payments.

We
          expect
          to receive approximately $120 million of cash on a pre-tax basis in the
          first
          half of 2006 from the redemption of our Rural Telephone Bank stock.

On
          February 21, 2006, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program
          authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock and
          terminated the approximately $13 million remaining balance of our existing
          $200
          million share repurchase program approved in February 2005. We repurchased
          the
          first $500 million of common stock through accelerated share repurchase
          agreements entered into with various investment banks, repurchasing and
          retiring
          approximately 14.36 million shares of common stock at an average initial
          price
          of $34.83 per share. We funded these agreements principally through borrowings
          under our $750 million credit facility and cash on hand. We expect to use
          cash
          generated from operations during 2006 to repay these borrowings. The investment
          banks are expected to repurchase an equivalent number of shares in the
          open
          market in the coming months. Once these repurchases are complete, we will
          receive or be required to pay a price adjustment (payable at our discretion
          in
          either shares or cash) based principally on the actual cost of the shares
          repurchased by the investment banks.

The
          following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual
          obligations as of December 31, 2005.

(1)
          For
          additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments,
          see
          Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
          annual report.

(2)
          Includes $165 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures,
          Series K, due 2032, which can be put to us at various dates beginning in
          2006.

We
          continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications
          operations and expect to continue our long-term strategy of pursuing the
          acquisition of attractively-priced communications properties in exchange
          for
          cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions
          or
          negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce
          our
          acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or
          definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection
          with any
          such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact
          on our
          financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of
          our
          common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available
          for
          future issuance in connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf
          registration statement.

During
          2005, we secured a new five-year, $750 million revolving credit facility.
          Up to
          $150 million of the facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces
          the amount available for other extensions of credit. The credit facility
          contains financial covenants that require us to meet a consolidated leverage
          ratio (as defined in the facility) not exceeding 4 to 1 and a minimum interest
          coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.5 to 1. The interest
          rate on revolving loans under the facility is based on our choice of several
          prevailing commercial lending rates plus an additional margin that varies
          depending on our credit ratings and aggregate borrowings under the facility.
          We
          must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the facility,
          the amount of which varies based on our credit ratings. As of December
          31, 2005,
          we had no amounts outstanding under our new credit facility.

As
          of
          December 31, 2005, our telephone subsidiaries also had available for use
          $115.9
          million of commitments for long-term financing from the Rural Utilities
          Service.
          We have a commercial paper program that authorizes us to have outstanding
          up to
          $1.5 billion in commercial paper at any one time; however, borrowings are
          effectively limited to the amount available under our credit facility.
          As of
          December 31, 2005, we had no commercial paper outstanding under such program.
          We
          also have access to debt and equity capital markets, including our shelf
          registration statements. At December 31, 2005, we held over $158.8 million
          of
          cash and cash equivalents.

Moody’s
          Investors Service (“Moody’s”) rates our long-term debt Baa2 (with a stable
          outlook) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) rates our long-term debt BBB+
          (subject to being on CreditWatch with negative implications). Moody’s affirmed
          its rating in early 2006 in connection with the announcement of our $1.0
          billion
          stock repurchase program. In January 2006, S&P placed our debt rating on
          CreditWatch with negative implications, citing the continued loss of access
          lines in the wireline industry as a whole. Our commercial paper program
          is rated
          P2 by Moody’s and A2 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will
          increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our $750 million
          revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict our access to
          the
          capital markets, accelerate the conversion rights of holders of our outstanding
          convertible securities, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement
          debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings
          by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and
          decreasing our financial or operating flexibility.

The
          following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and
          ratio
          of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for
          the
          years ended December 31:

REGULATION
          AND COMPETITION

The
          communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory,
          legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have
          a
          significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications
          companies.

Events
          affecting the communications industry.

Wireless
          telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition
          with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete
          effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services.
          As a
          result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional
          wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service. We
          anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless service providers
          continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates, improve the
          quality
          of their services, and offer enhanced new services.

In
          1996,
          the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the
“1996
          Act”), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their
          facilities to the LEC’s network and to take various other steps that are
          designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Act’s rural telephone company
          exemption, approximately 50% of our telephone access lines are exempt from
          certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate
          state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a
          competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria.

Prior
          to
          and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state
          legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local
          exchange
          competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition
          has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative
          changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the
          continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with
          LECs’
services.

As
          mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal
          service support mechanism for rural telephone companies by adopting an
          interim
          mechanism for a five-year period, which ends June 30, 2006, based on embedded,
          or historical, costs that will provide predictable levels of support to
          rural
          local exchange carriers, including substantially all of our LECs. Wireless
          and
          other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications
          carrier (“ETC”) status in order to be eligible to receive USF support, which,
          coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed
          stresses on the USF’s funding mechanism. These developments have placed
          additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary
          and
          available to provide support to all eligible service providers, including
          support payments we receive from the High Cost Loop support program. As
          a result
          of the continued increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor
          used
          by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients (caused by a decrease
          in the
          size of the High Cost Loop support program and changes in requests for
          support
          from the USF), we believe the aggregate level of payments we receive from
          the
          USF will continue to decline in the near term under the FCC’s current rules.
          Based on recent FCC filings, we anticipate our 2006 revenues from the USF
          High
          Cost Loop support program will be approximately $8-12 million lower than
          levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor.

On
          August
          16, 2004, the FSJB released a notice requesting comments on the FCC’s current
          rules for the provision of high-cost support for rural companies, including
          comments on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner
          that
          would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us. In addition, the FCC
          has
          taken various other steps in anticipation of restructuring universal service
          support mechanisms and various parties have judicially challenged several
          aspects of the FCC’s universal service rules, all of which has created
          additional uncertainty regarding the USF’s programs, including opening a docket
          that will change the method of funding contributions. The FCC is expected
          to
          issue soon an order addressing a new type of contribution methodology.
          In the
          event that does not happen, we believe, but cannot assure you, that the
          FCC will
          likely extend the interim mechanism now in place before it lapses on June
          30,
          2006.

Technological
          developments have led to the development of new services that compete with
          traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable
          television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone
          service
          over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have
          aggressively pursued this opportunity. Recently several large electric
          utilities
          have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with
          LECs.
          Recent improvements in the quality of "Voice-over-Internet Protocol" ("VoIP")
          service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications
          companies, as well as start-up companies, to substantially increase their
          offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers
          use existing broadband networks to deliver flat-rate, all distance calling
          plans
          that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional
          LECs and
          may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long
          distance telephone services. Beginning in late 2003, the FCC initiated
          rulemaking proceedings to address the regulation of VoIP, and has adopted
          orders
          establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines. There can be no
          assurance
          that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP
          providers will not successfully compete for our customers.

In
          2003,
          the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate
          goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications
          industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying
          or
          delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier
          compensation proposals from several industry groups, and in early 2005
          solicited
          comments on all proposals previously submitted to it. Industry negotiations
          are
          continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses
          the
          concerns of carriers from all industry segments. Until this proceeding
          concludes
          and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot
          estimate the impact this proceeding will have on our results of
          operations.

Many
          cable, entertainment, technology or other communication companies that
          previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering
          diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies
          are
          competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer
          base.

Recent
          events affecting us.

During
          the last few years, several states in which we have substantial operations
          took
          legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the
          LEC
          business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to
          provide
          local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent years,
          especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it
          is
          anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the
          future.

State
          alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of our LECs have
          also
          affected revenue growth recently. These alternative regulation plans now
          govern
          over 60% of our access lines.

Certain
          long distance carriers continue to request that we reduce intrastate access
          tariffed rates for certain of its LECs. In addition, we have recently
          experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement
          of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services.
          In
          2005 we incurred a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately
          $13.4
          million compared to 2004 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding
          decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was $26.8 million. We believe this trend
          of
          decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2006, although the magnitude
          of
          such decrease is uncertain.

While
          we
          expect our operating revenues in 2006 to continue to experience downward
          pressure primarily due to continued access line losses and reduced network
          access revenues, we expect such declines to be partially offset primarily
          due to
          increased demand for our fiber transport, DSL and other nonregulated product
          offerings (including our new video and wireless initiatives).

For
          a
          more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations
          and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual
          report.

Other
          matters.

Our
          regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from
          Verizon
          in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
          Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
(“SFAS 71”). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the
          recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and
          impose a
          liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities
          are
          required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet
          of an
          entity subject to SFAS 71. We are monitoring the ongoing applicability
          of SFAS
          71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory,
          competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes
          in
          regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services
          or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being subject
          to
          SFAS 71 in the near future.

Statement
          of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, “Regulated Enterprises - Accounting
          for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71” (“SFAS 101”),
          specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the
          criteria
          for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects
          of
          any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities
          in
          accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and
          liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. Depreciation rates of certain
          assets
          established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject
          to
          SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess
          of
          the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS
          143,
          SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for
          removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal
          obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions
          of
          SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. SFAS 101 further
          provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are
          to be
          adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment
          shall be
          judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises.

Our
          consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 included regulatory
          assets of
          approximately $3.1 million (primarily deferred costs related to financing
          costs
          and regulatory proceedings) and regulatory liabilities of approximately
          $183.2
          million related to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation
          (as described above). Net deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory
          assets and liabilities quantified above were $68.3 million.

When
          and
          if our regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS
          71, we
          currently do not expect to record any impairment charge related to the
          carrying
          value of the property, plant and equipment of our regulated telephone
          operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we would
          be
          required to revise the lives of our property, plant and equipment to reflect
          the
          estimated useful lives of the assets. We currently do not expect such revisions
          in asset lives will have a material impact on our results of operations.
          For
          regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of our telephone subsidiaries
          will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71.

We
          have
          certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to
          the
          protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2005 have not
          been
          material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become
          material.

Management
          has prepared and is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of our
          consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements
          have
          been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
          in the
          United States of America and necessarily include amounts determined using
          our
          best judgments and estimates.

Our
          consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent
          registered public accounting firm, who have expressed their opinion with
          respect
          to the fairness of the consolidated financial statements. Their audit was
          conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting
          Oversight Board (United States).

Management
          is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls
          over
          financial reporting, a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
          regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
          financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
          accepted

          of
          management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
          officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
          control
          over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
          Control - Integrated Framework

issued
          by
          the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
          Based on our evaluation under the framework of COSO

,

management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
          was
          effective as of December 31, 2005. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness
          of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005

          been audited by KPMG LLP, as stated in their report which is included herein.

          of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
          may not
          prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
          effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
          become
          inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
          with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The
          Audit
          Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of independent directors
          who are
          not officers or employees. The Committee meets periodically with the external
          auditors, internal auditors and management. The Committee considers the
          independence of the external auditors and the audit scope and discusses
          internal
          control, financial and reporting matters. Both the external and internal
          auditors have free access to the Committee.

Report
          of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
          Board
          of Directors and Stockholders

CenturyTel,
          Inc.:

We
          have
          audited the consolidated financial statements of CenturyTel, Inc. and
          subsidiaries as listed in Item 15a(1). In connection with our audits of
          the
          consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
          schedule as listed in Item 15a(2). These consolidated financial statements
          and
          financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
          Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
          statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
          conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
          Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
          we plan
          and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
          financial
          statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
          on a
          test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
          statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
          used and
          significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
          financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
          reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
          our
          opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
          fairly,
          in all material respects, the financial position of CenturyTel, Inc. and
          subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
          operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
          period
          ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
          principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
          when
          considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
          as a
          whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
          therein.

We
          also
          have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
          Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
          control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
          established in

          by
          the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

          report dated March 13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s

Report
          of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
          Board
          of Directors and Stockholders

CenturyTel,
          Inc.:

We
          have
          audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Report
          of Management,

that
          CenturyTel, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
          as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
          by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
          (COSO)

.

The
          Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
          over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
          internal
          control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
          on
          management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
          internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
          conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
          Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
          we plan
          and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
          internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
          respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
          over
          financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
          the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
          such
          other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
          that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
          company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
          provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
          and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
          with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
          financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
          to
          the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
          reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
          (2)
          provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
          to
          permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
          accepted
          accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
          are
          being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
          of
          the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
          or timely
          detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
          assets that could have a material effect on the financial
          statements.

Because
          of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
          may not
          prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
          effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
          become
          inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
          with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
          our
          opinion, management’s assessment that CenturyTel, Inc. maintained effective
          internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
          stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
          by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
          (COSO)

.

Also,
          in
          our opinion, CenturyTel, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
          internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based
          on
          criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
          by
          the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
          (COSO).

We
          also
          have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
          Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements
          of
          CenturyTel, Inc. and subsidiaries and related financial statement schedule
          as
          listed in Items 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2), respectively, and our report dated
          March 13, 2006

expressed
          an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and related
          financial statement schedule.

SUMMARY
                      OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
            of consolidation

- Our
            consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyTel,
            Inc. and
            its majority-owned subsidiaries.

Regulatory
            accounting

- Our
            regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from
            Verizon
            in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
(“SFAS 71”). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the
            recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and
            impose a
            liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities
            are
            required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet
            of an
            entity subject to SFAS 71. We are monitoring the ongoing applicability
            of SFAS
            71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory,
            competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes
            in
            regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated
            services
            or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being
            subject to
            SFAS 71 in the near future. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December
            31,
            2005 included regulatory assets of approximately $3.1 million (consisting
            primarily of deferred costs related to financing costs and regulatory
            proceedings) and regulatory liabilities of approximately $183.2 million
            related
            to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation (as required
            to
            be recorded by regulators). Net deferred income tax assets related to
            the
            regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $68.3
            million.

Estimates

-
            The
            preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
            accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
            that
            affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
            of
            contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
            and
            the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
            Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Revenue
            recognition

-
            Revenues are generally recognized when services are provided or when
            products
            are delivered to customers. Revenue that is billed in advance includes
            monthly
            recurring network access services, special access services and monthly
            recurring
            local line charges. The unearned portion of this revenue is initially
            deferred
            as a component of advanced billings and customer deposits on our balance
            sheet
            and recognized as revenue over the period that the services are provided.
            Revenue that is billed in arrears includes nonrecurring network access
            services,
            nonrecurring local services and long distance services. The earned but
            unbilled
            portion of this revenue is recognized as revenue in the period that the
            services
            are provided.

Certain
            of our telephone subsidiaries’ revenues are based on tariffed access charges
            filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission; the remainder
            of our
            telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with
            other
            telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate
            revenue.
            Such sharing arrangements are funded by toll revenue and/or access charges
            within state jurisdictions and by access charges in the interstate market.
            Revenues earned through the various sharing arrangements are initially
            recorded
            based on our estimates.

Allowance
            for doubtful accounts

.
            In
            evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a
            number of
            factors, including a specific customer’s or carrier’s ability to meet its
            financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been
            past due
            and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we
            record both
            specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to
            reduce
            the stated amount of applicable accounts receivable to the amount we
            ultimately
            expect to collect.

Property,
            plant and equipment

-
            Telephone plant is stated at original cost. Normal retirements of telephone
            plant are charged against accumulated depreciation, along with the costs
            of
            removal, less salvage, with no gain or loss recognized. Renewals and
            betterments
            of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals
            of
            minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of telephone
            plant
            is provided on the straight line method using class or overall group
            rates
            acceptable to regulatory authorities; such average rates range from 2%
            to
            20%.

Non-telephone
            property is stated at cost and, when sold or retired, a gain or loss
            is
            recognized. Depreciation of such property is provided on the straight
            line
            method over estimated service lives ranging from two to 35 years.

Intangible
            assets

-
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
            Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), requires goodwill recorded in a business
            combination to be reviewed for impairment and to be written down only
            in periods
            in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Impairment
            of
            goodwill is tested at least annually by comparing the fair value of the
            reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates
            of the fair
            value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using criterion
            such
            as multiples of earnings.

Long-lived
            assets

-
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
            Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”), addresses financial
            accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
            assets
            (exclusive of goodwill) and also broadens the reporting of discontinued
            operations to include all components of an entity with operations that
            can be
            distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated
            from the
            ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction.

Affiliated
            transactions

-
            Certain of our service subsidiaries provide installation and maintenance
            services, materials and supplies, and managerial, operational, technical,
            accounting and administrative services to subsidiaries. In addition,
            CenturyTel
            provides and bills management services to subsidiaries and in certain
            instances
            makes interest bearing advances to finance construction of plant and
            purchases
            of equipment. These transactions are recorded by our telephone subsidiaries
            at
            their cost to the extent permitted by regulatory authorities. Intercompany
            profit on transactions with regulated affiliates is limited to a reasonable
            return on investment and has not been eliminated in connection with
            consolidating the results of operations of CenturyTel and its subsidiaries.
            Intercompany profit on transactions with affiliates not subject to SFAS
            71 has
            been eliminated.

Income
            taxes

- We
            file a consolidated federal income tax return with our eligible subsidiaries.
            We
            use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under
            which
            deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the future tax
            consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
            carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.

Derivative
            financial instruments

- We
            account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance
            with
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
            Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), as amended. SFAS 133, as
            amended, requires that all derivative instruments, such as interest rate
            swaps,
            be recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value
            regardless
            of the purpose or intent of holding them. On the date a derivative contract
            is
            entered into, we designate the derivative as either a fair value or cash
            flow
            hedge. A hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or
            of an
            unrecognized firm commitment is a fair value hedge. A hedge of a forecasted
            transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related
            to a
            recognized asset or liability is a cash flow hedge. We also formally
            assess,
            both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
            that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
            changes
            in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If we determine that a
            derivative
            is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly
            effective hedge, we would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.
            We
            recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes
            in
            the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized
            in
            income or stockholders’ equity (as a component of other comprehensive income),
            depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in
            the fair
            value or cash flows. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
            for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews
            our
            exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage
            the
            exposure.

Earnings
            per share

- Basic
            earnings per share amounts are determined on the basis of the weighted
            average
            number of common shares outstanding during the applicable accounting
            period.
            Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potential dilutive common
            shares
            that were outstanding during the period. In the fourth quarter of 2004,
            we
            adopted the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force No. 04-8, “The Effect of
            Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” in
            calculating our diluted earnings per share. See Note 12 for additional
            information.

Stock-based
            compensation

- Over
            the past several years, we accounted for stock compensation plans using
            the
            intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
            Opinion
            No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” as allowed by Statement of
            Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
            Compensation” (“SFAS 123”). Options have been granted at a price either equal to
            or exceeding the then-current market price. Accordingly, we have not
            to date
            recognized compensation cost in connection with issuing stock options.

During
            2005 we granted 1,015,025 options at market price. The weighted average
            fair
            value of each of the 2005 options was estimated as of the date of grant
            to be
            $12.68 using an option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
            dividend
            yield - .7%; expected volatility - 30%; weighted average risk-free interest
            rate
            - 4.2%; and expected option life - seven years.

During
            2004 we granted 952,975 options at market price. The weighted average
            fair value
            of each of the 2004 options was estimated as of the date of grant to
            be $10.25
            using an option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend
            yield -
            .7%; expected volatility - 30%; weighted average risk-free interest rate
            - 3.6%;
            and expected option life - seven years.

During
            2003 we granted 1,720,317 options at market price. The weighted average
            fair
            value of each of the 2003 options was estimated as of the date of grant
            to be
            $9.94 using an option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend
            yield - .7%; expected volatility - 30%; weighted average risk-free interest
            rate
            - 3.4%; and expected option life - seven years.

If
            compensation cost for our options had been determined consistent with
            SFAS 123,
            our net income and earnings per share on a pro forma basis for 2005,
            2004 and
            2003 would have been as follows:

Beginning
            in the first quarter of 2006, we will adopt the provisions of Statement
            of
            Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payments”
(“SFAS 123(R)”). SFAS 123(R) requires us to measure the cost of the employee
            services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based
            upon the
            fair value of the award on the grant date. Such cost will be recognized
            as an
            expense over the period during which the employee is required to provide
            service
            in exchange for the award. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), compensation
            cost is
            also recognized over the applicable remaining vesting period for any
            outstanding
            awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date. On December
            14, 2005,
            the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved accelerating
            the
            vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding (which totaled approximately
            1.5 million options) under our management incentive compensation plans,
            effective as of December 31, 2005. The Committee accelerated the vesting
            period
            to eliminate the recognition of compensation expense which would otherwise
            have
            been required by SFAS 123(R). The aggregate pre-tax compensation expense
            that we
            will avoid is approximately $4.9 million, of which approximately $4.1
            million
            would have been recognized in 2006. The table above includes this $4.9
            million
            amount as a pro forma compensation expense for 2005. We recognized approximately
            $156,000 of expense ($96,000 net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2005
            upon
            accelerating the vesting of all options outstanding.

Cash
            equivalents

- We
            consider short-term investments with a maturity at date of purchase of
            three
            months or less to be cash equivalents.

ACQUISITIONS

On
            June
            30, 2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC
            Telecom
            Holdings, Inc. (“KMC”) for approximately $75.5 million. The assets acquired and
            liabilities assumed have been reflected in our consolidated balance sheet
            based
            on a purchase price allocation determined by independent third parties.
            The vast
            majority of the purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment.
            See Note 3 for information concerning amounts allocated to certain intangible
            assets as a result of the KMC acquisition.

In
            June
            and December 2003, we acquired certain fiber transport assets for an
            aggregate
            of $55.2 million cash (of which $3.8 million was paid as a deposit in
            2002). In
            the fourth quarter of 2003, we purchased an additional 24.3% interest
            in a
            telephone company in which we owned a majority interest for $32.4 million
            cash.

The
            results of operations of the acquired properties are included in our
            results of
            operations from and after the respective acquisition dates.

As
            of
            September 30, 2005, we completed the required annual impairment test
            under SFAS
            142 and determined our goodwill was not impaired.

We
            recently implemented a new integrated billing and customer care system.
            We
            accounted for the costs to develop such system in accordance with Statement
            of
            Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
            Obtained for Internal Use.” Aggregate capitalized costs (before accumulated
            amortization) totaled $207.0 million and is being amortized over a twenty-year
            period.

In
            the
            third quarter of 2004, we entered into a three-year agreement with EchoStar
            Communications Corporation (“EchoStar”) to provide co-branded satellite
            television services to our customers. As part of the transaction, we
            invested
            $25 million in an EchoStar convertible subordinated debt security, which
            had a
            fair value at date of issuance of approximately $20.8 million and matures
            in
            2011. The remaining $4.2 million paid was established as an intangible
            asset
            attributable to our contractual right to provide video service and is
            being
            amortized over a three-year period.

In
            connection with the acquisitions of properties from Verizon Communications,
            Inc.
            (“Verizon”) in 2002, we assigned $35.3 million of the purchase price as an
            intangible asset associated with franchise costs (which includes amounts
            necessary to maintain eligibility to provide telecommunications services
            in its
            licensed service areas). In 2005, we assigned $1.4 million of the purchase
            price
            of our acquisition of KMC fiber assets as an intangible asset. Such assets
            have
            an indefinite life and therefore are not subject to amortization currently.

We
            assigned $22.7 million of the purchase price to a customer base intangible
            asset
            in connection with the acquisitions of Verizon properties in 2002. In
            2005, $2.4
            million of the purchase price of our acquisition of KMC fiber assets
            was
            assigned to a customer base intangible asset. Such assets are being amortized
            over 15 years. In addition, as mentioned above, in 2004 we established
            an
            intangible asset related to the contractual rights to provide video service.
            Total amortization expense for these customer base and contractual right
            intangible assets for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $3.0 million, $2.0 million
            and
            $1.5 million, respectively, and is expected to be $3.1 million in 2006,
            $2.6
            million in 2007, and $1.7 million annually thereafter through 2010.

LONG-TERM
                      DEBT

Our
            long-term debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

*
            Weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2005

The
            approximate annual debt maturities for the five years subsequent to December
            31,
            2005 are as follows: 2006 - $276.7 million (including $165 million aggregate
            principal amount of our convertible debentures, Series K, due 2032, which
            can be
            put to us at various dates beginning in 2006); 2007 - $121.1 million;
            2008 -
            $280.6 million; 2009 - $15.6 million; and 2010 - $514.3 million.

Certain
            of our loan agreements contain various restrictions, among which are
            limitations
            regarding issuance of additional debt, payment of cash dividends, reacquisition
            of capital stock and other matters. In addition, the transfer of funds
            from
            certain consolidated subsidiaries to CenturyTel is restricted by various
            loan
            agreements. Subsidiaries which have loans from government agencies and
            cooperative lending associations, or have issued first mortgage bonds,
            generally
            may not loan or advance any funds to CenturyTel, but may pay dividends
            if
            certain financial ratios are met. At December 31, 2005, restricted net
            assets of
            subsidiaries were $160.6 million and subsidiaries’ retained earnings in excess
            of amounts restricted by debt covenants totaled $1.9 billion. At December
            31,
            2005, approximately $2.6 billion of our consolidated retained earnings
            reflected
            on the balance sheet was available under our loan agreements for the
            declaration
            of dividends.

The
            senior notes and debentures of CenturyTel referred to above were issued
            under an
            indenture dated March 31, 1994. This indenture does not contain any financial
            covenants, but does include restrictions that limit our ability to (i)
            incur,
            issue or create liens upon its property and (ii) consolidate with or
            merge into,
            or transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to, any other
            party.
            The indenture does not contain any provisions that are tied to our credit
            ratings, or that restrict the issuance of new securities in the event
            of a
            material adverse change to us.

Approximately
            16% of our property, plant and equipment is pledged to secure the long-term
            debt
            of subsidiaries.

In
            May
            2004, we prepaid all $100 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25%,
            Series B notes, due 2024. We incurred a $4.6 million pre-tax expense
            (a $3.6
            million prepayment premium and a $1.0 million write-off of unamortized
            deferred
            debt costs) in the second quarter of 2004 associated with this
            prepayment.

In
            May
            2002, we

issued
            and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of equity units,
            each
            of which were priced at $25 and consisted initially of a beneficial interest
            in
            a CenturyTel senior unsecured note (Series J, due 2007 and remarketable
            in 2005)
            with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase shares of CenturyTel
            common stock no later than May 2005. Each purchase contract generally
            required
            the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a share of CenturyTel
            common
            stock on May 16, 2005 in exchange for $25, subject to certain adjustments
            and
            exceptions.

In
            February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of
            outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 (the notes described above),
            at an
            interest rate of 4.628%. We received no proceeds in connection with the
            remarketing as all net proceeds were held in trust to secure the equity
            unit
            holders’ obligation to purchase common stock from us on May 16, 2005. In
            connection with the remarketing, we purchased and retired approximately
            $400
            million of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million remaining
            outstanding. We incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $6.0 million
            in the
            first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing and retiring the notes. Proceeds
            to
            purchase such notes came from the February 2005 issuance of $350 million
            of 5%
            senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and cash on hand.

Between April 15, 2005 and May 4, 2005, we repurchased and cancelled
            an
            aggregate of approximately 4.1 million of our equity units in
            privately-negotiated transactions with six institutional holders at an
            average
            price of $25.18 per unit. The remaining 15.9 million equity units outstanding
            on
            May 16, 2005 were settled in stock in accordance with the terms and conditions
            of the purchase contract that formed a part of such unit.

Accordingly,
            on May 16, 2005, we received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million
            and issued
            approximately 12.9 million common shares in the aggregate. See Note 8
            for
            information on our accelerated share repurchase program which mitigated
            the
            dilutive impact of issuing these 12.9 million shares.

As
            of
            December 31, 2005, we had available a $750 million five-year revolving
            credit
            facility. We had no outstanding borrowings under our facility at December
            31,
            2005. At December 31, 2005, our telephone subsidiaries had available
            for use
            $115.9 million of commitments for long-term financing from the Rural
            Utilities
            Service.

In
            the
            third quarter of 2002, we issued $165 million of convertible senior debentures,
            Series K, due 2032 (which bear interest at 4.75% and which may be converted
            under certain specified circumstances into shares of CenturyTel common
            stock at
            a conversion price of $40.455 per share). Holders of the convertible
            senior
            debentures will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion
            of the
            debentures on August 1, 2006, August 1, 2010 and August 1, 2017. In each
            case,
            the purchase price payable will be equal to 100% of the principal amount
            of the
            debentures to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the
            purchase
            date. We will pay cash for all debentures so purchased on August 1, 2006.
            For
            any such purchases on or after August 1, 2010, we may choose to pay the
            purchase
            price in cash or shares of our common stock, or any combination thereof
            (except
            that we will pay any accrued and unpaid interest in cash).

DERIVATIVE
                      INSTRUMENTS

In
            2003,
            we entered into four separate fair value interest rate hedges associated
            with
            the full $500 million principal amount of our Series L senior notes,
            due 2012,
            that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These hedges are “fixed to
            variable” interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixed rate interest
            payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable
            rates
            that range from the six-month London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus
            3.229% to the six-month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset
            dates
            occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August
            2012.
            As of December 31, 2005, we realized a weighted average interest rate
            of 8.25%
            related to these hedges. Interest expense was reduced by $386,000 during
            2005 as
            a result of these hedges. The aggregate fair value of such hedges at
            December
            31, 2005 was $17.6 million and is reflected on the accompanying balance
            sheet as
            both a liability (included in “Deferred credits and other liabilities”) and as a
            decrease to our underlying long-term debt.

In
            late
            2004 and early 2005, we entered into several cash flow hedges that effectively
            locked in the interest rate on a majority of certain anticipated debt
            transactions that we ultimately completed in February 2005. We locked
            in the
            interest rate on (i) $100 million of 2.25-year debt (remarketed in February
            2005) at 3.9%; (ii) $75 million of 10-year debt (issued in February 2005)
            at
            5.4%; and (iii) $225 million of 10-year debt (issued in February 2005)
            at 5.5%.
            In February 2005, upon settlement of such hedges, we (i) received $366,000
            related to the 2.25-year debt remarketing, which is being amortized as
            a
            reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt, and
            (ii) paid
            $7.7 million related to the 10-year debt issuance, which is being amortized
            as
            an increase in interest expense over the 10-year term of the debt.

In
            accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased
            16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million) and 13.4 million shares (for
            $401.0
            million) in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 repurchases included
            12.9
            million shares repurchased (for an initial price of $416.5 million) under
            accelerated share repurchase agreements (see below for additional
            information).

In
            late
            May 2005, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with
            three
            investment banks whereby we repurchased and retired approximately 12.9
            million
            shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $416.5 million cash (or
            an
            initial average price of $32.34 per share). We funded this purchase using
            the
            proceeds received from the settlement of the equity units mentioned in
            Note 5
            and from cash on hand. As part of the accelerated share repurchase transactions,
            we simultaneously entered into forward contracts with the investment
            banks
            whereby the investment banks purchased an aggregate of 12.9 million shares
            of
            our common stock during the term of the contracts. At the end of the
            repurchase
            period, we paid an aggregate of approximately $21.0 million cash to the
            investment banks since the investment banks’ weighted average purchase price
            during the repurchase period was higher than the initial average price.
            We
            reflected such settlement amount as an adjustment to equity.

See
            Note
            18 for information concerning a $1.0 billion share repurchase program
            approved
            by our board of directors in February 2006.

Under
            CenturyTel’s Articles of Incorporation each share of common stock beneficially
            owned continuously by the same person since May 30, 1987 generally entitles
            the
            holder thereof to ten votes per share. All other shares entitle the holder
            to
            one vote per share. At December 31, 2005, the holders of 7.7 million
            shares of
            common stock were entitled to ten votes per share.

Preferred
            stock

- As of
            December 31, 2005, we had 2.0 million shares of authorized preferred
            stock, $25
            par value per share. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were 314,000
            and
            319,000 shares, respectively, of outstanding convertible preferred stock.
            Holders of outstanding CenturyTel preferred stock are entitled to receive
            cumulative dividends, receive preferential distributions equal to $25
            per share
            plus unpaid dividends upon CenturyTel’s liquidation and vote as a single class
            with the holders of common stock.

Shareholders’
            Rights Plan

- In
            1996 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preference share
            purchase
            right for each common share outstanding. Such rights become exercisable
            if and
            when a potential acquiror takes certain steps to acquire 15% or more
            of
            CenturyTel’s common stock. Upon the occurrence of such an acquisition, each
            right held by shareholders other than the acquiror may be exercised to
            receive
            that number of shares of common stock or other securities of CenturyTel
            (or, in
            certain situations, the acquiring company) which at the time of such
            transaction
            will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.
            Such plan
            expires in November 2006 and will be reconsidered for renewal by our
            Board of
            Directors.

POSTRETIREMENT
                      BENEFITS

We
            sponsor health care plans (which use a December 31 measurement date)
            that
            provide postretirement benefits to all qualified retired employees.

In
            May
            2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Statement
            Position FAS 106-2, which provides accounting guidance to sponsors of
            postretirement health care plans that are impacted by the Medicare Prescription
            Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”). We believe that
            certain drug benefits offered under our postretirement health care plans
            will
            qualify for subsidy under Medicare Part D. In the third quarter of 2004,
            we
            estimated that the effect of the Act on us would not be material. We
            first
            reflected the effects of the Act as of the December 31, 2004 measurement
            date.
            As of this date, we estimated that the reduction in our accumulated benefit
            obligation attributable to prior service cost was approximately $7 million
            and
            reflected such amount as an actuarial gain.

In
            2005,
            in connection with negotiating certain union contracts, we amended certain
            retiree contribution and retirement eligibility provisions of our plan.
            In 2003,
            we announced changes, effective January 1, 2004, that (i) decreased our
            subsidization of benefits provided under our postretirement benefit plan
            for
            existing participants and (ii) eliminated our subsidization of benefits
            for
            employees hired after January 1, 2003.

The
            following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for
            the
            benefit obligation and the plan assets.

We
            employ
            a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed
            income
            investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets
            for a
            prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan
            expenses
            by outperforming plan liabilities over the long term. Risk tolerance
            is
            established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded
            status and corporate financial condition. We measure and monitor investment
            risk
            on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset
            studies and periodic portfolio reviews.

Our
            postretirement benefit plan weighted-average asset allocations at December
            31,

In
            determining the expected return on plan assets, we study historical markets
            and
            apply the widely-accepted capital market principle that assets with higher
            volatility and risk generate a greater return over the long term. We
            evaluate
            current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before determining
            long-term capital market assumptions. We also review peer data and historical
            returns to check for reasonableness.

Assumed
            health care cost trends have a significant effect on the amounts reported
            for
            postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed
            health

At

            benefit
            obligations of $437.8 million and $172.0 million, respectively, and aggregate

We
            employ
            a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed
            income
            investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets
            for a
            prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan
            expenses
            by outperforming plan liabilities over the long term. Risk tolerance
            is
            established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded
            status and corporate financial condition. We measure and monitor investment
            risk
            on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset
            studies and periodic portfolio reviews.

Our
            pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2005
            and 2004
            by asset category are as follows:

In
            determining the expected return on plan assets, we study historical markets
            and
            apply the widely-accepted capital market principle that assets with higher
            volatility and risk generate a greater return over the long term. We
            evaluate
            current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before determining
            long-term capital market assumptions. We also review peer data and historical
            returns to check for reasonableness.

The
            amount of the 2006 contribution will be determined based on a number
            of factors,
            including the results of the 2006 actuarial valuation report. At this
            time, the
            amount of the 2006 contribution is not known.

Our
            estimated future projected benefit payments under our defined benefit
            pension
            plans are as follows: 2006 - $22.8 million; 2007 - $24.1 million; 2008
            - $26.9
            million; 2009 - $29.0 million; 2010 - $31.2 million; and 2011-2015 -
            $190.8
            million.

We
            also
            sponsor an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) which covers most employees
            with one year of service and is funded by our contributions determined
            annually
            by the Board of Directors. Our expense related to the ESOP during 2005,
            2004 and
            2003 was $7.3 million, $8.1 million, and $8.9 million, respectively.
            At December
            31, 2005, the ESOP owned an aggregate of 6.0 million shares of CenturyTel
            common
            stock.

We
            also
            sponsor qualified profit sharing plans pursuant to Section 401(k) of
            the
            Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plans”) which are available to substantially
            all employees. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plans were $9.5
            million
            in 2005, $9.1 million in 2004 and $8.2 million in 2003.

We
            establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce the deferred
            tax assets
            to amounts we expect to realize. As of December 31, 2005, we had available
            tax
            benefits associated with net state operating loss carryforwards, which
            expire
            through 2025, of $56.5 million. The ultimate realization of the benefits
            of the
            carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
            during
            the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We
            consider
            our scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
            taxable
            income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result
            of
            such assessment, we reserved $54.4 million through the valuation allowance
            as of
            December 31, 2005 as it is more likely than not that this amount of net
            operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized prior to expiration.
            Income
            tax expense for 2005 was increased by $19.5 million as a result of increasing
            the valuation allowance related to net state operating loss carryforwards.
            This
            increase was primarily due to changes in state income tax laws and other
            factors
            which impacted the projections of future taxable income.

            included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. Our $165 million
            Series
            K senior notes (issued in the third quarter of 2002) are convertible
            into
            approximately 4.1 million shares of common stock under various contingent
            circumstances, including the common stock attaining a specified trading
            price in
            excess of the notes’ fixed conversion price. Beginning in the fourth quarter of
            2004, our diluted earnings per share and diluted shares outstanding reflect
            the
            application of EITF 04-8. Prior periods have been restated to reflect
            this
            change in accounting.

In
            connection with calculating our diluted earnings per share for our accelerated
            share repurchase program discussed in Note 8, we assumed the accelerated
            share
            repurchase market price adjustment would be settled through our issuance
            of
            additional shares of common stock, which was allowed (at our discretion)
            in the
            agreement. Accordingly, the estimated shares issuable based on the fair
            value of
            the forward contract was included in the weighted average shares outstanding
            for
            the computation of diluted earnings per share.

The
              following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of
              the basic

STOCK
                      OPTION PROGRAMS

We
            currently maintain programs which allow the Board of Directors, through
            the
            Compensation Committee, to grant incentives to certain employees and
            our outside
            directors in any one or a combination of several forms, including incentive
            and
            non-qualified stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock;
            and
            performance shares. As of December 31, 2005, we had reserved 11.0 million
            shares of common stock which may be issued in connection with incentive
            awards
            made in the future under our current incentive compensation
            programs.

Under
            our
            programs, options have been granted to employees and directors at a price
            either
            equal to or exceeding the then-current market price. All of the options
            expire
            ten years after the date of grant and the original vesting period ranged
            from
            immediate to three years. In December 2005, the Company approved accelerating
            the vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding, effective as of
            December
            31, 2005. See Note 1 - Stock-Based Compensation, for additional information.

FAIR
                      VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
            following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
            of
            certain of our financial instruments at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

(1)

Fair
                      value was estimated by discounting the scheduled payment streams
                      to
                      present value based upon rates currently available to us for
                      similar
                      debt.

(2)

Fair
                      value was estimated by us to approximate carrying value or
                      is based on
                      current market information (see below for further
                      information).

Included
            in Financial Assets is our investment in stock of the Rural Telephone
            Bank
            (“RTB”). The RTB is currently in the process of dissolving and is expected
            to
            reimburse the holders of RTB stock in cash at par value (including accumulated
            earned stock dividends). The carrying value of our investment in RTB
            stock ($5.1
            million) is reflected on the balance sheet on the cost basis and does
            not
            include the cumulative stock dividends earned. Upon dissolution of the
            RTB, we
            expect to receive approximately $120 million in cash in the first half
            of 2006.
            Such amount is included in the fair value disclosure in the above
            table.

We
            believe the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
            accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates the fair value due
            to the
            short maturity of these instruments and have not been reflected in the
            above
            table.

BUSINESS
                      SEGMENTS

We are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing
            an
            array of communications services to our customers, including local exchange,
            long distance, Internet access and broadband services. We strive to maintain
            our
            customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings
            to
            provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications
            services. Effective in the first quarter of 2004, as a result of our
            increased
            focus on integrated bundle offerings and the varied discount structures
            associated with such offerings, we determined that our results of operations
            would be more appropriately reported as a single reportable segment under
            the
            provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures
            about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” Therefore, the results
            of operations for 2005 and 2004 reflect the presentation of a single
            reportable
            segment. Results of operations for 2003 have been conformed to this presentation
            of a single reportable segment.

Our
            operating revenues for our products and services include the following
            components:

COMMITMENTS
                      AND CONTINGENCIES

Construction
            expenditures and investments in vehicles, buildings and equipment during
            are estimated to be $325 million. We generally do not enter into firm,
            committed
            contracts for such activities.

In

Barbrasue
                Beattie and James Sovis, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly
                situated, v. CenturyTel, Inc.

,
                filed
                on October 28, 2002, in the United States District Court for the
                Eastern
                District of Michigan (Case No. 02-10277), the plaintiffs allege that
                we unjustly
                and unreasonably billed customers for inside wire maintenance services,
                and seek
                unspecified money damages and injunctive relief under various legal
                theories on
                behalf of a purported class of over two million customers in our
                telephone
                markets. On March 10, 2006, the Court certified the class action
                status of the
                suit and issued a ruling that the billing descriptions we used for these
                services during an approximately 18-month period between October
                29, 2000 and
                May 2002 were legally insufficient. We plan to appeal this decision.
                The Court’s
                order does not specify the award of damages, the scope of which remains
                subject
                to significant fact finding. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate
                the
                amount or range of possible loss; however, we believe it to be significantly
                below the level of revenues billed for such services during the above
                period. We
                do not believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will
                have a material
                adverse effect on our financial position or results of
                operations.

The
            Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file
            access
            tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems
            those
            tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been “deemed lawful” in effect nullify an
            interexchange carrier’s ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the
            tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return
            prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate
            tariffs directly with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach.
            For those
            tariffs that have not yet been “deemed lawful,” we initially record as a
            liability our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return, and
            may
            thereafter recognize as revenues some or all of these amounts at the
            end of the
            applicable settlement period as our legal entitlement thereto becomes
            more
            certain. We recorded approximately $35.9 million as revenue in the third
            quarter
            of 2005 as the settlement period related to the 2001/2002 monitoring
            period
            lapsed on September 30, 2005. We do not expect to recognize any revenue
            in 2006
            associated with the expiration of a monitoring period as described herein.
            As of
            December 31, 2005, the amount of our earnings in excess of the authorized
            rate
            of return reflected as a liability on the balance sheet for the 2003/2004
            monitoring period aggregated approximately $31.5 million. The settlement
            period
            related to 2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on September 30, 2007.
            We will
            continue to monitor the legal status of any proceedings that could impact
            our
            entitlement to these funds.

From
            time
            to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business,
            including administrative hearings of state public utility commissions
            relating
            primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, occasional
            grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies and miscellaneous
            third
            party tort actions. The outcome of these other proceedings is not predictable.
            However, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other
            proceedings, after considering available insurance coverage, will have
            a
            material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
            or cash
            flows.

SUBSEQUENT
                      EVENTS

On February 21, 2006, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase
            program
            authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock and
            terminated the approximately $13 million remaining balance of our existing
            $200
            million share repurchase program approved in February 2005. We repurchased
            the
            first $500 million of common stock through accelerated share repurchase
            agreements entered into with various investment banks, repurchasing and
            retiring
            approximately 14.36 million shares of common stock at an average initial
            price
            of $34.83 per share. We funded these agreements principally through borrowings
            under our $750 million credit facility and cash on hand. We expect to
            use cash
            generated from operations during 2006 to repay these borrowings. The
            investment
            banks are expected to repurchase an equivalent number of shares in the
            open
            market in the coming months. Once these repurchases are complete, we
            will
            receive or be required to pay a price adjustment (payable at our discretion
            in
            either shares or cash) based principally on the actual cost of the shares
            repurchased by the investment banks.

On
            March
            1, 2006, we reduced our workforce by approximately 275 jobs, or 4% of
            our
            workforce, due to increased competitive pressures and the lost of access
            lines
            over the last several years. We expect to incur a one-time pre-tax charge
            of
            approximately $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2006 in connection
            with the
            severance and related costs.

Controls
                      and Procedures

Evaluation
            of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We
            maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable
            assurances that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
            we
            file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is timely recorded, processed,
            summarized and reported as required. Our Chief Executive Officer, Glen
            F. Post,
            III, and our Chief Financial Officer, R. Stewart Ewing, Jr., have evaluated
            our
            disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Based on
            the
            evaluation, Messrs. Post and Ewing concluded that our disclosure controls
            and
            procedures have been effective in providing reasonable assurance that
            they have
            been timely alerted of material information required to be filed in this
            annual
            report. Since the date of Messrs. Post’s and Ewing’s most recent evaluation,
            there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in
            other
            factors that could significantly affect these controls. The design of
            any system
            of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
            of
            future events and contingencies, and there can be no assurance that any
            design
            will succeed in achieving our stated goals. Because of the inherent limitations
            in any control system, you should be aware that misstatements due to
            error or
            fraud could occur and not be detected.

Reports
            on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.

We
            incorporate by reference into this Item 9A the reports appearing at the
            forefront of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
