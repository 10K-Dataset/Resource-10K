                                     PART I

Item 1.     Business

    General.  Century  Telephone  Enterprises,  Inc.  ("Century")  is a regional
diversified communications company engaged primarily in providing local exchange
telephone services and cellular telephone services.  For the year ended December
31,  1997,   telephone  (local  exchange)  operations  and  wireless  (cellular)
operations provided 59% and 34%,  respectively,  of the consolidated revenues of
Century and its subsidiaries (the "Company"). All of the Company's telephone and
cellular  operations  are  conducted  within the  continental  United States and
Alaska.

    At December 31, 1997, the Company's  local exchange  telephone  subsidiaries
operated over 1.2 million telephone access lines,  primarily in rural,  suburban
and small urban areas in 21 states,  with the largest  customer bases located in
Wisconsin,  Washington,  Alaska, Michigan, Louisiana, Colorado, Ohio, Oregon and
Montana.  According to published sources, the Company is the tenth largest local
exchange  telephone  company in the United  States based on the number of access
lines served.

    At December 31, 1997,  the Company's  majority-owned  and operated  cellular
systems served  approximately  570,000 customers in 21 Metropolitan  Statistical
Areas  ("MSAs"),  primarily  concentrated  in  Michigan,  Louisiana,   Arkansas,
Mississippi,  Wisconsin and Texas, and 23 Rural Service Areas ("RSAs"),  most of
which are in Michigan,  Mississippi,  Wisconsin,  Louisiana  and  Arkansas.  The
Company's  ownership  interest in these markets  represented  approximately  8.1
million pops (the estimated  population of licensed  cellular  telephone markets
multiplied  by the  Company's  proportionate  equity  interest  in the  licensed
operators thereof). At December 31, 1997, the Company also owned minority equity
interests in 12 MSAs and 22 RSAs,  representing  approximately 2.2 million pops.
Of the Company's 10.3 million aggregate pops, approximately 65% are attributable
to the  Company's  MSA  interests,  with  the  balance  attributable  to its RSA
interests.  Except  for five MSAs and four  RSAs,  all of the  cellular  systems
operated by the Company are operated under wireline licenses.  According to data
derived  from  published  sources,  the  Company is the tenth  largest  cellular
telephone company in the United States based on the Company's 10.3 million pops.
See "Wireless  Operations-Regulation and Competition-Cellular Licensing Process"
for more information on MSAs, RSAs and wireline licenses.

    The Company also provides long distance,  call center,  cable television and
interactive  services in certain local and regional markets,  as well as certain
printing and related services.

    Recent  acquisitions  and  dispositions.  On  December  1, 1997 the  Company
acquired Pacific Telecom, Inc. ("PTI") in exchange for $1.503 billion cash. As a
result of the PTI acquisition,  the Company acquired (i) over 660,000  telephone
access lines in four midwestern  states,  seven western states and Alaska,  (ii)
over 88,000 cellular  customers in ten markets located in two midwestern  states
and Alaska,  along with minority equity interests in 12 other cellular  markets,
and (iii) various wireless,  cable television and other  communications  assets.
PTI's  aggregate  cellular  equity  interests  represent 1.9 million  pops.  The
operations  of PTI have been  included in the  Company's  results of  operations
beginning December 1, 1997.

    During late 1997 and early 1998,  the Company  acquired two  security  alarm
businesses  that  provide  services to  approximately  5,900  customers in north
central Louisiana, southern Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi.

    In  December  1997 the  Company  acquired  an  additional  76%  interest  in
Wisconsin RSA 8 which is adjacent to the Company's existing cellular  operations
in southwestern Wisconsin.

    During 1997 the Company exchanged its 89% interest in its competitive access
subsidiary for approximately  4.3 million shares of publicly traded  securities.
Approximately  3.8 million  shares of such stock were sold in November  1997 for
$203 million and the remaining  shares were  converted  into  approximately  1.0
million shares of WorldCom, Inc. in early 1998.

    In January  1997 the  Company  acquired  Pecoco,  Inc.,  a provider of local
exchange  telephone  service in four counties in  Wisconsin.  As a result of the
acquisition,  the Company  acquired (i) more than 7,600 telephone  access lines,
(ii) a minority  interest  in two  cellular  partnerships  serving  Madison  and
Milwaukee,  Wisconsin,  representing approximately 35,000 pops and (iii) certain
cable television assets.

    For several  years prior to 1997,  the Company has expanded  its  operations
through an ongoing program of acquisitions.  Substantial acquisitions during the
last five years include (i) the 1993 acquisition of San Marcos Telephone Company
(22,000  telephone  access lines and 325,000 pops) and (ii) the 1994 acquisition
of Celutel,  Inc. (over 1.1 million pops). The Company continually evaluates the
possibility of acquiring  additional  telecommunications  assets in exchange for
cash, securities or both, and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or
negotiations regarding additional  acquisitions.  Although the Company's primary
focus will continue to be on acquiring telephone and wireless interests that are
proximate to its  properties  or that serve a customer base large enough for the
Company to  operate  efficiently,  other  communications  interests  may also be
acquired.

    In March 1998 the Company  entered into a  definitive  agreement to acquire
certain  local  exchange and  directory  publishing  assets from  Ameritech  for
approximately  $225 million.  Under such  agreement,the  Company would  acquire,
among other  things,  85,000  telephone  access  lines in  northern  and central
Wisconsin.  The  transaction  is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 1998
subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals.

    Other.  As  of  December 31, 1997,  the  Company  had  approximately  5,700
employees,   approximately  1,100  of  whom  were  members  of  eight  different
bargaining units represented by the International  Brotherhood of Teamsters, the
International  Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers,  Communications  Workers of
America, or the NTS Employee Committee. Relations with employees continue to be
generally good.

    Century was  incorporated  under Louisiana law in 1968 to serve as a holding
company for several  telephone  companies  acquired  over the  previous 15 to 20
years.  Century's  principal  executive  offices are located at 100 Century Park
Drive, Monroe, Louisiana 71203 and its telephone number is (318) 388-9000.

                              TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

    According  to  published  sources,  the Company is the tenth  largest  local
exchange  telephone  company  in the United  States,  based on the more than 1.2
million access lines it served at December 31, 1997. All of the Company's access
lines are digitally switched. Through its operating telephone subsidiaries,  the
Company  provides  services to  predominately  rural,  suburban  and small urban
markets  in 21 states.  The table  below sets  forth  certain  information  with
respect to the  Company's  access  lines as of December  31, 1997 and 1996,  and
illustrates  the  substantial  impact the PTI  acquisition  had on the Company's
telephone operations:

=========================================================================

    As indicated in the following table,  the Company has experienced  growth in
its telephone  operations over the past several years, a substantial  portion of
which was  attributable to the acquisition of PTI and other telephone  companies
and to the expansion of services:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Future  growth in  telephone  operations  is expected to be derived from (i)
acquiring  additional  telephone  companies,   (ii)  providing  service  to  new
customers, (iii) increasing network usage and (iv) providing additional services
made  possible  by  advances  in  technology  and  changes  in  regulation.  For
information on developing competitive trends, see "-Regulation and Competition."

    In connection  with its  acquisition of PTI, the Company has reorganized its
telephone  operations  into three  operating  regions,  including  a new western
region  headquartered  in Vancouver,  Washington.  Substantially  all of the new
western region is comprised of local  exchange  companies  ("LECs"),  located in
seven western states and Alaska,  which were acquired in the acquisition of PTI.
As soon as  practical,  the Company plans to offer long  distance,  Internet and
certain other services in most of the local exchange markets acquired in the PTI
acquisition.

Services

    The Company's  local  exchange  telephone  subsidiaries  derive revenue from
providing (i) local telephone  services,  (ii) network access services and (iii)
other related services. The following table reflects the percentage of telephone
operating revenues derived from these respective services:

                                  1997        1996        1995
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
Local service                     27.8%       26.9        26.6
Network access                    60.2        61.2        61.7
Other                             12.0        11.9        11.7
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                 100.0%      100.0       100.0
=================================================================

    Local  service  revenues  are derived from the  provision of local  exchange
telephone  services in the Company's service areas.  Internal access line growth
during 1997,  1996 and 1995 was 4.4%, 4.3% and 4.4%,  respectively.  The Company
believes  that access line growth in the future  will  benefit  from  population
growth in its  service  areas,  acquisitions  and the  increase in the number of
households  maintaining  more than one access line.  The Company  markets  local
Internet access in 340 communities in 12 states,  which the Company believes has
led to an increase in orders for second lines.

    Network access revenues primarily relate to services provided by the Company
to long distance  carriers and other customers in connection with the use of the
Company's  facilities to originate and terminate  interstate and intrastate long
distance  telephone  calls.  Access charges to long distance  carriers and other
customers   are  based  on  tariffed   access   rates  filed  with  the  Federal
Communications   Commission  ("FCC")  for  interstate   services  and  with  the
respective  state  regulatory  agency for  intrastate  services.  Certain of the
Company's  interstate  network access revenues are based on access charges filed
directly  with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue
sharing  arrangements  with other LECs  administered  by the  National  Exchange
Carrier Association ("NECA").

    Certain of the  Company's  intrastate  network  access  revenues are derived
through  access  charges  billed by the  Company  to  intrastate  long  distance
carriers and other LEC  customers.  Such  intrastate  network access charges are
based on  access  tariffs,  which are  subject  to state  regulatory  commission
approval.  Additionally,  certain of the  Company's  intrastate  network  access
revenues,  along with  intrastate  long distance  revenues,  are derived through
revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs.

    The  installation  of digital  switches  and  related  software  has been an
important  component  of the  Company's  growth  strategy  because it allows the
Company to offer enhanced services (such as call forwarding, conference calling,
caller  identification,  selective call ringing and call waiting) and to thereby
increase  utilization of existing access lines. In 1997 the Company continued to
expand its list of premium  services  (such as voice mail and  Internet  access)
offered in certain service areas and aggressively marketed these services.

    The Company is  installing  fiber optic cable in certain of its high traffic
routes and provides  alternative  routing of telephone  service over fiber optic
cable networks in several  strategic  operating areas. At December 31, 1997, the
Company's  telephone  subsidiaries  had over 5,100 miles of fiber optic cable in
use, of which approximately 2,000 miles were acquired in the PTI acquisition.

    Other revenues include revenues related to (i) leasing, selling, installing,
maintaining  and repairing  customer  premise  telecommunications  equipment and
wiring,  (ii)  providing  billing  and  collection  services  for long  distance
companies,  (iii) participating in the publication of local directories and (iv)
providing  Internet  access.  At the end of 1997, the Company  offered  Internet
access in telephone markets  representing 61% of its access lines. Certain large
communications  companies for which the Company  currently  provides billing and
collection  services  continue to indicate  their desire to reduce their billing
and collection expenses,  which may result in future reductions of the Company's
billing and collection revenues.

    For further information on the regulation of the Company's revenues, see
"-Regulation and Competition."

Federal Financing Programs

    Certain of the Company's telephone  subsidiaries receive long-term financing
from the Rural  Utilities  Service ("RUS") and the Rural Telephone Bank ("RTB").
The RUS has made  long-term  loans to  telephone  companies  since  1949 for the
purpose of improving telephone service in rural areas. The RUS continues to make
new  loans  at  interest  rates  that  range  from 5% to 7%  based  on  borrower
qualifications and the cost of funds to the United States  government.  The RTB,
established  in 1971,  makes  long-term  loans at  interest  rates  based on its
average cost of funds as determined by statutory formula (such rates ranged from
5.98% to 6.54% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1997),  and in some cases
makes loans  concurrently with RUS loans. Most of the Company's  telephone plant
is  pledged  or  mortgaged  to secure  obligations  of the  Company's  telephone
subsidiaries to the RUS and RTB. The Company's telephone subsidiaries which have
borrowed from government agencies generally may not loan or advance any funds to
Century, but may pay dividends if certain financial covenants are met.

    For  additional  information  regarding  the  Company's  financing,  see the
Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein.

Regulation and Competition

    Traditionally, LECs have operated as regulated monopolies. Consequently, the
majority of the Company's telephone operations have traditionally been regulated
extensively  by various  state  regulatory  agencies  (generally  called  public
service commissions or public utility  commissions) and by the FCC. As discussed
in greater  detail  below,  passage of the  Telecommunications  Act of 1996 (the
"1996 Act"),  coupled with state  legislative  and  regulatory  initiatives  and
technological  changes,  has  fundamentally  altered the  telephone  industry by
reducing the  regulation of LECs and  permitting  competition in each segment of
the telephone  industry.  Although Century anticipates that these trends towards
reduced regulation and increased  competition will continue,  it is difficult to
determine  the form or  degree  of  future  regulation  and  competition  in the
Company's service areas.

    State  regulation.  The local service rates and intrastate access charges of
substantially all of the Company's telephone subsidiaries are regulated by state
regulatory  commissions.  Most of such commissions have traditionally  regulated
pricing through "rate of return" regulation that focuses on authorized levels of
earnings by LECs. Most of these  commissions  also (i) regulate the purchase and
sale  of  LECs,  (ii)  prescribe   depreciation  rates  and  certain  accounting
procedures and (iii) regulate various other matters,  including  certain service
standards and operating procedures.

    In recent  years,  state  legislatures  and  regulatory  commissions  having
jurisdiction  over the Company's  telephone  subsidiaries  in several  states in
which the Company has  substantial  operations  have either  begun to reduce the
regulation  of  LECs or  have  announced  their  intention  to do so,  and it is
expected that this trend will  continue.  This reduced  regulatory  oversight of
certain of the Company's telephone operations may allow the Company to offer new
and competitive  services faster than under the traditional  regulatory process.
Coincident with these efforts, legislative, regulatory and technological changes
have introduced competition into the local exchange industry. See "-Developments
Affecting Competition."

    Substantially  all  of  the  state  regulatory  commissions  have  statutory
authority,  the specific limits of which vary, to initiate and conduct  earnings
reviews  of the  LECs  that  they  regulate.  As  part of the  movement  towards
deregulation,  several  states are moving away from  traditional  rate of return
regulation  towards price cap  regulation  and incentive  regulation  (which are
similar to the FCC regulations  discussed below),  and are actively  encouraging
larger LECs to adopt these newer forms of price regulation.  The continuation of
this trend may lead to fewer earnings reviews in the future. Currently, however,
most of the  Company's  LECs  continue  to be  regulated  under  rate of  return
regulation.

    During 1995 the Louisiana Public Service  Commission  ("LPSC") adopted a new
regulatory plan for independent telephone companies in Louisiana. For additional
information, see "Regulation and Competition" in Item 7 herein. In 1997 the LPSC
adopted a consumer Price Protection Plan (the "Louisiana Plan"),  effective July
1997,  which impacts all of the Company's  telephone  subsidiaries  operating in
Louisiana.  The new  form of  regulation  will  focus on price  and  quality  of
service.   Under  the  Louisiana   Plan,  the  Company's   Louisiana   telephone
subsidiaries'  local rates will be frozen for a period of three years and access
rates will be frozen for a period of two years.  Although the Louisiana Plan has
no specified term, the LPSC is required to review it by mid-2000.  The Company's
Louisiana  telephone  subsidiaries  have the option to propose a new plan at any
time if the  LPSC  determines  that (i)  effective  competition  exists  or (ii)
unforeseen events threaten the subsidiary's  ability to provide adequate service
or impairs its financial health.

    The Company's  telephone  operations in Wisconsin  that were acquired in the
December  1997  acquisition  of PTI have  been  regulated  under an  alternative
regulation plan (the "Wisconsin Plan") since June 1996. The Wisconsin Plan has a
five-year  term and includes a provision  that allows the  Company's  subsidiary
covered by such plan to adjust  rates  within  specified  parameters  if certain
quality-of-service  and  infrastructure-development  commitments  are  met.  The
Wisconsin Plan also includes initiatives designed to promote competition.

    The Michigan  Public  Service  Commission  regulates the Company's  Michigan
telephone  subsidiaries  pursuant to the parameters  established by the Michigan
Telecommunications  Act of 1995 ("MTA"). The MTA focuses on price and quality of
service as opposed to traditional methods of regulation.

    FCC regulation.  The FCC regulates the interstate  services  provided by the
Company's telephone  subsidiaries  primarily by regulating the interstate access
charges that are billed to long  distance  companies  and other LEC customers by
the Company for use of its local network in connection  with the origination and
termination of interstate telephone calls. Additionally,  the FCC has prescribed
certain rules and regulations  for telephone  companies,  including  regulations
regarding the use of radio frequencies;  a uniform system of accounts; and rules
regarding the separation of costs between jurisdictions and, ultimately, between
interstate services.

    Effective January 1, 1991, the FCC adopted price-cap  regulation relating to
interstate access rates for the Regional Bell Operating  Companies ("RBOCs") and
GTE  Corporation.  An  annual  opportunity  to  elect  price-cap  regulation  is
available  for other  LECs.  Under  price-cap  regulation,  limits  imposed on a
company's  interstate rates will be adjusted  periodically to reflect inflation,
productivity  improvement and changes in certain  non-controllable costs. In May
1993 the FCC adopted an optional incentive  regulatory plan for LECs not subject
to price-cap  regulation.  A LEC electing the optional incentive regulatory plan
would, among other things,  file tariffs based primarily on historical costs and
not be allowed to  participate  in the relevant NECA pooling  arrangements.  The
Company  has  not  elected  price-cap   regulation  or  the  optional  incentive
regulatory  plan, but will continue to evaluate its options on a periodic basis.
Either election,  if made by the Company,  would have to be applicable to all of
the Company's telephone  subsidiaries.  The authorized interstate access rate of
return  for  the  Company's  telephone  subsidiaries  is  11.25%,  which  is the
authorized  rate  established  by the FCC for LECs  not  governed  by  price-cap
regulation or the optional incentive regulatory plan.

    In  February  1996 the FCC  sought  public  comments  on  whether  it should
initiate a rate of return represcription proceeding for LECs that are subject to
rate of return regulation for interstate access revenues. The Company is unaware
of any significant developments in this proceeding.

    In an access charge  reform order  adopted in May 1997,  the FCC changed its
system  of  interstate   access  charges  to  make  them   compatible  with  the
deregulatory  framework  established by the 1996 Act. Such changes are primarily
applicable  to  price-cap  companies.   The  Company's  telephone   subsidiaries
determine   interstate  revenues  under  rate  of  return  regulation  and  are,
therefore,  only minimally  impacted by the access charge reform order.  The FCC
has indicated, however, that a separate access charge reform proceeding would be
initiated for rate of return companies.

    In October 1997 the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking which would,
among other things,  create a federal-state joint board to review jurisdictional
separations  procedures through which the costs of regulated  telecommunications
services are allocated to the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions.

    High-cost support funds, revenue sharing arrangements and related matters. A
significant number of the Company's telephone  subsidiaries recover a portion of
their costs under federal and state cost recovery  mechanisms that traditionally
have  allowed  LECs  serving  small  communities  and  rural  areas  to  provide
communications  services reasonably comparable to those available in urban areas
and at reasonably comparable prices.

    The 1996 Act authorized the establishment of new federal and state universal
service  funds to  provide  continued  support  to  eligible  telecommunications
carriers. In May 1997 the FCC adopted an order on universal service, as mandated
by the 1996 Act.  In the order,  the FCC ruled that  rural  telephone  companies
which are  designated  eligible  telecommunications  carriers  will  continue to
receive  universal  service  funding.  Each of the  Company's  LECs  has been so
designated by its respective state regulatory agency. As a result, the Company's
LECs will  continue to receive  payments  under the federal  support  mechanisms
currently in effect until the FCC adopts  funding  support  mechanisms  based on
forward-looking  economic costs, which it is required to do, but no earlier than
January  2001.  Although  the  Company  anticipates  that  it may  experience  a
reduction  in its  federal  support  revenues  at  some  point  in  the  future,
management  believes it is premature  to assess or estimate the ultimate  impact
thereof.  During 1997 and 1996 the  Company's  telephone  subsidiaries  received
$65.4 million (of which $4.6 million was applicable to the PTI  properties)  and
$49.3 million, respectively, from the federal Universal Service Fund.

    As part of its  universal  service  order,  the FCC also  established  a new
program to provide up to $2.25 billion of discounted telecommunications services
annually to schools and libraries, commencing January 1998. In addition, the FCC
established a $400 million annual fund to provide discounted  telecommunications
services for rural health care providers.  All communications carriers providing
interstate  telecommunications  services,  including the Company's  LECs and its
cellular  and long  distance  operations,  are required to  contribute  to these
programs.  In December  1997 the FCC,  while  reserving the right to adjust such
amounts if demand  increases,  modified the amounts to be  collected  during the
first six months of 1998 to no more than $625 million for schools and  libraries
and no more than $50 million for rural health care providers. The FCC has stated
that local exchange telephone companies will recover their funding contributions
in their rates for interstate services. The Company currently estimates that the
contribution  by its  cellular  and  long  distance  operations  for  1998  will
approximate $3.5 million.

    Some  of the  Company's  telephone  subsidiaries  operate  in  states  where
traditional  cost recovery  mechanisms,  including  rate  structures,  are under
evaluation  or have been  modified.  See  "-State  Regulation."  There can be no
assurance  that these  states  will  continue  to provide  for cost  recovery at
current levels.

    Substantially  all of the Company's LECs concur with the common line tariffs
and certain of the  Company's  LECs concur  with the traffic  sensitive  tariffs
filed  by the  NECA;  such  LECs  participate  in  the  access  revenue  sharing
arrangements  administered  by the  NECA  for  interstate  services.  All of the
intrastate  network  access  revenues of the Company's  LECs are based on access
charges, cost separation studies or special settlement arrangements.
See "-Services."

    Certain  long  distance  carriers  continue to request  that  certain of the
Company's LECs reduce  intrastate  access tariffed rates.  There is no assurance
that these requests will not result in decreased access revenues.

    Developments affecting competition. The communications industry is currently
undergoing fundamental changes which may have a significant impact on the future
operations and financial performance of all communications companies.  Primarily
as a result of legislative and regulatory initiatives and technological changes,
competition  has been  introduced and encouraged in each sector of the telephone
industry,  including, most recently, the local exchange sector. As a result, the
number of companies offering competitive services has increased.

    As indicated  above,  in February 1996 Congress  enacted the 1996 Act, which
obligates LECs to permit  competitors to  interconnect  their  facilities to the
LEC's  network  and to take  various  other  steps that are  designed to promote
competition.  The 1996 Act  imposes  several  duties on a LEC if it  receives  a
specific  request  from  another  entity  which seeks to connect with or provide
services using the LEC's network.  In addition,  each incumbent LEC is obligated
to  (i)  negotiate  interconnection  agreements  in  good  faith,  (ii)  provide
"unbundled"  access to all aspects of the LEC's  network,  (iii) offer resale of
its  telecommunications  services at wholesale rates and (iv) permit competitors
to  collocate  its  physical  plant on the LEC's  property,  or provide  virtual
collocation if physical  collocation is not  practicable.  Although the 1996 Act
provides  certain  exemptions  for  rural  LECs  such as those  operated  by the
Company,  the  FCC's  August  1996  order  implementing  most of the 1996  Act's
interconnection   provisions   placed  the  burden  of  proving  the  continuing
availability  of these  exemptions on rural LECs. In July 1997 the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit overturned several provisions of the FCC's August
1996 interconnection  order,  including the rules placing the burden of proof on
rural LECs to retain their rural  exemption.  This decision has been appealed to
the  United  States  Supreme  Court.  States  are  permitted  to  adopt  laws or
regulations that provide for greater competition than is mandated under the 1996
Act.  Management  believes that competition in its telephone  service areas will
ultimately increase as a result of the 1996 Act, although the form and degree of
competition  cannot be  ascertained  until such time as the FCC (and, in certain
instances,   state  regulatory   commissions)  adopts  final  and  nonappealable
implementing regulations.

    Substantially  all of the 21 states in which the Company provides  telephone
services  have  taken  legislative  or  regulatory  steps to  further  introduce
competition  into  the  LEC  business.  Largely  as a  result  thereof,  several
competitive  access  providers  originally  organized to provide  redundancy  or
access services have begun,  during the past few years,  to provide  competitive
local exchange services,  principally in larger urban areas.  Moreover,  several
well-capitalized long distance, cable television and electric utility companies,
along with several start-up  companies,  have also begun to provide  competitive
local  exchange  services or  announced  their  intention to do so, and wireless
companies and other emerging technology  companies are expected to explore their
opportunities in this market. While the Company is aware of only a few companies
that have  requested  authorization  to provide  local  exchange  service in the
Company's  service areas, the Company expects to face additional  competition in
the future from competitive providers, especially in its operating areas located
near larger urban areas.

    In addition to receiving  services  directly from  companies  competing with
incumbent  LECs,  long  distance  companies  and other users of toll service are
expected to increasingly seek other means to bypass LECs' switching services and
local distribution  facilities.  Certain interexchange carriers provide services
which allow users to divert their traffic from LECs' usage-sensitive services to
their  flat-rate  services.  In addition,  users or long distance  companies may
construct,  modify or lease  facilities to transmit traffic directly from a user
to a long distance company.  Cable television companies,  in particular,  may be
able to modify their  networks to partially or  completely  bypass the Company's
local  network.  Moreover,  users may choose to use wireless  services to bypass
LECs'  switching   services.   Although  certain  of  the  Company's   telephone
subsidiaries  have  experienced  a loss of traffic to such  bypass,  the Company
believes that the impact of such loss on revenues has not been significant.

    Historically,  cellular telephone services have complemented traditional LEC
services.  However,  the Company anticipates that existing and emerging wireless
technologies  will  increasingly  compete with LEC services.  Technological  and
regulatory developments in cellular telephone, personal communications services,
digital microwave,  coaxial cable,  fiber optics,  local-multipoint-distribution
services  and other  wired and  wireless  technologies  are  expected to further
permit the  development of alternatives to traditional  landline  services.  For
further information on certain of these developments,  see "Wireless  Operations
Regulation and Competition."

    To  the  extent  that  the  telephone  industry   increasingly   experiences
competition,   the  size  and  resources  of  each  respective   competitor  may
increasingly  influence its  prospects.  Many companies  currently  providing or
planning  to  provide  competitive  communication  services  have  substantially
greater financial and marketing resources than the Company,  and several are not
subject to the same regulatory constraints as the Company.

    The Company  anticipates  that the  traditional  operations  of LECs will be
increasingly  impacted  by  continued  technological  developments  as  well  as
legislative and regulatory  initiatives affecting the ability of LECs to provide
new services and the  capability of cable  television  companies,  long distance
companies,   competitive   local  exchange   providers  and  others  to  provide
competitive  LEC  services.   Competition  relating  to  services  traditionally
provided  solely by LECs is expected to initially  affect large urban areas to a
greater extent than rural, suburban and small urban areas such as those in which
the  Company   operates.   The  Company   intends  to  actively   monitor  these
developments,  to observe the effect of emerging  competitive  trends in initial
competitive markets and to continue to evaluate new business  opportunities that
may arise out of future technological, legislative and regulatory developments.

    The Company  anticipates that regulatory  changes and competitive  pressures
may result in future revenue  reductions in its telephone  operations.  However,
the Company  anticipates  that such  reductions may be minimized by increases in
revenues  attributable  to the  continued  demand for enhanced  services and new
product offerings.  While the Company expects its telephone revenues to continue
to grow, its internal  telephone  revenue  growth rate may slow during  upcoming
periods.

                               WIRELESS OPERATIONS

    At  December  31,  1997,  the  Company's   cellular   holdings   represented
approximately  10.3 million pops,  of which 65% were  applicable to MSAs and 35%
were RSA pops.  According to data derived from published sources, the Company is
the tenth largest cellular  telephone  company in the United States based on the
Company's 10.3 million pops.

    Immediately prior to the Company's  acquisition of PTI in December 1997, the
Company's ratio of owned cellular pops to telephone  access lines was 15:1. As a
result of the Company's  acquisition of the PTI properties,  the Company's ratio
of owned cellular pops to telephone  access lines has decreased to 8:1.  Certain
of the  Company's  cellular  markets  overlap  some of the  Company's  telephone
service areas.

Cellular Industry

    The cellular  telephone  industry has been in existence for approximately 15
years in the United  States.  The industry has grown  significantly  during this
period and cellular service is now available in  substantially  all areas of the
United   States.   According   to  the  Cellular   Telecommunications   Industry
Association,  at June 1997 there were  estimated to be over 48 million  cellular
customers across the United States.

    Cellular  telephone  service  is  capable  of  high-quality,   high-capacity
communications to and from  vehicle-mounted and hand-held  telephones.  Cellular
systems, if properly designed and equipped, are capable of handling thousands of
calls  at any  given  time  and are  capable  of  providing  service  to tens of
thousands of subscribers in a market.

    Until recently,  substantially  all radio  transmissions of cellular systems
were  conducted on an analog  basis.  Technological  developments  involving the
application of digital radio  technology  offer certain  advantages  over analog
technologies, including expanding the capacity of mobile communications systems,
improving voice clarity, permitting the introduction of new services, and making
such  systems  more  private.  Providers of certain  services  competitive  with
cellular have incorporated  digital technology into their operations.  In recent
years most  major  cellular  carriers  have  installed  digital  cellular  voice
transmission  facilities  in certain  of their  systems,  principally  in larger
markets.  Digital service is now operational in ten of the Company's MSA markets
and the Company  plans to  significantly  expand the  marketing  of such service
during 1998. See "-Regulation and  Competition-Developments  Affecting  Wireless
Competition."

Construction and Maintenance

    The construction  and maintenance of cellular systems is capital  intensive.
Although all of the Company's MSA and RSA systems are  operational,  the Company
has  continued  to add  cell  sites to  increase  coverage,  provide  additional
capacity,  expand areas where hand-held  cellular phones may be used and improve
the quality of these systems.  In 1997 the Company completed  construction of 49
cell sites in markets  operated by the Company and added 155 cell sites  through
acquisitions.  At December 31, 1997, the Company  operated 558 cell sites in its
majority-owned markets.

    During  the last few years the  Company  upgraded  certain  portions  of its
cellular systems to be capable of providing digital service. Such service became
operational  in certain  markets  during  1996 and 1997  using the TDMA  digital
standard and the Company plans to install digital voice transmission  facilities
in  other  markets  in  1998.  See  "-Regulation  and   Competition-Developments
Affecting Wireless  Competition." Capital expenditures related to majority-owned
and operated  cellular  systems totaled  approximately  $39 million in 1997. Due
partially  to  previously  planned  projects  carried over from 1997 and the PTI
acquisition,   such  capital   expenditures  for  1998  are  anticipated  to  be
approximately $90 million.

Strategy

    The  Company's  business  development  strategy for its  cellular  telephone
operations   is  to  secure   operating   control  of  service  areas  that  are
geographically clustered. Clustered cellular systems aid the Company's marketing
efforts and provide various operating and service advantages.  Approximately 43%
of the  Company's  pops in  markets  operated  by the  Company  are in a single,
contiguous cluster of eight MSAs and nine RSAs in Michigan; another 17% are in a
cluster of five MSAs and seven RSAs in northern and central Louisiana,  southern
Arkansas and eastern Texas. See "-The Company's Cellular Interests."

    Another component of the Company's strategy for cellular operations includes
capturing  revenues from roaming  service.  Roaming service revenues are derived
from calls made in one cellular  service area by subscribers  from other service
areas.  Roaming service is made possible by technical  standards  requiring that
cellular telephones be functionally  compatible with the cellular systems in all
United States market areas. The Company charges premium rates (compared to rates
charged  to the  Company's  customers)  for  roaming  service  provided  to most
non-Company  customers.  The Company's  Michigan cellular  properties  include a
significant  portion of the  interstate  highway  corridor  between  Chicago and
Detroit.  Its Louisiana properties include an east-west interstate highway and a
north-south interstate highway which intersect in its Louisiana cellular service
area. Its Mississippi  properties include two east-west  interstate highways and
two  north-south  interstate  highways.  See  "-Services,  Customers  and System
Usage."

Marketing

    The Company  markets its  cellular  services  through  several  distribution
channels,  including its direct sales force, retail outlets owned by the Company
and independent agents. At December 31, 1997, the Company's cellular sales force
consisted of approximately  375 sales employees,  which generated  approximately
one-half  of the  Company's  new  subscribers  in 1997,  and  approximately  525
independent  agents. Each sales employee and independent agent solicits cellular
customers  exclusively for the Company.  Company sales employees are compensated
by salary and commission and independent sales agents are paid commissions.  The
Company  advertises its services  through various means,  including direct mail,
billboard, magazine, radio, television and newspaper advertisements.

    The  sales  and  marketing  costs  of  obtaining  new  subscribers   include
advertising and a direct expense  applicable to most new subscribers,  either in
the form of a commission payment to an agent or a salary/incentive  payment to a
direct sales  person.  In addition,  the Company  discounts the cost of cellular
telephone equipment,  and periodically runs promotions which provide some amount
of initial  activation,  access or airtime free to new subscribers.  The average
cost of acquiring  each new customer  ($280 in 1997)  remains one of the largest
expenses in conducting the Company's cellular operations.

Services, Customers and System Usage

    There are a number of different types of cellular  telephones,  all of which
are currently  compatible with cellular systems nationwide.  The Company sells a
full range of  vehicle-mounted,  transportable,  and hand-held portable cellular
telephones.

    The Company charges its  subscribers for access to its systems,  for minutes
of use and for enhanced services,  such as voice mail. A subscriber may purchase
certain of these  services  separately  or may purchase  rate plans which bundle
these  services in  different  ways and are  designed to fit  different  calling
patterns.  While the Company  historically  has typically  charged its customers
separately  for  custom-calling  features,  air time in excess  of the  packaged
amount, and toll calls, it currently offers plans which include features such as
unlimited  toll calls and unlimited  weekend  calling in certain  calling areas.
Custom-calling  features  provided  by  the  Company  include   call-forwarding,
call-waiting, three-way calling and no-answer transfer. The Company offers voice
message service in many of its markets.  In the Company's  markets where digital
service is  operational,  customers can subscribe to caller ID and other digital
enhancements.

    Cellular  customers  come from a wide range of  occupations.  They typically
include a large proportion of individuals who work outside of their office, such
as employees in the construction, real estate, wholesale and retail distribution
businesses,  and professionals.  More customers are selecting portable and other
transportable  cellular  telephones as these units become more compact and fully
featured,  as well as more  attractively  priced.  The Company's average monthly
cellular  service revenue per customer  declined to $61 in 1997 from $63 in 1996
and $66 in 1995. The Company's  average service revenue per customer is expected
to decline in 1998 as a result of the PTI acquisition (due to PTI's historically
lower average monthly  service  revenue per customer).  Such average revenue per
customer may further decline (i) as market penetration  increases and additional
lower usage  customers  are  activated and (ii) as  competitive  pressures  from
current and future wireless communications providers intensify. See "-Regulation
and Competition."

    Most  cellular  systems  allow a  customer  to place or  receive a call in a
cellular service area away from the customer's home market area. The Company has
entered into  "roaming  agreements"  with  operators of other  cellular  systems
covering  virtually all markets in the United States;  such agreements offer the
Company's  customers the opportunity to roam in these markets.  Also, a customer
of a  participating  non-Company  system  traveling in a market  operated by the
Company where this arrangement is in effect is able to automatically  make calls
on the Company's system.  The charge to a non-Company  customer for this service
is typically at premium  rates,  and is billed by the Company to the  customer's
home  system,  which  then  bills  the  customer.  In most  instances,  based on
competitive factors and financial considerations,  the Company charges an amount
to its customers that is equal to or lower than the amount  actually  charged by
the  servicing  cellular  carrier  for  roaming.  The Company  anticipates  that
competitive  factors and industry  consolidation  may place further  pressure on
charging premium roaming rates.  For additional  information on roaming revenue,
see "-Strategy."

    Roamer fraud, a cellular  industry problem,  occurs when cellular  telephone
equipment is  programmed  to conceal the true identity and location of the user.
The Company and the industry have implemented  extensive fraud control processes
in an attempt to minimize roamer fraud.

    Churn rate (the average  percentage  of cellular  customers  that  terminate
service each month) is an industry-wide  concern.  A significant  portion of the
churn in the Company's  markets is due to the Company  disconnecting  service to
cellular customers for nonpayment of their bills. In addition, the Company faces
substantial  competition  from the other  cellular  provider  in  certain of its
markets and has begun to face  competition  from PCS  providers  in a few of its
markets.  The  Company's  churn  rate was 2.31% in 1997 and  2.37% in 1996.  The
Company  is  attempting  to lower its churn  rate by  increasing  its  proactive
customer service efforts and through the  implementation of additional  customer
retention programs.

    During recent years, the Company's cellular subsidiaries  experienced strong
subscriber growth in the fourth quarter, primarily due to holiday season sales.

    The following  table  summarizes,  among other things,  certain  information
about the Company's customers and market penetration:

The Company's Cellular Interests

    The Company  obtained the right to provide  cellular service through (i) the
FCC's licensing  process described below,  under which it received  interests in
wireline licenses, and (ii) its acquisition program, under which it has acquired
interests in both wireline and non-wireline licenses. The table below sets forth
certain  information  with respect to the interests in cellular systems that the
Company owned as of December 31, 1997:

Operations

    A substantial number of the cellular systems in MSAs operated by the Company
are owned by limited  partnerships  in which the  Company  is a general  partner
("MSA  Partnerships").  Most of these  partnerships  are governed by partnership
agreements  with  similar  terms,  including,   among  other  things,  customary
provisions concerning capital contributions,  sharing of profits and losses, and
dissolution  and  termination  of the  partnership.  Most of  these  partnership
agreements vest complete operational control of the partnership with the general
partner.  The general partner  typically has the power to manage,  supervise and
conduct  the  affairs of the  partnership,  make all  decisions  appropriate  in
connection with the business purposes of the partnership,  and incur obligations
and execute  agreements on behalf of the  partnership.  The general partner also
may make  decisions  regarding  the time and  amount of cash  contributions  and
distributions,  and the nature,  timing and extent of construction,  without the
consent of the other partners.  The Company owns more than 50% of all of the MSA
Partnerships.

    A substantial number of the cellular systems in RSAs operated by the Company
are also owned by limited or general partnerships in which the Company is either
the general or managing partner (the "RSA Partnerships"). These partnerships are
governed by partnership agreements with varying terms and provisions. In many of
these partnerships,  the noncontrolling partners have the right to vote on major
issues  such  as  the  annual  budget  and  system  design.  In a few  of  these
partnerships,  the Company's  management position is for a limited term (similar
to a management  contract) and the other  partners in the  partnership  have the
right to change managers,  with or without cause. The Company owns less than 50%
of some of the RSA Partnerships.

    The  partnership   agreements  for  both  the  MSA   Partnerships   and  RSA
Partnerships generally contain provisions granting all partners a right of first
refusal in the event a partner desires to transfer a partnership interest.  This
restriction on transfer can under certain  circumstances  make these partnership
interests more difficult to sell to a third party.

Revenue

    The following table reflects the major revenue  categories for the Company's
wireless operations as a percentage of wireless operating revenues in 1997, 1996
and 1995.

    For further information on these revenue categories, see "-Services,
Customers and System Usage."

Regulation and Competition

    As discussed  below,  the FCC and various state public  utility  commissions
regulate,   among  other  things,   the  licensing,   construction,   operation,
interconnection  arrangements,   sale  and  acquisition  of  cellular  telephone
systems.

    Competition   between  cellular   providers  in  each  market  is  conducted
principally  on the basis of services and  enhancements  offered,  the technical
quality  and  coverage of the system,  quality  and  responsiveness  of customer
service,  and  price.  Competition  may be  intense.  For a listing of the other
cellular  operator  in cellular  markets  operated  by the  Company,  see "- The
Company's Cellular  Interests." Under applicable law, the Company is required to
permit the reselling of its services.  In certain  larger markets and in certain
market segments,  competition  from resellers may be significant.  There is also
substantial  competition for sales agents.  Certain of the Company's competitors
have substantially greater assets and resources than the Company.

    Cellular licensing process. The term "MSA" means a Metropolitan  Statistical
Area for which the FCC has granted a cellular operating license.  The term "RSA"
means a Rural  Service  Area for which the FCC has granted a cellular  operating
license.  During  the 1980's  and early  1990's,  the FCC  awarded  two  10-year
licenses to provide cellular service in each market.  Initially, one license was
reserved  for  companies  offering  local  telephone  service in the market (the
wireline carrier) and one license was available for firms  unaffiliated with the
local telephone company (the non-wireline carrier).  Since mid-1986, the FCC has
permitted  telephone  companies  or  their  affiliates  to  acquire  control  of
non-wireline  licenses  in markets in which  they do not hold  interests  in the
wireline license. The FCC has issued a decision that grants a renewal expectancy
during the license  renewal  period to incumbent  licensees  that  substantially
comply with the terms and  conditions of their cellular  authorizations  and the
FCC's regulations. The licenses for the MSA markets operated by the Company were
initially  granted  between 1984 and 1987,  and licenses for operated  RSAs were
initially  granted  between  1989 and 1991.  Thus far,  the Company has received
10-year  extensions of all of its licenses  that have become  subject to renewal
since their original grant dates.

    The  completion  of an  acquisition  involving  the transfer of control of a
cellular  system  requires prior FCC approval and, in certain cases,  receipt of
other federal and state  regulatory  approvals.  The  acquisition  of a minority
interest  generally  does not require FCC  approval.  Whenever  FCC  approval is
required,  any  interested  party may file a  petition  to  dismiss  or deny the
application for approval of the proposed transfer.

    In  addition  to  regulation  by the FCC,  cellular  systems  are subject to
certain Federal Aviation  Administration tower height regulations concerning the
siting and construction of cellular transmitter towers and antennas.

    Cellular  operators  are also subject to state and local  regulation in some
instances.   Although  the  FCC  has  pre-empted  the  states  from   exercising
jurisdiction  in  the  areas  of  licensing,   technical  standards  and  market
structure,  certain  states  require  cellular  operators  to be  certified.  In
addition,  some  state  authorities  regulate  certain  aspects  of  a  cellular
operator's  business,  including certain aspects of pricing,  the resale of long
distance  service to its customers,  the technical  arrangements and charges for
interconnection  with the  landline  network,  and the  transfer of interests in
cellular  systems.  The siting and  construction of the cellular  facilities may
also be subject to state or local zoning, land use and other local regulations.

    Developments  affecting  wireless  competition.  Competition in the cellular
industry has increased due to continued and rapid technological  advances in the
communications field, coupled with legislative and regulatory changes.

    Several recent FCC initiatives have resulted in the allocation of additional
radio  spectrum or the issuance of licenses for emerging  mobile  communications
technologies  that are  competitive  with the  Company's  cellular and telephone
operations, including personal communication services ("PCS"). Although there is
no universally recognized definition of PCS, the term is generally used to refer
to wireless  services to be provided by  licensees  operating in the 1850 MHz to
1990 MHz  radio  frequency  band  using  microcells  and  high-capacity  digital
technology.  In 1996 and early 1997 the FCC auctioned up to six PCS licenses per
market.  Two 30MHz frequency blocks were awarded for each of the 51 Rand McNally
Major Trading Areas ("MTAs"),  while one 30MHz and three 10MHz frequency  blocks
were awarded for each of the 493 Rand McNally Basic Trading Areas ("BTAs").

    PCS  technology  permits PCS  operators to offer  wireless  data,  image and
multimedia  services.  The largest PCS providers commenced initial operations in
late 1996 and increased their operations in 1997. These providers have initially
focused  on  larger  markets,  and  have  generally  marketed  PCS  as  being  a
competitive  service to  cellular.  Thus far the  Company  has  experienced  PCS
competition in only a few of its cellular markets.  The extent to which PCS will
offer services in the Company's  markets that are  complementary  or competitive
with  cellular  services  is  uncertain,  and is expected  to be  influenced  by
continuing developments in PCS and cellular technologies.

    In addition to PCS, users and potential  users of cellular  systems may find
their   communication   needs   satisfied  by  other   current  and   developing
technologies.  Several  years ago the FCC  authorized  the  licensees of certain
specialized  mobile radio  service  ("SMR")  systems  (which  historically  have
generally  been used by taxicabs and tow truck  operators)  to  configure  their
systems  into  digital  networks  that  operate in a manner  similar to cellular
systems.  Such systems are commonly referred to as enhanced  specialized  mobile
radio  service  ("ESMR")  systems.  The Company  believes  that ESMR systems are
operating in a few of its cellular  markets.  One  well-established  ESMR
provider has constructed a nationwide  digital mobile  communications  system to
compete with cellular systems.  Other similar  communication  services that have
the  technical  capability  to  handle  wireless  telephone  calls  may  provide
competition  in certain  markets,  although  these  services  currently lack the
subscriber capacity of cellular systems.  Paging or beeper services that feature
text  message and data  display as well as tones may be adequate  for  potential
subscribers  who do not need to communicate  with the caller.  Mobile  satellite
systems,  in which  transmissions  are between mobile units and satellites,  may
ultimately be successful  in obtaining  market share from cellular  systems that
communicate directly to land-based stations.

    Recently,  several large cellular providers have merged with other companies
or formed joint ventures. Several of these joint ventures pooled their resources
to purchase PCS licenses and to develop the associated markets.  Many current or
potential  competitors of the Company have  substantially  greater financial and
marketing resources than the Company.

    Although it is uncertain how PCS, SMR,  ESMR,  mobile  satellites  and other
emerging   technologies  will  ultimately   affect  the  Company,   the  Company
anticipates  that it will face  increased  competition in some of its markets in
the near term. However,  management believes that providing digital services and
applying new  microcellular  technologies  should permit its cellular systems to
provide  services  comparable with the emerging  technologies  described  above,
although  no  assurances  can be given  that  this will  happen  or that  future
technological  advances or  legislative  or  regulatory  changes will not create
additional sources of competition.

                                OTHER OPERATIONS

    The Company  provides  long  distance,  call center,  cable  television  and
interactive  services in certain local and regional markets,  as well as certain
printing and related services. The results of these operations,  which accounted
for 7.0% and 2.4%,  respectively,  of the  Company's  consolidated  revenues and
operating income during 1997, are reflected for financial  reporting purposes in
the "Other operations" section in operating income.

    Long distance.  In 1996 the Company began marketing long distance service in
all of its equal access  telephone  operating  areas.  At December 31, 1997, the
Company  provided long distance  services to  approximately  172,000  customers.
Although  the Company  owns and  operates  long  distance  switches in LaCrosse,
Wisconsin and San Marcos,  Texas,  it  anticipates  that most of its future long
distance service revenues will be provided by reselling  service  purchased from
other facilities-based long distance providers.  The Company intends to continue
to  expand  its  long   distance   business,   principally   through   reselling
arrangements.

    Call center.  The Company provides certain operator  services for retail and
wholesale  markets.  The retail market consists primarily of the hospitality and
payphone  industries.   The  wholesale  market  consists  of  other  independent
telephone companies and interexchange carriers.

    PCS. In early 1997 the Company was awarded 12 PCS licenses,  11 of which are
in Michigan,  in connection  with the FCC's auctions of 10MHz PCS licenses.  The
licenses cover areas with a population of approximately 4.0 million. As a result
of the PTI acquisition,  the Company acquired PCS licenses that cover areas with
a population  of  approximately  4.1  million.  Such  licenses  should allow the
Company to provide PCS as a fixed wireless  local loop  alternative to the LEC's
service in the areas covered by the PCS licenses.  Approximately  $20 million of
the Company's 1998 capital  expenditure  budget is for development of certain of
the Company's PCS networks.

    Other.  The  Company,  through  one or  more of its  subsidiaries,  provides
audiotext  services;  printing,  database  management  and direct mail services;
cable television services;  and security alarm services.  The Company also holds
minority equity investments in certain communications companies.

    Certain  service  subsidiaries  of  the  company  provide  installation  and
maintenance  services,  materials and supplies,  and  managerial,  technical and
accounting  services to the telephone and wireless  operating  subsidiaries.  In
addition,  Century provides and bills management services to subsidiaries and in
certain  instances makes  interest-bearing  advances to finance  construction of
plant and  purchases  of  equipment.  These  transactions  are  recorded  by the
Company's regulated telephone subsidiaries at their cost to the extent permitted
by regulatory  authorities.  Intercompany  profit on transactions with regulated
affiliates  is limited to a  reasonable  return on  investment  and has not been
eliminated in connection with consolidating the results of operations of Century
and its subsidiaries.  Such intercompany profit is reflected in operating income
in the "Other operations" segment.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    This report on Form 10-K and other  documents filed by the Company under the
federal  securities laws include,  and future oral or written  statements of the
Company and its  management  may include,  certain  forward-looking  statements,
including   without   limitation   statements  with  respect  to  the  Company's
anticipated future operating and financial performance  (including the impact of
pending  acquisitions),  financial position and liquidity,  growth opportunities
and growth rates,  business and competitive outlook,  investment and expenditure
plans, pricing plans,  strategic  alternatives,  business strategies,  and other
similar  statements of  expectations or objectives that are highlighted by works
such as "expects,"  "anticipates,"  "intends," "plans," "believes,"  "projects,"
"seeks,"  "estimates,"  "should," and "may," and variations  thereof and similar
expressions.  Such forward-looking  statements are subject to uncertainties that
could  cause  the  Company's  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from such
statements.  These uncertainties  include but are not limited to those set forth
below:

    o the effects of ongoing deregulation in the telecommunications  industry as
a result of the 1996 Act and other  similar  federal and state  legislation  and
federal and state regulations enacted  thereunder,  including without limitation
(i) greater than anticipated  competition in the Company's  predominately  rural
local  exchange  telephone  markets  resulting  therefrom,   (ii)  greater  than
anticipated  reductions in revenues  received from the Universal Service Fund or
other current or future  federal and state support funds  designed to compensate
LECs that provide  services in  high-cost  markets,  (iii) the final  outcome of
regulatory and judicial  proceedings with respect to interconnection  agreements
and access  charge  reforms and (iv) future state  regulatory  actions  taken in
response to the 1996 Act.

    o the effects of greater than  anticipated  competition from PCS, SMR, ESMR,
satellite or other wireless companies,  including without limitation competition
requiring new pricing or marketing strategies or new product offerings,  and the
attendant  risk  that the  Company  will not be able to  respond  on a timely or
profitable basis.

    o possible  changes in the demand for the  Company's  products and services,
including  without  limitation  (i) lower than  anticipated  demand for  premium
telephone services or for additional access lines per household, (ii) lower than
anticipated demand for wireless telephone services, whether caused by changes in
economic conditions, technology,  competition, health concerns or otherwise, and
(iii)  reduced  demand  for the  Company's  access  or  billing  and  collection
services.

    o the Company's ability to successfully  introduce new offerings on a timely
and cost-effective basis,  including without limitation the Company's ability to
(i) expand  successfully its long distance and Internet offerings to new markets
(including  those  acquired in  December  1997 in the PTI  acquisition  or to be
acquired in connection  with future  acquisitions),  (ii) offer bundled  service
packages on terms  attractive to its customers and (iii)  successfully  initiate
PCS services in its licensed markets.

    o the  risks  inherent  in rapid  technological  change,  including  without
limitation (i) the lack of assurance that the Company's ongoing wireless network
improvements  will be sufficient to meet or exceed the  capabilities and quality
of  competing  networks,  (ii)  technological  developments  that could make the
Company's analog and digital wireless networks  uncompetitive or obsolete,  such
as the risk  that the  Time  Division  Multiple  Access  technology  used by the
Company  will be  uncompetitive  with  Code  Division  Multiple  Access or other
digital technologies, and (iii) the risk that technologies will not be developed
by the  Company  on a timely or  cost-effective  basis or perform  according  to
expectations.

    o  regulatory  limits on the  Company's  ability  to change  its  prices for
telephone services in response to competitive pressures.

    o the Company's ability to effectively manage its growth,  including without
limitation the Company's ability to (i) integrate the operations of PTI acquired
in December 1997 into the Company's operations, (ii) achieve projected economies
of scale and cost savings,  (iii) meet pro forma cash flow projections developed
by management in valuing newly-acquired  businesses and (iv) implement necessary
internal controls and retain and attract key personnel.

    o any  difficulties  in the Company's  ability to expand through  additional
acquisitions, whether caused by financing constraints, a decrease in the pool of
attractive  target  companies,   or  competition  for  acquisitions  from  other
interested buyers.

    o  higher  than  anticipated  wireless  operating  costs  due to churn or to
fraudulent uses of the Company's networks.

    o the lack of  assurance  that the Company can compete  effectively  against
better-capitalized competitors.

    o  the  future   unavailability  of  SFAS  71  to  the  Company's  telephone
subsidiaries.

    o the effects of more general factors, including without limitation:

      .  changes in general industry and market conditions and growth rates
      .  changes in interest rates or other general national, regional or local
economic conditions
      .  changes in legislation, regulation or public policy, including changes
in federal rural financing programs
      .  unanticipated increases in capital, operating or administrative costs,
or the impact of new business opportunities requiring significant up-front
investments
      .  the continued availability of financing in amounts, and on terms and
conditions, necessary to support the Company's operations
      .  changes in the Company's relationships with vendors
      .  changes in the Company's senior debt ratings
      .  unfavorable outcomes of regulatory or legal proceedings, including
rate proceedings
      .  changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as
required by generally accepted accounting principles.

    For additional  information,  see the description of the Company's  business
included  above, as well as Item 7 to this report.  Due to these  uncertainties,
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon the Company's forward-looking
statements,  which speak only as of the date hereof.  The Company  undertakes no
obligation  to update or revise any of its  forward-looking  statements  for any
reason.

                                  OTHER MATTERS

    The Company has certain  obligations based on federal,  state and local laws
relating to the protection of the environment.  Costs of compliance through 1997

            Results of Operations

                              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

    Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc. is a regional diversified communications
company  engaged  primarily in providing local exchange  telephone  services and
cellular  telephone  services.  Century  Telephone  Enterprises,  Inc.  and  its
subsidiaries (the "Company")  significantly expanded its operations by acquiring
Pacific Telecom, Inc. ("PTI") on December 1, 1997 in exchange for $1.503 billion
cash.  As a result of the  acquisition,  the Company  acquired  (i) over 660,000
telephone access lines, (ii) over 88,000 cellular  subscribers and (iii) various
wireless,  cable television and other  communications  assets. The operations of
PTI are included in the Company's  results of operations  beginning  December 1,
1997.  See  Major  Acquisition  and Note 2 of Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements for additional information. During the three years ended December 31,
1997, the Company has acquired various other telephone and cellular  operations,
the impact of which has not been material to the financial  position and results
of operations of the Company.

    In  May  1997  the  Company  sold  its  majority-owned   competitive  access
subsidiary  to  Brooks  Fiber  Properties,   Inc.  ("Brooks")  in  exchange  for
approximately  4.3 million shares of Brooks' common stock.  In November 1997 the
Company sold  approximately  3.8 million shares of such stock. See Gain on Sales
of Assets for additional information.

    The net income of the  Company for 1997  increased  to $256.0  million  from
$129.1 million during 1996 and $114.8 million during 1995.  Diluted earnings per
share for 1997  increased to $2.80 from $1.43 during 1996 and $1.31 during 1995.
Excluding  gain on sales of  assets,  the  Company's  net  income  (and  diluted
earnings per share) for 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $149.6 million  ($1.64),  $128.6
million ($1.42) and $112.2 million ($1.28), respectively.

    The Company's 1997 operating income was $267.8 million, an increase of $44.5
million (19.9%) over 1996 operating  income of $223.3  million.  During 1997 the
operating  income of the  Company's  telephone and wireless  segments  increased
$18.1  million  (11.7%)  and  $20.2  million  (29.7%),  respectively,  while the
operating income of the Company's other operations  increased $6.2 million.  The
Company's operating income during 1995 was $202.9 million.

    The Company's  wireless  operations  reflect the  operations of the cellular
entities in which the Company has a majority ownership interest.  For additional
information concerning the minority interest owners' share of the income of such
entities and the Company's share of earnings from cellular  entities in which it
has less than a majority  interest,  see  Cellular  Operations  and Income  From
Unconsolidated Cellular Entities.

    Contributions  to operating  revenues and operating  income by the Company's
telephone,  wireless,  and  other  operations  for  each  of  the  years  in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1997 were as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As indicated by the chart  above,  the  percentage  of the  Company's  total
operating revenues and operating income  contributed by its wireless  operations
has  increased  over the  past few  years.  Immediately  prior to the  Company's
acquisition of PTI in December 1997, the Company's  ratio of owned cellular pops
(the  population  of  licensed  cellular  telephone  markets  multiplied  by the
Company's  proportionate  equity interests in the licensed operators thereof) to
telephone access lines was 15:1. As a result of the Company's acquisition of the
PTI properties,  the Company's ratio of owned cellular pops to telephone  access
lines has decreased to 8:1.

    In addition to historical information,  management's discussion and analysis
includes  certain  forward-  looking  statements  regarding events and financial
trends that may affect the  Company's  future  operating  results and  financial
position.  Such  forward-looking  statements are subject to  uncertainties  that
could  cause  the  Company's  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from such
statements.  Such  uncertainties  include but are not limited to: the effects of
ongoing deregulation in the  telecommunications  industry; the potential effects
of greater than  anticipated  competition  in the  Company's  markets;  possible
changes in the demand for the  Company's  products and  services;  the Company's
ability  to  successfully  introduce  new  product  offerings  on a  timely  and
cost-effective  basis;  the risks inherent in rapid  technological  change;  the
Company's ability to effectively  manage its growth,  including  integrating the
newly-acquired operations of PTI into the Company's operations;  and the effects
of more general factors such as changes in general market or economic conditions
or in legislation,  regulation or public policy.  These and other  uncertainties
related to the  Company's  business  are  described in detail in Item 1. You are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date on which they were made.  The  Company  undertakes  no
obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements for any reason.

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

    Prior to December 1997 the Company  conducted  its  telephone  operations in
rural, suburban and small urban communities in 14 states.  Subsequent to the PTI
acquisition on December 1, 1997, the Company  provides local exchange  telephone
service  in  similar  communities  in  21  states.  As  of  December  31,  1997,
approximately  85% of the  Company's  telephone  access lines were in Wisconsin,
Washington, Alaska, Michigan, Louisiana, Colorado, Ohio, Oregon and Montana. The
operating revenues,  expenses and income of the Company's  telephone  operations
for 1997, 1996 and 1995 are summarized below.

=============================================================================

Local Service Revenues

    Local  service  revenues  are derived from the  provision of local  exchange
telephone  services in the Company's  service areas.  The $25.9 million  (21.2%)
increase  in such  revenues  in 1997  included  $17.4  million  from  properties
acquired,  of which $15.0 million was from the PTI properties;  $5.6 million due
to the increase in the number of customer access lines;  and $2.8 million due to
the  provision  of  custom  calling  features.   An  increase  in  access  lines
contributed $6.2 million to the 1996 increase of $10.1 million;  $3.0 million of
the 1996 increase was due to the provision of custom calling features.  Internal
access  line  growth  during  1997,  1996  and  1995 was  4.4%,  4.3% and  4.4%,
respectively.

Network Access Revenues

    Network access revenues are primarily  derived from charges to long distance
companies and other customers for access to the Company's local exchange carrier
("LEC")  networks in connection  with the completion of long distance  telephone
calls.  These access  charges are based on tariffed  access rates filed with the
Federal  Communications  Commission ("FCC") for interstate services and with the
respective  state  regulatory  agency for  intrastate  services.  Certain of the
Company's  interstate  network access revenues are based on access charges filed
directly  with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue
sharing  arrangements  with other LECs  administered  by the  National  Exchange
Carrier  Association.  Intrastate  network  access  revenues are based on access
charges or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs.

    Network access  revenues  increased  $43.2 million (15.6%) in 1997 and $17.7
million (6.8%) in 1996 due to the following factors:

                                                          1997          1996

==============================================================================

    Included in "Other,  net" in 1997 and 1996 were  reductions  of $3.8 million
and  $1.7  million,  respectively,  in  access  revenues  due to the  previously
announced  reductions  in  intrastate  switched  access  rates  mandated  by the
Louisiana Public Service Commission ("LPSC") which were phased in from July 1995
through July 1997. As a result of the July 1997 rate  reduction  being in effect
for a full twelve  months  during  1998,  such access  revenues for 1998 will be
reduced approximately $1.8 million from 1997 levels. Included in "Other, net" in
1996 was  approximately  $2.3  million of revenue  increases  associated  with a
change in the methodology applied in the network access revenue billing process.

Other Revenues

    Other revenues include revenues related to (i) leasing, selling, installing,
maintaining  and repairing  customer  premise  telecommunications  equipment and
wiring ("CPE services"), (ii) providing billing and collection services for long
distance carriers,  (iii)  participating in the publication of local directories
and (iv) providing Internet access. The PTI properties  contributed $4.6 million
to the $10.0  million  increase  in other  revenues in 1997.  Exclusive  of PTI,
revenues  from CPE services  increased  $3.5  million;  $2.5 million of the 1997
increase was attributable to the provision of Internet access to a larger number
of customers.  Revenues  from CPE services and the provision of Internet  access
contributed  $3.2 million and $1.4  million,  respectively,  to the $4.5 million
increase in other revenues in 1996.  Billing and collection  revenues  decreased
$1.0 million and $606,000 in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Operating Expenses

    Plant  operations  expenses  during 1997 and 1996  increased  $20.1  million
(22.4%) and $3.3  million  (3.8%),  respectively.  Expenses  incurred by the PTI
properties  in December  1997 were $12.0  million.  Exclusive  of PTI,  expenses
incurred in  connection  with  providing  Internet  access to a larger number of
customers  contributed $3.5 million to the 1997 increase and other  acquisitions
accounted for $1.8 million of such increase.  Expenses incurred in the provision
of Internet access contributed approximately $2.2 million to the 1996 increase

    Customer operations,  corporate,  and other expenses increased $20.9 million
(18.9%) in 1997, of which $11.2 million was incurred by the PTI properties  and,
exclusive of PTI,  $1.7  million was due to an increase in  marketing  expenses.
Exclusive of PTI and marketing  expenses,  expenses incurred in the provision of
CPE services were up $1.4 million;  operating  taxes  increased  $1.6 million in
1997.  Marketing expenses  contributed $2.0 million to the 1996 increase of $7.9
million (7.7%) in customer operations,  corporate, and other expenses. Exclusive
of  marketing  expenses,  expenses  incurred in the  provision  of CPE  services
increased $1.9 million in 1996 and operating taxes increased $1.5 million.

    Depreciation  and  amortization  increased  $19.9  million  (20.8%) and $9.5
million (11.0%) in 1997 and 1996,  respectively.  Approximately $11.4 million of
the 1997 increase was  applicable to acquiring and operating  PTI, of which $1.5
million represented  amortization of goodwill. $1.7 million of the 1997 increase
was applicable to other  acquisitions.  Exclusive of acquisitions,  depreciation
expense  included  nonrecurring  additional  depreciation  charges  approved  by
regulators in certain  jurisdictions  which  aggregated $4.4 million in 1997 and
$8.2 million in 1996. In addition,  the Company obtained increased  depreciation
rates in certain  jurisdictions  which  increased  depreciation  expense by $4.4
million in 1997. The remaining  increases in  depreciation  and  amortization in
1997 and 1996  were due to  higher  levels of plant in  service.  The  composite
depreciation rate for the Company's  regulated telephone  properties,  including
the  additional  depreciation  charges,  was 7.4% for 1997 and 7.5% for 1996 and
1995.

Other

     The Company  anticipates that regulatory changes and competitive  pressures
may result in future revenue  reductions in its telephone  operations.  However,
the Company  anticipates  that such  reductions may be minimized by increases in
revenues  attributable  to the  continued  demand for enhanced  services and new
product offerings.  While the Company expects its telephone revenues to continue
to grow, its internal  telephone  revenue  growth rate may slow during  upcoming
periods.

may impact the Company's telephone operations, see Regulation and Competition.

Operating Revenues

    Cellular  service revenues include monthly service fees for providing access
and airtime to customers,  service fees for providing airtime to other carriers'
customers  roaming  through  the  Company's  service  areas,  and toll  revenue.
Cellular  service  revenues  during 1997 increased to $302.2 million from $246.0
million in 1996 and $192.0 million in 1995.

    The 1997 and 1996  increases in cellular  service  revenues  were  primarily
attributable to the increases in cellular  customers due to increased demand for
wireless services and  acquisitions.  Cellular units in service in the Company's
majority-owned markets increased to 569,983 as of December 31, 1997 from 368,233
as of December  31, 1996 and 290,075 as of December  31,  1995.  Included in the
1997 and 1996  increases  were 123,600 and 4,850,  respectively,  of units added
through  acquisitions,  including  88,245  acquired  in the PTI  acquisition  in
December 1997.  Exclusive of acquisitions,  access and usage revenues  increased
$29.6 million  (16.9%) in 1997 and $33.9 million (25.6%) in 1996 and roaming and
toll revenues  increased $16.6 million (25.1%) and $11.8 million (24.2%) in 1997
and 1996, respectively.  Acquisitions contributed $11.8 million and $7.8 million
to the increase in cellular service revenues in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

    The average monthly cellular service revenue per customer declined to $61 in
1997 from $63 in 1996 and $66 in 1995. It has been an  industry-wide  trend that
early  subscribers  have  normally  been the  heaviest  users  and that a higher
percentage  of new  subscribers  tend to be lower usage  customers.  The average
monthly  service revenue per customer is expected to decline in 1998 as a result
of the PTI acquisition (due to PTI's  historically lower average monthly service
revenue  per  customer)  and  may  further  decline  (i) as  market  penetration
increases  and  additional  lower  usage  customers  are  activated  and (ii) as
competitive pressures from current and future wireless communications  providers
intensify.  The Company is  responding to such  competitive  pressures by, among
other  things,  modifying  certain of its price plans and  implementing  certain
other plans and  promotions,  all of which are likely to result in lower average
revenue per customer. The Company will continue to focus on customer service and
attempt to stimulate  cellular  usage by promoting the  availability  of certain
enhanced  services  and by  improving  the  quality of its  service  through the
construction of additional cell sites and other enhancements to its system.

Operating Expenses

    The $11.3 million  (31.0%)  increase in system  operations  expenses in 1997
included a $4.7  million  increase in the  amounts  paid to other  carriers  for
cellular  service  provided  to the  Company's  customers  who roam in the other
carriers'  service  areas (net of the amounts the  Company  bills its  customers
therefor),  and a $974,000 increase in expenses  associated with cellular fraud.
Expenses incurred by properties acquired were $2.8 million. The remainder of the
increase in system  operations  expenses  in 1997  resulted  primarily  from the
operation of more cell sites.

    The Company operated 558 cell sites at December 31,1997 in entities in which
it had a majority  interest,  compared  to 354 at  December  31, 1996 and 277 at
December  31,  1995.  In 1997 and 1996,  155 cell  sites and eight  cell  sites,
respectively, were added through acquisitions.

    System operations expenses increased $10.4 million (40.1%) in 1996 primarily
due to a $4.0  million  increase  in the  amounts  paid to  other  carriers  for
cellular  service  provided  to the  Company's  customers  who roam in the other
carriers'  service  areas (net of the amounts the  Company  bills its  customers
therefor),  and a $1.8 million  increase in expenses  associated  with  cellular
fraud.  The  remainder  of the  increase in system  operations  expenses in 1996
resulted primarily from the operation of new cell sites.

    Approximately  $3.0 million of the $9.4 million (17.7%) increase in general,
administrative   and  customer  service  expenses  in  1997  was  applicable  to
operations  acquired.  Most of the remainder of the 1997 increase was related to
increased expenses  resulting from a larger customer base.  Customer service and
retention  costs  increased  $2.4  million and billing  costs were $2.4  million
higher.  Of the $13.4 million (34.0%)  increase in general,  administrative  and
customer  service  expenses  in 1996,  $5.5  million  was due to an  increase in
customer service and retention costs; $2.2 million was due to an increase in the
provision for doubtful accounts;  $1.3 million was due to an increase in billing
costs; and $3.9 million was due to increased general office expenses.

    Churn rate (the percentage of cellular  customers that terminate service) is
an industry-wide  concern.  The Company faces  substantial  competition from the
other  cellular  provider  in  certain  of its  markets  and has  begun  to face
competition from PCS providers in a few of its markets. A significant portion of
the churn in the Company's cellular markets is due to the Company  disconnecting
service to customers for  nonpayment.  The Company's  average monthly churn rate
was 2.31% in 1997 and 2.37% in 1996.

    During 1997 and 1996,  sales and marketing  expenses  increased $7.3 million
(15.7%) and $7.3 million  (18.6%),  respectively.  The 1997 increase  included a
$4.9  million  increase in costs  incurred in selling  products  and services in
retail locations,  including Company-owned stores. Approximately $2.8 million of
the 1997  increase was  applicable to operations  acquired.  Approximately  $3.7
million of the 1996  increase  was due to an increase in  advertising  and sales
promotion  expenses.  The 1996 increase also included a $2.8 million increase in
costs of operating retail locations.

    Depreciation  and  amortization  increased $7.6 million  (22.5%) in 1997 and
$8.1 million (32.0%) in 1996 due primarily to higher levels of plant in service.
In 1997 and 1996, $2.1 million and $1.7 million,  respectively,  of the increase
was applicable to operations acquired.

may impact the Company's wireless operations, see Regulation and Competition.

OTHER OPERATIONS

    Other  operations  include the results of operations of  subsidiaries of the
Company which are not included in the telephone or wireless segments  including,
but not limited to, the Company's  competitive access subsidiary (which was sold
to Brooks in May 1997) and the  Company's  non-regulated  long distance and call
center operations. The operating revenues,  expenses and income of the Company's
other operations for 1997, 1996 and 1995 are summarized below.

============================================================================

    Of the $15.3 million (31.9%)  increase in operating  revenues in 1997, $13.1
million was  applicable  to the long  distance  and call center  operations.  An
increase in operating  expenses of $11.7  million  incurred by the long distance
and call center  operations in 1997 was  partially  offset by a decrease of $4.1
million in  operating  expenses  incurred by the  Company's  competitive  access
subsidiary. The operating loss of the Company's competitive access subsidiary in
1997 (prior to its sale) was $2.4 million compared to $6.2 million in 1996.

    In 1996, $15.6 million of the $19.8 million  increase in operating  revenues
was due to the long  distance and call center  operations.  Of the $22.0 million
increase in operating  expenses in 1996,  $13.8 million was incurred by the long
distance  and call center  operations  and $4.7  million was  applicable  to the
Company's competitive access subsidiary.

    Certain  of  the  Company's   service   subsidiaries   provide   managerial,
operational,  technical  and  accounting  services,  along  with  materials  and
supplies,  to  the  Company's  telephone   subsidiaries.   In  accor-dance  with
regulatory  accounting,  intercompany  profit  on  transactions  with  regulated
affiliates has not been eliminated in connection with  consolidating the results
of  operations of the Company.  When the regulated  operations of the Company no
longer  qualify  for  the  application  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 71 ("SFAS 71"),  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation," such intercompany profit will be eliminated in subsequent financial
statements, the primary result of which will be a decrease in operating expenses
applicable to the Company's  telephone  operations  and an increase in operating
expenses  applicable to the Company's other  operations  segment.  The amount of
intercompany  profit with  regulated  affiliates  which was not  eliminated  was
approximately  $8.9  million,  $7.7 million and $8.0  million in 1997,  1996 and
1995,  respectively.  For  additional  information  applicable  to SFAS 71,  see
Regulation and Competition - Other Matters.

INTEREST EXPENSE

    Interest expense  increased $11.8 million (26.4%) in 1997,  primarily due to
$7.2  million  of  interest  expense  on the  borrowings  used to  fund  the PTI
acquisition and $3.5 million of interest expense applicable to PTI's debt.

    For additional information,  see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing
Activities and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED CELLULAR ENTITIES

    Earnings from unconsolidated  cellular entities,  net of the amortization of
associated  goodwill,  increased  $842,000  (3.1%)  during 1997 and $6.9 million
(34.2%) during 1996. The  improvement  in  profitability  in 1997 of most of the
cellular  entities in which the Company  owns less than a majority  interest was
substantially  offset by a $2.4 million decrease in the Company's portion of the
profits  of a  partnership  in which the  Company  has a  significant  ownership
interest.

GAIN ON SALES OF ASSETS

    During  1997  the  Company  sold  its   majority-owned   competitive  access
subsidiary to Brooks in exchange for approximately 4.3 million shares of Brooks'
common stock.  The Company recorded a pre-tax gain in the second quarter of 1997
of approximately $71 million ($46 million after-tax; $.50 per diluted share). In
November  1997,  the Company sold  approximately  3.8 million  shares of Brooks'
stock and  recorded a pre-tax  gain of  approximately  $108 million ($66 million
after-tax; $.73 per diluted share).

MINORITY INTEREST

    Minority  interest  is the  expense  recorded  by the Company to reflect the
minority interest owners' share of the earnings of the Company's  majority-owned
and operated cellular  entities and  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  Decreases in
minority  interest of $1.2  million in 1997 and $1.4 million in 1996 were due to
the effect of the Company's  acquisition,  during the second quarter of 1996, of
an additional 25% interest in a Louisiana  cellular  partnership which decreased
the minority interest owners' share of such partnership.  In addition,  minority
interest  decreased  $756,000  during 1997 as a result of  allocating  thereto a
portion  of  the  loss  of  the  Company's  majority-owned   competitive  access
subsidiary to the minority shareholders. In 1996, no portion of the loss of such
subsidiary was allocated to minority interest. Such decreases were substantially
offset by increased minority interest expense due to increased  profitability of
the Company's majority-owned and operated cellular entities.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

    Other  income and  expense  during  1997 was $5.1  million  compared to $3.9
million during 1996 and $5.0 million in 1995. The first quarter of 1996 included
a nonrecurring charge of $1.1 million which related to the Company's  withdrawal
of its investment in an entity formed to bid on Personal Communications Services
("PCS") licenses after such entity withdrew from the federal auction in 1996.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

    The Company's  effective income tax rate was 37.3%, 36.6% and 37.3% in 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively. For additional information, see Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

MAJOR ACQUISITION

    On December 1, 1997, the Company acquired PTI in exchange for $1.503 billion
cash. To finance the acquisition,  the Company borrowed $1.288 billion under its
$1.6 billion senior unsecured  credit facility with  NationsBank of Texas,  N.A.
and a syndicate  of other  lenders.  This debt matures in five years and carries
floating-rate  interest based upon London InterBank Offered Rates for short-term
periods.  As of December 31, 1997,  the weighted  average  interest rate of this
debt was 6.17%. The Company paid the remainder of the PTI acquisition price with
available  cash,  most of which consisted of the proceeds of the sale of Brooks'
common stock in November  1997. As indicated  below under  Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Financing Activities,  the Company repaid approximately $758 million
of this acquisition  indebtedness  with the net proceeds of a public offering of
senior  debt  securities  in January  1998.As a result of the  acquisition,  the
Company  acquired  (i) over  660,000  telephone  access  lines  located  in four
midwestern  states,  seven western states and Alaska,  (ii) over 88,000 cellular
subscribers  in two  midwestern  states and Alaska and (iii)  various  wireless,
cable television and other  communications  assets. For additional  information,
see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In December  1997 the Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 128 ("SFAS  128"),  "Earnings  per Share."  SFAS 128  established
requirements  for the  computation  of basic  earnings  per  share  and  diluted
earnings per share. The Company  previously  reported primary earnings per share
of $1.43 and $1.31 for 1996 and 1995,  respectively,  and fully diluted earnings
per share of $1.43 and $1.30 for 1996 and 1995, respectively, in accordance with
the  provisions of  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 15,  "Earnings per
Share."

INFLATION

    The effects of  increased  costs  historically  have been  mitigated  by the
ability to recover certain costs applicable to the Company's regulated telephone
operations  through  the  rate-making  process.  As  operating  expenses  in the
Company's nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation,  the
Company,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  competition,  recovers  the  costs  by
increasing prices for its services and equipment.  While the rate-making process
does not permit the Company to  immediately  recover the costs of replacing  its
physical plant, the Company has historically  been able to recapture these costs
over time. Possible future regulatory changes may alter the Company's ability to
recover increased costs in its regulated operations.  For additional information
regarding the current regulatory environment, see Regulation and Competition.

YEAR 2000

    The Company  believes that it has  identified  each of its computer  systems
that will require  modifications to enable it to perform  satisfactorily  on and
after January 1, 2000. The financial impact of making such  modifications to the
Company's  systems is not expected to be material to the Company's  consolidated
financial  position  or results  of  operations.  In  addition,  the  Company is
currently  corresponding  with vendors that provide  products and systems to the
Company in order to determine if such products or systems will be required to be
upgraded or replaced.  Although  management believes the Company has an adequate
program in place to address  the year 2000 issue,  the costs of upgrades  to, or
replacements  of, its purchased  products or systems has not been determined and
there can be no assurance that the program will ultimately be successful.

                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    Excluding cash used for acquisitions, the Company relies on cash provided by
operations  to provide a  substantial  portion of its cash needs.  The Company's
operations  have  historically  provided a stable  source of cash flow which has
helped the Company continue its long-term program of capital improvements.

Operating Activities

    Net cash provided by operating activities was $297.3 million, $264.7 million
and  $215.7  million  in  1997,  1996  and  1995,  respectively.  The  Company's
accompanying  consolidated  statements of cash flows identify major  differences
between net income and net cash  provided by  operating  activities  for each of
those years. For additional  information  relating to the telephone  operations,
wireless  operations,  and other  operations  of the  Company,  see  Results  of
Operations.

Investing Activities

    Net cash used in investing activities was $1.503 billion, $241.8 million and
$227.8 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Cash used for acquisitions
was $1.544  billion  during  1997,  compared to $46.3  million in 1996 and $22.1
million in 1995.  See Results of Operations - Major  Acquisition  for additional
information.  Capital  expenditures  for 1997 were $115.9  million for telephone
operations,  $39.1  million  for  wireless  operations  and  $26.3  million  for
corporate and other operations.  Capital  expenditures during 1996 and 1995 were
$222.9  million  and $196.6  million,  respectively.  Proceeds  from the sale of
Brooks' common stock were $202.7 million in 1997. The $241.8 million of net cash
used in  investing  activities  in 1996  was net of the  reimbursement  of $18.9
million  related to the  Company's  withdrawal  of its equity  investment  in an
entity formed for the purpose of  participating  in the FCC auction of 30MHz PCS
licenses.

Financing Activities

    Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.223 billion during 1997, of
which  $1.288  billion was  related to the  acquisition  of PTI.  See Results of
Operations - Major  Acquisition  for  additional  information.  Net cash used in
financing  activities  was $23.0  million  during 1996 and net cash  provided by
financing  activities  was $13.5  million  during  1995.  Exclusive  of  amounts
borrowed to fund the PTI  acquisition,  net payments of debt were $54.7  million
during 1997 compared to $11.6 million  during 1996. In November 1995 the Company
issued $150 million of senior notes under its $400  million  shelf  registration
statement.  The net proceeds were used to reduce the Company's  borrowings under
its credit facilities.

    In  December  1997,  after  giving  consideration  to the  PTI  acquisition,
Standard & Poor's assigned  Century's senior unsecured debt a rating of BBB+ and
Moody's reaffirmed its rating of Baa1.

    In December 1997 the Company filed a shelf  registration  statement with the
United States  Securities and Exchange  Commission  registering  $1.5 billion of
senior  unsecured debt securities,  preferred stock,  common stock and warrants,
under which the Company issued $665 million of senior debt securities in January
1998  concurrent  with the issuance of the remaining $100 million under its $400
million shelf  registration  statement.  The net proceeds of approximately  $758
million (excluding  payment  obligations of approximately $39 million related to
interest  rate hedging  effected in connection  with the offering)  were used to
reduce the bank acquisition  indebtedness  incurred by the Company in connection
with its December  1997  acquisition  of PTI. The Company's  effective  weighted
average cost of funds for its $765 million debt issuance is 7.15%,  after giving
consideration to the payment obligations mentioned above.

Other

    Budgeted  capital  expenditures  for 1998 total $220  million for  telephone
operations,  $90 million for wireless  operations  and $40 million for corporate
and other operations.  The Company anticipates that capital  expenditures in its
telephone  operations  will continue to include the  installation of fiber optic
cable and the  upgrading  of its  plant and  equipment,  including  its  digital
switches,  to provide enhanced  services.  Capital  expenditures in the wireless
operations  are expected to continue to focus on  constructing  additional  cell
sites (which will provide additional capacity and expanded areas where hand-held
cellular phones may be used) and providing digital service.

    In early 1997 the Company was awarded 12 PCS licenses in connection with the
FCC's D and E block  auctions of 10MHz PCS  licenses.  The licenses  cover areas
with a population of approximately four million; the Company's investment in the
licenses  was $4.6  million.  As a result of the PTI  acquisition,  the  Company
acquired PCS licenses  that cover areas with a population of  approximately  4.1
million.  Approximately $20 million of the 1998 capital  expenditure  budget for
corporate and other operations is for development of the Company's PCS networks.

    The Company will continue its long-term strategy of pursuing the acquisition
of  attractive  communications  properties  in exchange for cash,  securities or
both,   and  may  require   additional   financing  in   connection   therewith.
Approximately  2.7 million  shares of Century common stock and 200,000 shares of
Century  preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with
acquisitions under an acquisition shelf registration statement.

    As of December 31, 1997, the Company's telephone  subsidiaries had available
for use $140.9  million of  commitments  for long-term  financing from the Rural
Utilities  Service and the Company had $351.1 million of undrawn  committed bank
lines of credit. The Company also has access to debt and equity capital markets,
including its shelf registration statements mentioned above.

    Common  stockholders'  equity as a percentage  of total  capitalization  was
32.6% and 60.8% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  As of November 30,
1997 (immediately prior to the PTI acquisition),  common stockholders' equity as
a percentage of total capitalization was 68.5%.


                           REGULATION AND COMPETITION

    The  communications   industry  continues  to  undergo  various  fundamental
regulatory,  competitive  and  technological  changes  that make it difficult to
determine the form or degree of future regulation and competition  affecting the
Company's  telephone  and  wireless   operations.   These  changes  may  have  a
significant  impact on the future  financial  performance of all  communications
companies.

Events Affecting the Communications Industry

    In February 1996 the United States Congress  enacted the  Telecommunications
Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"),  which  obligates  LECs to permit  competitors  to
interconnect  their  facilities  to the LEC's  network and to take various other
steps that are designed to promote  competition.  Although the 1996 Act provides
certain  exemptions  for rural LECs such as those  operated by the Company,  the
FCC's  August  1996 order  implementing  most of the 1996 Act's  interconnection
provisions  placed the burden of proving the  continuing  availability  of these
exemptions on rural LECs. In July 1997 the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit overturned  several provisions of the FCC's August 1996  interconnection
order,  including  the rules placing the burden of proof on rural LECs to retain
their rural  exemption.  This  decision has been  appealed to the United  States
Supreme Court.

    Prior to and since the  enactment  of the 1996 Act,  the FCC and a number of
state  legislative  and  regulatory  bodies  have  taken  steps to foster  local
exchange  competition.  Coincident with this recent  movement  toward  increased
competition  has been the gradual  reduction  of  regulatory  oversight of LECs.
These cumulative  changes have led to the continued growth of various  companies
providing services that compete with LECs' services.  Wireless services are also
expected to increasingly compete with LECs.

    The 1996 Act authorized  the  establishment  of federal and state  universal
service funds to provide support to eligible telecommunications carriers. In May
1997 the FCC adopted an order on universal service, as mandated by the 1996 Act.
In the order, the FCC ruled that rural telephone  companies which are designated
eligible  telecommunications carriers will continue to receive universal service
funding.  Each of the Company's  LECs has been so  designated by its  respective
state  regulatory  agency.  As a result,  the  Company's  LECs will  continue to
receive payments under the federal support mechanisms  currently in effect until
the FCC adopts funding  support  mechanisms  based on  forward-looking  economic
costs, which it is required to do, but no earlier than January 2001.

    As part of its  universal  service  order,  the FCC also  established  a new
program to provide up to $2.25 billion of discounted telecommunications services
annually to schools and libraries, commencing January 1998. In addition, the FCC
established a $400 million annual fund to provide discounted telecom-munications
services for rural health care providers.  All communications carriers providing
interstate  telecommunications  services,  including the Company's  LECs and its
cellular  and long  distance  operations,  are required to  contribute  to these
programs.  In December  1997 the FCC,  while  reserving the right to adjust such
amounts if demand  increases,  modified the amounts to be  collected  during the
first six months of 1998 to no more than $625 million for schools and  libraries
and no more than $50 million for rural health care providers. The FCC has stated
that local exchange telephone companies will recover their funding contributions
in their rates for interstate services. The Company currently estimates that the
contribution  by its  cellular  and  long  distance  operations  for  1998  will
approximate $3.5 million.

    In an access charge  reform order  adopted in May 1997,  the FCC changed its
system  of  interstate   access  charges  to  make  them   compatible  with  the
deregulatory  framework  established by the 1996 Act. Such changes are primarily
applicable  to  price-cap  companies.   The  Company's  telephone   subsidiaries
determine   interstate  revenues  under  rate  of  return  regulation  and  are,
therefore,  only minimally  impacted by the access charge reform order.  The FCC
stated that a separate  access charge reform  proceeding  would be initiated for
rate of return companies.

    Numerous petitions for reconsideration or clarification have been filed with
the FCC  regarding  the  universal  service  and  access  charge  reform  orders
discussed above.

    In October 1997 the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking which would,
among other things,  create a federal-state joint board to review jurisdictional
separations  procedures through which the costs of regulated  telecommunications
services are allocated to the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions.

    In recent years,  the FCC has allocated  additional  frequency  spectrum for
wireless  technologies  that compete or are  expected to compete with  cellular,
including  PCS and  mobile  satellite  services.  Recently,  several  major  PCS
companies began providing services  competitive with cellular in selected larger
markets,  although  thus far the Company has  experienced  competition  from PCS
companies  in only a few of its  markets.  The FCC has also  authorized  certain
specialized  mobile radio service  licensees to configure their systems so as to
operate in a manner similar to cellular systems.

    In  February  1996 the FCC  sought  public  comments  on  whether  it should
initiate a rate of return represcription proceeding for LECs that are subject to
rate of return regulation for interstate access revenues. The Company is unaware
of any significant developments in this proceeding.

    Competition  to  provide  traditional  telephone  or  wireless  services  is
expected to initially  affect large urban areas to a greater  extent than rural,
suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the  Company's  operations
are  located.  The  Company  does not  believe  such  competition  is  likely to
materially  affect it in the near term. The Company further believes that it may
benefit from having the opportunity to observe the effects of these developments
in large urban markets.  The Company will continue to monitor ongoing changes in
regulation,  competition and technology and consider which developments  provide
the most favorable opportunities for the Company to pursue.

Recent Events Affecting the Company

    As mentioned above in Events Affecting the Communications  Industry,  in May
1997 the FCC adopted an order on universal  service.  During 1997 the  Company's
revenues  from the USF  increased  approximately  $16.1  million  (of which $4.6
million was applicable to the PTI properties) to $65.4 million after  increasing
$7.5  million  during  1996.  Although  the  Company  anticipates  that  it  may
experience  a  reduction  in its federal  support  revenues at some point in the
future,  management  believes it is premature to assess or estimate the ultimate
impact thereof. There can be no assurance, however, that such impact will not be
material.

    During  the  last  few  years,  several  states  in which  the  Company  has
substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce
competition  into the LEC  business.  While the  Company  is aware of only a few
companies which have requested  authorization  to provide local exchange service
in the Company's  service areas,  it is  anticipated  that similar action may be
taken by others in the future.

    In June 1997 the LPSC adopted a Consumer Price Protection Plan (the "Plan"),
effective July 1997, which impacts all of the Company's  telephone  subsidiaries
operating in Louisiana. The new form of regulation will focus primarily on price
and  quality of  service.  Under the Plan,  the  Company's  Louisiana  telephone
subsidiaries'  local rates will be frozen for a period of three years and access
rates  will be  frozen  for a  period  of two  years.  Although  the Plan has no
specified  term,  the LPSC is required to review it by mid-2000.  The  Company's
Louisiana  telephone  subsidiaries  have the option to propose a new plan at any
time if the  LPSC  determines  that (i)  effective  competition  exists  or (ii)
unforeseen events threaten the subsidiary's  ability to provide adequate service
or impair its financial health.

    During 1995 the LPSC adopted a  regulatory  plan for  independent  telephone
companies in  Louisiana.  Under this plan,  the Company's  access  revenues were
reduced  $3.8  million  in 1997  and  $1.7  million  in  1996,  and the  Company
anticipates  that its access revenues will be further  reduced by  approximately
$1.8  million  in 1998.  See  Results of  Operations  Telephone  Operations  for
additional information.

    Certain long distance  carriers  continue to request that the Company reduce
intrastate  access  tariffed  rates for certain of its  telephone  subsidiaries.
There is no assurance that these requests will not result in reduced  intrastate
access revenues in the future.

Other Matters

    The Company's regulated  telephone  operations are subject to the provisions
of SFAS 71,  under which the  Company is  required  to account for the  economic
effects of the rate-making process, including the recognition of depreciation of
plant and equipment over lives approved by regulators. The ongoing applicability
of SFAS 71 to the Company's  regulated  telephone  operations is being monitored
due to the changing regulatory,  competitive and legislative environments.  When
the regulated operations of the Company no longer qualify for the application of
SFAS 71, the net adjustments required will result in a material,  extraordinary,
noncash  charge  against  earnings.  While the amount of such  charge  cannot be
precisely  estimated  at  this  time,  management  believes  that  the  noncash,
after-tax,  extraordinary charge would be between $250 million and $300 million.
See  Note 11 of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional
information.

    The Company has certain  obligations based on federal,  state and local laws
relating to the protection of the environment.  Costs of compliance through 1997
have not been material,  and the Company currently has no reason to believe that
such costs will become material.

                       CENTURY TELEPHONE ENTERPRISES, INC.
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                                December 31, 1997


(1)    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation - The consolidated  financial  statements of Century
Telephone  Enterprises,  Inc. and its subsidiaries  (the "Company")  include the
accounts  of  Century   Telephone   Enterprises,   Inc.   ("Century")   and  its
majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships.  The Company's regulated telephone
operations  are subject to the  provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 71,  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."
Investments  in  cellular  entities  where the  Company  does not own a majority
interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Revenue  recognition  - Revenues  are  recognized  when  earned.  Certain of the
Company's  telephone  subsidiaries  participate in revenue sharing  arrangements
with other telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate
revenue.  Such sharing  arrangements  are funded by toll revenue  and/or  access
charges  within  state  jurisdictions  and by access  charges in the  interstate
market.  Revenues earned through the various sharing  arrangements are initially
recorded based on the Company's estimates.

Property, plant  and  equipment - Telephone  plant is  stated  substantially  at
original cost of  construction.  Normal  retirements  of telephone  property are
charged against accumulated depreciation,  along with the costs of removal, less
salvage, with no gain or loss recognized.  Renewals and betterments of plant and
equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are
charged to operating expense.  Depreciation of telephone  properties is provided
on the straight line method,  using class or overall  group rates  acceptable to
the regulatory authorities; such rates range from 1.8% to 25%.

   Non-telephone property is stated at cost and, when sold or retired, a gain or
loss is  recognized.  Depreciation  of such property is provided on the straight
line method over estimated service lives ranging from three to 30 years.

Impairment of long-lived  assets  and  excess  cost  of  net  assets  acquired
(goodwill) - In 1996 the Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 121 ("SFAS  121"),  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets  and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be  Disposed  Of."  SFAS 121  established
accounting   standards  for  the  impairment  of  long-lived   assets,   certain
identifiable  intangibles,  and goodwill  related to those assets to be held and
used,  and for  long-lived  assets and certain  identifiable  intangibles  to be
disposed  of. The  carrying  value of  long-lived  assets,  including  allocated
goodwill,  is reviewed for impairment at least  annually,  or whenever events or
changes  in  circumstances   indicate  that  such  carrying  value  may  not  be
recoverable,  by assessing the  recoverability  of such  carrying  value through
estimated  undiscounted  future net cash flows  expected to be  generated by the
assets or the  acquired  business.  The  adoption of SFAS 121 did not affect the
Company's consolidated  financial position or results of operations.  The excess
cost of net assets acquired of substantially  all of the Company's  acquisitions
accounted for as purchases is being amortized over forty years.

Affiliated  transactions  - Certain  service  subsidiaries  of  Century  provide
installation and maintenance services,  materials and supplies,  and managerial,
technical and accounting services to subsidiaries. In addition, Century provides
and bills  management  services to subsidiaries  and in certain  instances makes
interest  bearing  advances to finance  construction  of plant and  purchases of
equipment.   These   transactions  are  recorded  by  the  Company's   telephone
subsidiaries  at their cost to the extent  permitted by regulatory  authorities.
Intercompany  profit on transactions  with regulated  affiliates is limited to a
reasonable  return on investment and has not been  eliminated in connection with
consolidating  the  results  of  operations  of  Century  and its  subsidiaries.
Intercompany  profit  on  transactions  with  nonregulated  affiliates  has been
eliminated.

Income taxes - Century files a  consolidated  federal income tax return with its
eligible  subsidiaries.  The  Company  uses the  asset and  liability  method of
accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and  liabilities are
established for the future tax consequences  attributable to differences between
the financial  statement  carrying  amounts of assets and  liabilities and their
respective  tax bases.  Investment tax credits  related to telephone  plant have
been  deferred  and are being  amortized  as a reduction  of federal  income tax
expense  over the  estimated  useful  lives  of the  assets  giving  rise to the
credits.

Derivative  financial  instruments - Beginning in late 1997, the Company entered
into certain  interest  rate hedge  contracts in  anticipation  of a public debt
issuance,  utilizing such hedge contracts to manage interest rate exposure.  The
hedge contracts are treated as off-balance  sheet financial  instruments.  Gains
and losses  related  to hedges of  anticipated  transactions  are  deferred  and
amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt issuance. The
Company does not utilize derivative  financial  instruments for trading or other
speculative purposes.

Earnings  per share - During 1997 the Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 128 ("SFAS  128"),  "Earnings  per  Share."  SFAS 128
established  requirements  for the  computation  of basic earnings per share and
diluted earnings per share and was effective for financial statements issued for
periods  ending after  December 15, 1997.  Earnings per share  amounts for prior
periods have been restated to conform with SFAS 128.

Stock  compensation  - During 1996 the Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting   Standards  No.  123  ("SFAS  123"),   "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation."  As allowed by SFAS 123, the Company  accounts for employee stock
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25,  "Accounting for Stock Issued to  Employees."

Cash equivalents - The Company considers short-term  investments with a maturity
at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Reclassifications  - Certain  amounts  previously  reported for prior years have
been reclassified to conform with the 1997 presentation.

(2)   MAJOR ACQUISITION

     On December 1, 1997,  Century  acquired  Pacific  Telecom,  Inc. ("PTI") in
exchange  for  $1.503  billion  cash.  To  finance  the  acquisition,  which was
accounted  for as a purchase,  Century  borrowed  $1.288  billion under its $1.6
billion senior  unsecured credit facility dated August 28, 1997 with NationsBank
of Texas, N.A. and a syndicate of other lenders. This debt matures in five years
and carries floating-rate interest based upon London InterBank Offered Rates for
short-term  periods.  The  weighted  average  interest  rate of this  debt as of
December 31, 1997 was 6.17%.  Century paid the remainder of the PTI  acquisition
price with available cash.

    As a result of the  acquisition,  the Company  acquired (i) telephone access
lines located in four midwestern states,  seven western states and Alaska,  (ii)
cellular  subscribers  in two  midwestern  states and  Alaska and (iii)  various
wireless, cable television and other communications assets.

    The purchase  price will be allocated to the assets and  liabilities  of PTI
based on their  estimated  fair value.  As of December 31,  1997, a  preliminary
allocation of the purchase price was made.  Such  allocation will be refined and
finalized, primarily as it relates to noncurrent assets and liabilities,  during
1998.

    The following pro forma information  represents the consolidated  results of
operations of the Company as if the PTI acquisition  had been  consummated as of
January 1, 1997 and 1996.

    The pro forma  information  is not  necessarily  indicative of the operating
results that would have occurred if the PTI acquisition had been  consummated as
of January 1 of each  respective  period,  nor is it  necessarily  indicative of
future operating  results.  The actual results of operations of PTI are included
in the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  only  from  the  date of
acquisition.

    Net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 1997 and 1996 was composed

revolving  credit facility (the "Senior Credit  Facility")  with  NationsBank of
Texas,  N.A. and a syndicate of other lenders.  Such Senior Credit  Facility was
initially  utilized to finance a  substantial  portion of the purchase  price of
PTI. See Note 2 for  additional  information.  At December 31, 1997,  the Senior
Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $1.535 billion.  This debt matures
in five years and carries  floating-rate  interest  based upon London  InterBank
Offered Rates for short-term periods.

    In December 1997 the Company filed a shelf  registration  statement with the
United States  Securities and Exchange  Commission  registering  $1.5 billion of
senior  unsecured debt securities,  preferred stock,  common stock and warrants,
under which the Company  issued  $665.0  million of senior  debt  securities  in
January 1998. The Company  concurrently  issued the remaining  $100.0 million of
senior debt securities under its prior shelf registration statement. See Note 20

    For calculation purposes,  the ultimate health care cost rate was assumed to
range from 4.5% to 6%. If the assumed  health care cost rate had been  increased
by one percentage  point in each year, the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1997 would have increased $9.0 million and the net
periodic  postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 1997 would
have increased $483,000.  The postretirement  benefit plan assumed in connection
with the PTI  acquisition  had plan assets of $34.6  million as of December  31,
1997.

    The  discount  rates  used in  determining  the  accumulated  postretirement
benefit  obligation  as of  December  31,  1997 and 1996  were  7.0% and  7.75%,
respectively.

=============================================================================

    Under  Century's  Articles  of  Incorporation  each  share of  common  stock
beneficially  owned continuously by the same person since May 30, 1987 generally
entitles the holder thereof to ten votes per share. All other shares entitle the
holder to one vote per share.  At December 31, 1997, the holders of 11.6 million
shares of common  stock were  entitled  to ten votes per share.  See Note 20 for
additional information concerning a stock split in early 1998.

Preferred  stock - As of December  31, 1997,  Century had 2.0 million  shares of
preferred stock, $25 par value per share,  authorized.  At December 31, 1997 and
1996,  there were  324,238  and 401,629  shares,  respectively,  of  outstanding
preferred stock.  Holders of outstanding Century preferred stock are entitled to
receive cumulative  dividends,  receive preferential  distributions equal to $25
per share plus unpaid dividends upon Century's  liquidation and vote as a single
class with the holders of common stock.

Shareholders'  Rights Plan - In 1996 the Board of Directors  declared a dividend
of one preference share purchase right for each common share  outstanding.  Such
rights become  exercisable if and when a potential  acquiror takes certain steps
to acquire 15% or more of Century's common stock. Upon the occurrence of such an
acquisition,  each right held by  shareholders  other than the  acquiror  may be
exercised to receive  that number of shares of common stock or other  securities
of Century (or, in certain situations,  the acquiring company) which at the time
of such  transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of
the right.

(11)   ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF REGULATION

    The Company's regulated  telephone  operations are subject to the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 71 ("SFAS 71"),  "Accounting
for the Effects of Certain  Types of  Regulation."  Actions of a  regulator  can
provide reasonable  assurance of the existence of an asset,  reduce or eliminate
the value of an asset and impose a  liability  on a regulated  enterprise.  Such
regulatory assets and liabilities are required to be recorded and,  accordingly,
reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71.

    The  Company's  consolidated  balance sheet as of December 31, 1997 included
regulatory  assets of approximately  $7.0 million and regulatory  liabilities of
approximately $22.9 million exclusive of (i) property, plant and equipment, (ii)
accumulated depreciation and (iii) deferred income taxes and deferred investment
tax credits associated with regulatory assets and liabilities.  The $7.0 million
of  regulatory   assets   included   assets   established  in  connection   with
postretirement benefits ($1.4 million), income taxes ($2.6 million) and deferred
financing costs ($2.8 million).  The $22.9 million of regulatory liabilities was
established in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting For Income Taxes." Net deferred income tax assets
related to the  regulatory  assets and  liabilities  quantified  above were $5.5
million.

    Property,   plant  and  equipment  of  the  Company's   regulated  telephone
operations has been  depreciated  using  generally the straight line method over
lives approved by regulators. Such depreciable lives have generally exceeded the
depreciable lives used by nonregulated entities. In addition, in accordance with
regulatory  accounting,  retirements of regulated  telephone  property have been
charged  to  accumulated  depreciation,  along with the costs of  removal,  less
salvage,  with no  gain  or loss  recognized.  These  accounting  policies  have
resulted  in  accumulated  depreciation  being  significantly  less  than if the
Company's telephone operations had not been regulated.

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101 ("SFAS 101"), "Regulated
Enterprises - Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement
No. 71," specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the
criteria for  application  of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the  elimination of the
effects of any actions of  regulators  that have been  recognized  as assets and
liabilities  in  accordance  with SFAS 71 but would not have been  recognized as
assets and  liabilities by  enterprises in general,  along with an adjustment of
certain  accumulated  depreciation  accounts to reflect the  difference  between
recorded  depreciation  and the  amount of  depreciation  that  would  have been
recorded  had the  Company's  telephone  operations  not  been  subject  to rate
regulation.  SFAS 101 further  provides  that the carrying  amounts of property,
plant and  equipment  are to be  adjusted  only to the  extent  the  assets  are
impaired  and  that  impairment  shall  be  judged  in the  same  manner  as for
enterprises in general.  Deferred tax  liabilities  and deferred  investment tax
credits will be impacted  based on the change in the temporary  differences  for
property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation.

    The ongoing  applicability of SFAS 71 to the Company's  regulated  telephone
operations is being  monitored due to the changing  regulatory,  competitive and
legislative  environments,  and  it is  possible  that  changes  in  regulation,
legislation or  competition or in the demand for regulated  services or products
could result in the  Company's  telephone  operations no longer being subject to
SFAS 71 in the near  future.  When the  regulated  operations  of the Company no
longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, the net adjustments required will
result in a material,  noncash charge against earnings which will be reported as
an  extraordinary  item.  While the  effect of  implementing  SFAS 101 cannot be
precisely  estimated  at  this  time,  management  believes  that  the  noncash,
after-tax,  extraordinary charge would be between $250 million and $300 million.
For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of the Company's telephone
subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71.

(12)   EARNINGS PER SHARE

    Basic earnings per share amounts are determined on the basis of the weighted
average number of common shares  outstanding  during the year.  Diluted earnings
per  share  give  effect  to all  potential  dilutive  common  shares  that were
outstanding during the period. See Note 20 for additional information concerning
a stock split in early 1998.

    The following is a reconciliation  of the numerators and denominators of the
basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

the common  stock was  732,000,  944,000,  and 616,000 for 1997,  1996 and 1995,
respectively.

(13)   STOCK OPTION PROGRAM

    Century has an  incentive  compensation  program  which  allows the Board of
Directors,  through  a  subcommittee  to the  Compensation  Committee,  to grant
incentives  to employees in any one or a  combination  of the  following  forms:
incentive and non-qualified stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted
stock; and performance shares. As of December 31, 1997, Century had reserved 5.0
million  shares  of  common  stock  which  may be  issued  under  the  incentive
compensation program.

    Under the program,  options have been granted to employees at a price either
equal to or  exceeding  the  then-current  market  price and all of the  options
expire ten years after the date of grant.

    During 1997 the Company  granted  862,606  options  (the "1997  Options") at
market  price.  The weighted  average fair value of each of the 1997 Options was
estimated as of the date of grant to be $8.52 using an option-pricing model with
the following  assumptions:  dividend  yield - .8%;  expected  volatility - 25%;
risk-free interest rate - 6.5%; and expected option life - eight years.

    During 1995 the Company  granted  951,047 options (the "1995 Options") above
market price.  The  weighted-average  fair value of each of the 1995 Options was
estimated as of the date of grant to be $6.62 using an option-pricing model with
the following  assumptions:  dividend yield - 1.1%;  expected  volatility - 25%;
risk-free interest rate - 6.5%; and expected option life - eight years.

   Stock option transactions during 1997, 1996 and 1995 were as follows:

                                                        Number        Average

    The Company applies Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees," in accounting for its program.  Accordingly,  no
compensation cost has been recognized for the program.  If compensation cost for
Century's  program  had been  determined  consistent  with SFAS 123 for the 1997
Options and the 1995 Options, the Company's net income and earnings per share on
a pro forma basis for 1997, 1996 and 1995 would have been as follows:

(14)   SALES OF ASSETS

    In  May  1997  the  Company  sold  its  majority-owned   competitive  access
subsidiary  to  Brooks  Fiber  Properties,   Inc.  ("Brooks")  in  exchange  for
approximately 4.3 million shares of Brooks' common stock. The Company recorded a
pre-tax  gain of  approximately  $71 million ($46  million  after-tax;  $.50 per
diluted  share).  In November  1997 the Company sold  approximately  3.8 million
shares of Brooks'  common  stock for $202.7  million cash and recorded a pre-tax

million cash,  its ownership  interests in certain  cellular Rural Service Areas
located primarily in western states and three Metropolitan  Statistical Areas in
the midwest. These transactions resulted in a pre-tax gain of $5.9 million ($2.0
million after-tax; $.02 per diluted share).

(15)   RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS PLANS

    Century  sponsors an Outside  Directors'  Retirement Plan and a Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan to provide directors and officers,  respectively, with
supplemental  retirement,  death  and  disability  benefits.  In  addition,  the

                                                       1997           1996

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Century sponsors an Employee Stock Bonus Plan ("ESBP") and an Employee Stock
Ownership  Plan  ("ESOP").  These  plans cover most  employees  with one year of
service  with the  Company  and are funded by Company  contributions  determined
annually by the Board of Directors.

    The Company  contributed $2.8 million,  $1.9 million and $1.6 million to the
ESBP during 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  At December 31, 1997, the ESBP
owned 5.1 million shares of Century common stock.

    The Company's  contributions to the ESOP approximate the ESOP's debt service
less dividends  received by the ESOP applicable to unallocated  shares. The ESOP
shares initially were pledged as collateral for its debt. As the debt is repaid,
shares are released from collateral based on the percentage of principal payment
to outstanding debt before applying the principal payment.  As of each year end,
such released shares are allocated to active employees.

    The ESOP had outstanding debt of $2.0 million at December 31, 1997 which was
applicable to shares purchased prior to 1993.  Interest  incurred by the ESOP on
debt  applicable  to such shares was  $274,000,  $430,000  and $580,000 in 1997,
1996, and 1995, respectively. The Company contributed and expensed $1.8 million,
$2.1 million and $2.3 million  during 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively,  with
respect to such  shares.  Dividends  on  unallocated  ESOP  shares used for debt
service by the ESOP were  $126,000  in 1997,  $189,000  in 1996 and  $170,000 in
1995. ESOP shares as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 which were purchased prior to
1993 were as follows:


December 31,                                          1997            1996

=============================================================================

    The Company accounts for shares purchased subsequent to December 31, 1992 in
accordance with Statement of Position 93-6 ("SOP 93-6").  Accordingly, as shares
are released from collateral,  the Company reports compensation expense equal to
the current  market price of the shares and the shares  become  outstanding  for
earnings per share computations. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares are recorded
as a reduction of retained  earnings;  dividends on unallocated  ESOP shares are
recorded as a reduction of debt. ESOP compensation  expense applicable to shares
purchased  subsequent  to 1992 was $1.5 million for 1997,  $1.4 million for 1996
and $1.3 million for 1995.  The fair value of unreleased  ESOP shares  accounted
for under SOP 93-6 was $13.5  million and $9.7  million at December 31, 1997 and
December  31,  1996,  respectively.  ESOP shares  purchased  subsequent  to 1992
totaled 625,275,  of which 218,845 were allocated and 406,430 were unreleased as
of December 31, 1997.

    Century also  sponsors a qualified  profit  sharing plan pursuant to Section
401(k) of the Internal  Revenue  Code (the "401(k)  Plan") which is available to
substantially all employees of the Company. The Company's matching contributions
to the  401(k)  Plan were $2.8  million in 1997,  $2.3  million in 1996 and $2.4
million in 1995.

(16)   SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES

    The Company paid interest of $48.8 million,  $45.1 million and $45.8 million
during 1997, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Income taxes paid were $79.3 million
in 1997, $64.1 million in 1996 and $62.4 million in 1995.

    In  addition  to  the  acquisition  of  PTI,  Century  has  consummated  the
acquisitions of various  telephone and cellular  operations,  along with certain
other assets, during the three years ended December 31, 1997. In connection with

(3)  Fair value was estimated by discounting  the scheduled  payment  streams to
     present value based upon rates currently offered to the Company for similar
     debt.
(4)  Fair value  represents the estimated  amounts the Company would have to pay
     to settle these contracts.

Cash and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable, notes payable, accounts payable
and accrued  expenses - The carrying amount  approximates  the fair value due to
the short maturity of these instruments.

interest rate hedge  contracts for an aggregate  notional amount of $800 million
in  anticipation  of a public debt issuance.  In early January 1998, the Company

(19)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    Construction  expenditures and investments in vehicles,  buildings and other
work  equipment  during 1998 are  estimated  to be $220  million  for  telephone
operations,  $90 million for wireless  operations  and $40 million for corporate
and other operations.

    The Company is involved in various  claims and legal actions  arising in the
ordinary  course  of  business.  In the  opinion  of  management,  the  ultimate
disposition  of these  matters  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

(20) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Debt  issuance - On January 15,  1998,  Century  issued $100  million of 7-year,
6.15%  senior  notes  (Series E); $240  million of  10-year,  6.3% senior  notes
(Series F); and $425 million of 30-year,  6.875% debentures (Series G) under its
shelf  registration  statements.  The net proceeds of approximately $758 million
(excluding payment  obligations of approximately $39 million related to interest
rate hedging  effected in connection  with the offering) were used to reduce the
Senior Credit Facility  indebtedness  incurred by the Company in connection with
the  acquisition  of PTI. In addition,  the Senior Credit  Facility's  committed
amount was reduced  from $1.6  billion to $880  million in  accordance  with its
terms.

    In mid-January  1998, the Company settled  numerous hedge contracts that had
been entered into in anticipation of the debt issuances. The amounts paid by the
Company upon  settlement of the hedge  contracts  aggregated  $39 million.  Such
payment  obligations  will be amortized as interest expense over the life of the
underlying debt instruments. The effective weighted average interest rate of the
above-mentioned  debt (after giving consideration to the payment obligations) is
7.15%.

Stock split - On February 25,  1998,  Century's  Board of  Directors  declared a
three-for-two common stock split effected as a 50% stock dividend in March 1998.
All per share data  included  in this report has been  restated to reflect  this
stock split.  An amount equal to the par value of the  additional  common shares
issued  pursuant  to the  stock  split has been  reflected  as a  transfer  from
paid-in-capital  to common stock on the  consolidated  financial  statements for
1997.
