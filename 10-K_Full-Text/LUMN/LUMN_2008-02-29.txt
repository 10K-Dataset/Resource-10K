Business

General

.    CenturyTel,
Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company
engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services, including
local and long distance voice, Internet access and broadband
services.  We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among
other things, bundling our service offerings to provide a complete offering of
integrated communications services.  We conduct all of our operations
in 25 states located within the continental United States.

At
December 31, 2007, our incumbent local exchange telephone subsidiaries operated
approximately 2.1 million telephone access lines, primarily in rural areas and
small to mid-size cities in 24 states, with over 68% of these lines located in
Missouri, Wisconsin, Alabama, Arkansas and Washington.  According to
published sources, we are the seventh largest local exchange telephone company
in the United States based on the number of access lines served.

We also
provide fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier, security
monitoring, and other communications and business information services in
certain local and regional markets.

Since
2005, we have expanded our product offerings to include satellite television
services, wireless communications services under a reselling arrangement and
wireless broadband services.   For additional information, see
“Operations - Recent Product Developments” below.

For
information on the amount of revenue derived by our various lines of services,
see “Operations - Services” below and Item 7 of this annual report.

Recent
acquisitions

.    On April 30, 2007, we acquired all
of the outstanding stock of Madison River Communications Corp. (“Madison River”)
for approximately $322 million cash (including the effect of post-closing
adjustments).  In connection with the acquisition, we also paid all of
Madison River’s existing indebtedness (including accrued interest), which
approximated $522 million.  At the time of this acquisition, Madison
River operated approximately 164,000 predominantly rural access lines in four
states with more than 30% high-speed Internet penetration and its network
included ownership in a 2,400 route mile fiber network.

In June
2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom
Holdings, Inc. (“KMC”) for approximately $75.5 million cash, which has enabled
us to offer broadband and competitive local exchange services to customers in
these markets.

In June
2003, we purchased for $39.4 million cash the assets of Digital Teleport, Inc.,
a regional communications company providing wholesale data transport services to
other communications carriers over its fiber optic network located in Missouri,
Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas.  In addition, in December 2003, we
acquired additional fiber transport assets in Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois
from Level 3 Communications, Inc. for approximately $15.8 million
cash.  For additional information, see “Operations - Services - Fiber
Transport and CLEC.”

We also
acquired approximately 660,000, 490,000 and 650,000 telephone access lines in
transactions completed in 1997, 2000 and 2002, respectively, each of which
substantially expanded our operations.  The 2002 acquisition of
telephone access lines was funded primarily from proceeds received from the sale
of substantially all of our wireless operations in August 2002.

We
continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications
assets in exchange for cash, securities or both, and at any given time may be
engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional
acquisitions.  We generally do not announce our acquisitions or
dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive
agreement.  Although our primary focus will continue to be on
acquiring interests that are proximate to our properties or that serve a
customer base large enough for us to operate efficiently, we may also acquire
other communications interests and these acquisitions could have a material
impact upon us.

Where to find additional
information.

We make available our filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K on our
website (

www.centurytel.com

)
as soon as reasonably practicable after we complete such filings with the
SEC.  These documents may also be obtained from the SEC’s website at

www.sec.gov

.

We also
make available on our website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Corporate
Compliance Program and the charters of our audit, compensation, risk evaluation,
and nominating and corporate governance committees.  We will furnish
printed copies of these materials free of charge upon the request of any
shareholder.  If a provision of our Corporate Compliance Program is
amended, other than by a technical, administrative or other non-substantive
amendment, or a waiver under this program is granted to a director or executive
officer, notice of such amendment or waiver will be posted on our
website.  Also, we may elect to disclose the amendment or waiver in a
report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.  Only our board of directors
may consider a waiver of our Corporate Compliance Program for a director or
executive officer.

In
connection with filing this annual report, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer made the certifications regarding our financial disclosures
required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Act’s related
regulations.  In addition, during 2007 our chief executive officer
certified to the New York Stock Exchange that he was unaware of any violation by
us of the New York Stock Exchange’s corporate governance listing
standards.

Industry
information

.  Unless otherwise indicated, information contained
in this annual report and other documents filed by us under the federal
securities laws concerning our views and expectations regarding the
communications industry are based on estimates made by us using data from
industry sources, and on assumptions made by us based on our management’s
knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate and the
communications industry generally.  We believe these estimates and
assumptions are accurate as of the date made; however, this information may
prove to be inaccurate because it cannot always be verified with
certainty.  You should be aware that we have not independently
verified data from industry or other third-party sources and cannot guarantee
its accuracy or completeness.  Our estimates and assumptions involve
risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors,
including those discussed in Item 1A of this annual report.

Other

.  As of
December 31, 2007, we had approximately 6,600 employees, of which approximately
1,600 were members of 15 different bargaining units represented by the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Communications Workers
of America.   We believe that relations with our employees
continue to be generally good.  During 2006 and 2007, we announced
reductions of our workforce which aggregated approximately 600 jobs, primarily
due to (i) increased competitive pressures, (ii) the loss of access lines over
the last several years and (iii) progress made on our Madison River integration
plan.

We were
incorporated under Louisiana law in 1968 to serve as a holding company for
several telephone companies acquired over the previous 15 to 20 years. Our
principal executive offices are located at 100 CenturyTel Drive, Monroe,
Louisiana 71203 and our telephone number is (318) 388-9000.

OPERATIONS

According
to published sources, we are the seventh largest local exchange telephone
company in the United States, based on the approximately 2.1 million access
lines we served at December 31, 2007.  An “access line” is a telephone
line that connects a home or business to the public switched telephone
network.  All of our access lines are digitally switched. Through our
operating telephone subsidiaries, we provide local exchange services to
predominantly rural areas and small to mid-size cities in 24
states.

The
following table lists additional information regarding our access lines as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006.

As
      of December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 51,000 and 53,000,
      respectively, of these lines were owned and operated by our 89%-owned
      affiliate.

(2)

In
      connection with our acquisition of Madison River in April 2007, we
      acquired an aggregate of approximately 164,000 access lines in Illinois,
      Alabama, Georgia and North
Carolina.

The
following table summarizes certain information related to our customer base,
operating revenues and capital expenditures for the past five
years.  The 2007 information includes the Madison River properties we
acquired on April 30, 2007.

As
discussed further below, our access lines (exclusive of acquisitions) have
declined in recent years, and are expected to continue to decline.  To
mitigate these declines, we hope to, among other things, (i) promote long-term
relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services, (ii)
provide new services, such as video and wireless, and other additional services
that may become available in the future due to advances in technology, spectrum
sales or improvements in our infrastructure, (iii) provide our premium services
to a higher percentage of our customers, (iv) pursue acquisitions of additional
communications properties if available at attractive prices, (v) increase usage
of our networks, (vi) provide greater penetration of broadband services and
(vii) market our products to new customers.  See “Services” and
“Regulation and Competition.”

Services

We derive
revenue from providing (i) local exchange and long distance voice telephone
services, (ii) network access services, (iii) data services, which includes both
high-speed and dial-up Internet services, as well as special access and private
line services, (iv) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security
monitoring services and (v) other related services. The following table reflects
the percentage of operating revenues derived from these respective
services:

Voice.

We derive
our local service revenues by providing local exchange telephone services in our
franchised service areas, including basic dial-tone service through our regular
switched network, generally for a fixed monthly charge.  Normalized
for acquisitions, dispositions and other adjustments, access lines declined 5.7%
in 2007, 4.8% in 2006 and 4.3% in 2005.  We believe these declines in
the number of access lines were primarily due to the displacement of traditional
wireline telephone services by other competitive services.  Based on
our planned results for recent sales and retention initiatives, we are targeting
our access line loss to be between 4.5% and 6.0% in 2008.

We offer
enhanced voice services (such as call forwarding, conference calling, caller
identification, selective call ringing and call waiting) to our local exchange
customers for additional charges.  In 2007, we continued to expand the
availability of enhanced voice services offered in certain service
areas.  At December 31, 2007, over 60% of both our business and
residential customers subscribed to one or more enhanced voice
services.

We derive
our long distance revenues by providing retail long distance services based on
either usage or pursuant to flat-rate calling plans.  At December 31,
2007, we provided long distance services to nearly 1.3 million
lines.    Exclusive of the long distance lines associated
with Madison River, our long distance lines declined slightly in 2007,
principally due to competitive factors.  We anticipate that most of
our long distance service will be provided as part of an integrated bundle with
our other service offerings, including our local exchange telephone service
offering.

Network access.

We
derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to
various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to
originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions and
(ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion of
our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms (see “Regulation and
Competition Relating to Incumbent Local Exchange Operations”
below).  Our revenues for switched access services depend primarily on
the level of call volume.

Certain
of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges
prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”); the remainder of
such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local
exchange carriers (“LECs”) administered by the National Exchange Carrier
Association (“NECA”), a quasi-governmental non-profit organization formed by the
FCC in 1983 for such purposes.

Certain
of our intrastate network access revenues are derived through access charges
that we bill to intrastate long distance carriers and other LEC customers. Such
intrastate network access charges are based on tariffed access charges, which
are subject to state regulatory commission approval. Additionally, certain of
our intrastate network access revenues, along with intrastate and intra-LATA
(Local Access and Transport Areas) long distance revenues, are derived through
revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs.

The
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”) allows local exchange carriers
to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met,
deems those tariffs lawful.  Tariffs that have been “deemed lawful” in
effect nullify an interexchange carrier’s ability to seek refunds should the
earnings from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized
rate of return prescribed by the FCC.  Certain of our telephone
subsidiaries file interstate tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing
approach.  Since July 2004, we have recognized billings from our
tariffs as revenue since we believe such tariffs are “deemed
lawful”.

Data.

We
derive

our data
revenues primarily from monthly recurring charges for providing Internet access
services (both high-speed and dial-up services) and data transmission services
over special circuits and private lines.   We began offering
traditional dial-up Internet access services to our telephone customers in
1995.  In late 1999, we began offering high-speed Internet access
services, a premium-priced broadband data service.  As of December 31,
2007, approximately 84% of our access lines were
broadband-enabled.  At December 31, 2007, we provided high-speed
Internet access services to over 555,000 customers and dial-up services to
nearly 68,000 customers.  During 2007, we added over 186,000
high-speed Internet customers (which includes approximately 58,000 from the
Madison River acquisition).

Our data
revenue also includes amounts billed to our business customers for dedicated
circuits used for various purposes, including connecting the customer’s offices
or networks to our networks.

Fiber transport and
CLEC

.  Our fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues
from our fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) and
security monitoring businesses.

In late
2000, we began offering competitive local exchange telephone services as part of
a bundled service offering to small to medium-sized businesses in Monroe and
Shreveport, Louisiana.  In February 2002, we purchased the fiber
network and customer base of KMC’s operations in Monroe and Shreveport,
Louisiana and in June 2005, we purchased the fiber assets in 16 metropolitan
markets from KMC which allowed us to offer broadband and competitive local
exchange services to customers in these markets.  We intend to focus
our efforts on the CLEC markets with the most promise, and are exploring our
alternatives with respect to the remaining markets.  As of December
31, 2007, our competitive local exchange markets provided service over 1,200
miles of fiber.

Under the
name “LightCore”, we sell fiber capacity to other carriers and businesses over a
network that encompassed, at December 31, 2007, over 9,900 miles of fiber in the
central United States.  We began our fiber transport business during
2001, when we began selling capacity over a 700-mile fiber optic ring that we
constructed in southern and central Michigan.  In June 2003, we
acquired the assets of Digital Teleport, Inc., a regional communications company
providing wholesale data transport services to other communications carriers
over its fiber optic network located in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and
Kansas.  We have used the network to sell services to new and existing
customers and to reduce our reliance on third party transport
providers.  In addition, in December 2003, we acquired additional
fiber transport assets in Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois from Level 3
Communications, Inc. to provide services similar to those described
above.

In
addition to the above-described fiber network, in connection with our 2007
acquisition of Madison River, we acquired ownership in a 2,400 route mile fiber
network located in six states which provides us the opportunity to expand our
fiber network business and further reduce our reliance on third-party transport
providers.

We offer
24-hour burglary and fire monitoring services to over 10,500 customers in select
markets in Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Ohio.

Other.

We derive
our “other revenues” principally by (i) leasing, selling, installing and
maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii)
providing billing and collection services to third parties, (iii) participating
in the publication of local telephone directories, which allows us to share in
revenues generated by the sale of yellow page and related advertising to
businesses, and (iv) offering our new services described below under the heading
“-Recent Product Developments”.  We also provide printing, database
management and direct mail services and cable television services.

From time
to time, we also make investments in other domestic or foreign communications
companies.

For
further information on regulatory, technological and competitive changes that
could impact our revenues, see “Regulation and Competition” under this Item 1
below and “Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements” under Item 1A
below.  For more information on the financial contributions of our
various services, see Item 7 of this annual report.

Recent
Product Developments

Since
2005, we have offered in conjunction with EchoStar Communications Corporation
(“EchoStar”) co-branded DISH Network satellite television service in
substantially all of our local exchange service areas.  Effective
January 1, 2007, we changed our relationship with EchoStar from a revenue
sharing arrangement to an agency relationship.  In late 2005, we
initiated our switched digital television service to the LaCrosse, Wisconsin
market and, in October 2007, we commenced a second switched digital video
service offering to our Columbia, Missouri market.

We also offer wireless communications services through a reselling arrangement
with a nationwide wireless carrier and wireless broadband Internet services in
select locations in certain markets in eight states.

Federal
Financing Programs

Certain
of our telephone subsidiaries receive long-term financing from the Rural
Utilities Service (“RUS”), a federal agency that has historically provided
long-term financing to telephone companies at relatively attractive interest
rates.  Approximately 14% of our plant is pledged to secure
obligations of our telephone subsidiaries to the RUS.  For additional
information regarding our financing, see our consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8 herein.

Sales
and Marketing

We
maintain local offices in most of the larger population centers within our
service territories.  These offices are typically staffed by local
residents and provide sales and customer support services in the
community.  We also rely on our call center personnel to promote sales
of services that meet the distinctive needs of our customers.  In
addition, our strategy is to enhance our communications services by offering
comprehensive bundling of services and deploying new technologies to build upon
the strong reputation we enjoy in our markets and to further promote customer
loyalty.

Most of
our services are offered under our “CenturyTel” brand name.  However,
we sell fiber capacity on our networks under the brand name
“LightCore.”  In addition, our satellite television service is offered
on a co-branded basis with EchoStar under the DISH Network name.

Network
Architecture

Our local
exchange carrier networks consist of central office hosts and remote sites, all
with advanced digital switches (primarily manufactured by Nortel and Siemens)
and operating with licensed software.  Our outside plant consists of
transport and distribution delivery networks connecting each of our host central
offices to our remote central offices, and ultimately to our
customers.  As of December 31, 2007, we maintained over 252,000 miles
of copper plant and approximately 20,000 miles of fiber optic plant in our local
exchange networks.  Our fiber optic cable is the primary transport
technology between our host and remote central offices and interconnection
points with other incumbent carriers.  Most of our long distance
service is provided directly through our own switches and network equipment,
with the balance being provided through reselling arrangements with other long
distance carriers.  We also maintain networks in connection with
providing fiber transport and CLEC services.  For additional
information on these networks, see “Services -  Fiber Transport and
CLEC.”

Regulation
and Competition Relating to Incumbent Local Exchange Operations

Traditionally,
LECs operated as regulated monopolies having the exclusive right and
responsibility to provide local telephone services in their franchised service
territories.  (These LECs are sometimes referred to below as
“incumbent LECs” or “ILECs”).  Consequently, most of our intrastate
telephone operations have traditionally been regulated extensively by various
state regulatory agencies (generally called public service commissions or public
utility commissions) and our interstate operations have been regulated by the
FCC under the Communications Act of 1934.  As we discuss in greater
detail below, passage of the 1996 Act, coupled with state legislative and
regulatory initiatives and technological changes, fundamentally altered the
telephone industry by generally reducing the regulation of LECs and attracting a
substantial increase in the number of competitors and capital invested in
existing and new services. We anticipate that these trends toward reduced
regulation and increased competition will continue.

The
following description discusses some of the major industry regulations that
affect our traditional telephone operations, but numerous other regulations not
discussed below could also impact us.  Some legislation and
regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative
hearings and administrative proposals which could substantially change the
manner in which the communications industry operates.  Neither the
outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us, can be
predicted at this time.  The impact of regulatory changes in the
communications industry could have a substantial impact on our
operations.  See Item 1A of this annual report below.

State
regulation

.  The local service rates and intrastate access
charges of substantially all of our telephone subsidiaries are regulated by
state regulatory commissions which typically have the power to grant and revoke
certifications authorizing companies to provide communications
services.  Most commissions have traditionally regulated pricing
through “rate of return” regulation that focuses on authorized levels of
earnings by LECs.  Historically, most of these commissions also (i)
regulated the purchase and sale of LECs, (ii) prescribed depreciation rates and
certain accounting procedures, (iii) enforced laws requiring LECs to provide
universal service under publicly filed tariffs setting forth the terms,
conditions and prices of their LEC services, (iv) oversaw implementation of
several federal telecommunications laws including interconnection obligations
and (v) regulated various other matters, including certain service standards and
operating procedures.

In recent
years, state legislatures and regulatory commissions in most of the 24 states in
which our telephone subsidiaries operate have either reduced the regulation of
LECs or have announced their intention to do so, and we expect this trend will
continue.  Essentially, such relief comes in two forms: (i) full or
partial deregulation through legislation or (ii) the ability to elect into or
renew existing state alternative regulation through a regulatory
proceeding.  Several states have implemented laws or rulings which
require or permit LECs at the state level to either be deregulated for pricing
or opt out of “rate of return” regulation in exchange for agreeing to
alternative forms of regulation.   Such alternatives permit the
LEC greater freedom to establish local service rates in exchange for agreeing
not to charge rates in excess of specified caps.  As discussed further
below, subsidiaries operating over 72% of our access lines in various states
have agreed to be governed by alternative regulation plans, and we continue to
explore our options for similar treatment in other states.  We believe
that reduced regulatory oversight of certain of our telephone operations may
allow us to offer new and competitive services faster than under the traditional
regulatory process.  For a discussion of legislative, regulatory and
technological changes that have introduced competition into the local exchange
industry, see “Developments Affecting Competition.”

The
following summary describes the alternative regulation plans applicable to us in
Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama and Arkansas, our four largest telephone
markets.

·

Our
Wisconsin access lines, except for those acquired from Verizon in 2000 (which
continue to be regulated under “rate of return” regulation), are regulated under
various alternative regulation plans developed jointly between the Wisconsin
Public Service Commission and us.  Each of these alternative
regulation plans permits us to adjust local rates within specified parameters if
we meet certain quality-of-service and infrastructure-development commitments.
These plans also include initiatives designed to promote
competition.

·

All of
our Missouri LECs are regulated under a price-cap regulation plan whereby basic
service rates are adjusted annually based on an inflation-based factor;
non-basic services may be increased without restriction up to 5%
annually.   If the inflation-based factor were to decline as it
has done in recent years, our revenues would be negatively
impacted.

·

In
2005,  the state of Alabama passed legislation that essentially
allowed telephone companies the option to phase in deregulation of certain LEC
services.  In February 2007, our Alabama LECs opted to provide all
local services (including bundled services but excluding certain basic telephone
and optional calling services) on a deregulated and detariffed
basis.  Certain basic telephone and optional calling services continue
to be regulated and subject to a price cap.  Our Alabama properties
acquired from Madison River operate under a separate alternative regulation plan
under which local rates are still governed by the state public service
commission.

·

Our
Arkansas LECs acquired from Verizon Communications, Inc. are regulated under an
alternative regulation plan under which rates can be adjusted based on an
inflation-based factor.  Other local rates can be adjusted without
commission approval; however, such rates are subject to commission review under
certain conditions.   Our remaining Arkansas LECs have the option
to increase rates up to certain specified amounts.

Notwithstanding
the movement toward alternative regulation, LECs operating approximately 28% of
our total access lines continue to be subject to “rate of return” regulation for
intrastate purposes.  These LECs remain subject to the powers of state
regulatory commissions to conduct earnings reviews and adjust service rates,
either of which could lead to revenue reductions.

Federal regulation

. Our
telephone subsidiaries are required to comply with the Communications Act of
1934, which requires us to offer services at just and reasonable rates and on
non-discriminatory terms, as well as the 1996 Act, which amended the
Communications Act to promote competition and reform the Universal Service
Program.

The FCC
regulates interstate services provided by our telephone subsidiaries primarily
by regulating the interstate access charges that we bill to long distance
companies and other communications companies for use of our network in
connection with the origination and termination of interstate voice and data
transmissions. Additionally, the FCC has prescribed certain rules and
regulations for telephone companies, including a uniform system of accounts and
rules regarding the separation of costs between jurisdictions and, ultimately,
between interstate services.  In addition, the FCC has responsibility
for maintaining and administering the Universal Service Fund.  LECs
must obtain

FCC approval to use certain radio frequencies, or to transfer
control of any such licenses.  The FCC retains the right to revoke
these licenses if a carrier materially violates relevant legal
requirements.

The FCC
requires price-cap regulation of interstate access rates for the Regional Bell
Operating Companies, and permits it for all other LECs. Under price-cap
regulation, limits imposed on a company’s interstate rates are adjusted
periodically to reflect inflation, productivity improvement and changes in
certain non-controllable costs.  We have not elected price-cap
regulation for our telephone operations, except for the properties we acquired
from Verizon in 2002 which have continued to operate under price-cap regulation,
as permitted under FCC rules for acquired properties.  All of our
other operations continue to be governed by traditional rate-of-return
regulation for interstate access charges, which permits us to set rates based on
forecasted investment and expenses plus a return on investment, which is
currently 11.25%.  In the last half of 2007, certain carriers filed a
petition with the FCC seeking to convert their properties from rate of return
regulation to price-cap regulation in the interstate jurisdiction.  In
order to achieve this conversion, these carriers petitioned the FCC to make
numerous rule changes that would provide a blueprint for rate of return carriers
to opt into price-cap regulation.

In 2003,
the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate
goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications
industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, or carrying
telecommunications traffic.  The FCC has received intercarrier
compensation proposals from several industry groups, and in early 2005 solicited
comments on all proposals previously submitted to it.  Broad industry
negotiations have taken place with the goal of developing a consensus plan that
addresses the concerns of carriers from all industry segments.  The
ultimate outcome of this proceeding could change the way we receive compensation
from, and remit compensation to, other carriers, our end user customers and the
federal Universal Service Fund (the “USF”).  Until the FCC’s
proceeding concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are
established, we cannot estimate the impact it will have on our results of
operations.

In
December 2005, a group of six mid-size carriers, including us, filed proposed
rules with the FCC regarding “phantom traffic”.  “Phantom traffic”
generally refers to telecommunications calls that cannot be billed properly to
responsible carriers by other carriers in the call path because the traffic is
mislabeled, unlabeled or improperly routed.  The proposal requests
that the FCC implement and enforce updated rules that require carriers to
accurately identify, label and route network traffic so that appropriate bills
can be created.  In late 2006, the FCC opened a separate phantom
traffic proceeding with the intent of formalizing potential phantom traffic
rules for the industry.  Overall, the comments received to date on the
phantom traffic issue have been favorable to us; however, until the FCC
concludes its phantom traffic proceeding and adopts changes, if any, to existing
rules, we cannot estimate the impact any changes will have on our results of
operations.

As
discussed further below, certain providers of competitive communications
services are currently not required to compensate ILECs for the use of their
networks.  Additionally, certain deregulated providers seek and
receive high cost universal support funding based on the incumbent’s costs
rather than their own.

Our
operations and those of all communications carriers also may be impacted by
legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to
assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland security, minimizing
environmental impacts, or addressing other issues that impact our business,
including the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, and laws
governing local number portability and customer proprietary network information
requirements.  These laws and regulations may cause us to incur
additional costs.

Universal service support funds,
revenue sharing arrangements and related matters

. A significant number of
our telephone subsidiaries recover a portion of their costs from the federal USF
and from similar state “universal support” mechanisms, which receive their
funding from fees charged to interexchange carriers and
LECs.  Disbursements from these programs traditionally have focused
principally on allowing LECs serving small communities and rural areas to
provide communications services on terms and at prices reasonably comparable to
those available in urban areas.  Other USF programs address other
social goals, such as supporting schools and libraries through the USF’s E-rate
program.

The table
below sets forth the amounts received by our telephone subsidiaries in 2007 and
2006 from federal and state universal support programs.

Federal
USF programs have undergone substantial changes since 1997, and are expected to
experience more changes in the coming years as modernization of the overall
program moves forward.  As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the
FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural
telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five-year period
based on embedded, or historical, costs that provide relatively predictable
levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our
LECs.   In May 2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism
until such time that new high-cost support rules are adopted for rural telephone
companies.

Universal
support funds available to ILECs are currently available to local competitors
that (i) certify they will serve all customers in a study area, (ii) offer nine
core services, and (iii) qualify as an “eligible telecommunications
carrier.”  Wireless and other competitive service providers continue
to seek to qualify to receive USF support.  This trend, coupled with
changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stress on the
funding mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on
disbursements.  These developments have placed additional financial
pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide
support to all eligible service providers, including support payments we receive
from the USF High Cost Loop support program.

A
significant portion of our support payments have varied over time based on our
average cost to serve customers compared to national cost
averages.  Under the USF High Cost Loop support program, which is the
USF’s principal support program, our payments from the USF will decrease if
national average costs per loop increase at a rate greater than our average cost
per loop.  Increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor
used to allocate funds among all USF recipients caused our revenues from the USF
High Cost Loop support program to decrease in 2006 when compared to
2005.  While our 2007 USF High Cost Loop support program receipts
approximated 2006 levels, we anticipate that our 2008 revenues from the USF High
Cost Loop support program will be lower than 2007 by approximately $14-$17
million.

In late
2002, the FCC requested that the Federal-State Joint Board (“FSJB”) on Universal
Service review various FCC rules governing high cost universal service support,
including rules regarding eligibility to receive support payments in markets
served by LECs and competitive carriers.   Since then, the FSJB
recommended a comprehensive general review of the high-cost support mechanisms
for rural and non-rural carriers and requested comments on the FCC’s current
rules for the provision of high-cost support for rural companies, including
comments on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that
would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us.  In addition, the
FCC has taken various other steps in anticipation of restructuring universal
service support mechanisms, including, most recently, opening for public comment
in early 2008 several proposals that contemplate a substantial restructuring of
current USF programs.

On May 1,
2007, the FSJB proposed that the FCC consider an interim cap on the amount of
high cost support that competitive eligible telecommunications carriers
(“CETCs”) may receive.  On November 20, 2007, the FSJB issued another
recommended decision on universal service reform which suggested various reform
measures including a migration of the present funding mechanisms to three new
separate funds covering broadband providers, mobility providers, and providers
of last resort.  The FSJB also recommended elimination of the
identical support rule which now enables wireless CETCs to draw identical
support based on the ILEC’s cost.   In addition, the FSJB is
recommending certain other reforms, including (i) caps on the present high cost
funding mechanism, (ii) certification of only one wireline, one wireless and one
broadband carrier in each market and (iii) further consideration of competitive
bidding as a distribution mechanism.  Until the FCC acts on these
recommendations, we cannot estimate the impact that such proposals would have on
our operations.  In addition, there are a number of judicial appeals
challenging several aspects of the FCC’s universal service rules and various
Congressional proposals seeking to substantially modify USF programs, none of
which have been resolved at this time.  We will continue to be active
in monitoring and participating in these developments.

In 2004,
the FCC mandated changes in the administration of the universal service support
programs that temporarily suspended the disbursement of funds under the USF’s
E-rate program (for service to Schools and Libraries), and, more significantly,
created questions that these administrative changes could similarly delay the
disbursement of funds to LECs from the Universal Service High Cost Loop support
program.  Congress has passed bills in recent years granting
successive one-year exemptions from the federal law that impacted the E-rate
program, including a bill extending the exemption through December 31, 2007. An
additional exemption is currently pending before Congress.  Although
we expect funding from this program to continue, we cannot assure you that the
lack of a definitive resolution of this issue will not delay or impede the
disbursement of funds in the future.

A
substantial portion of our state support payments are payable by Louisiana under
a program restructured in 2005 into a state universal service fund that expanded
the base of contributors to include all telecommunication service providers
operating in Louisiana.  Thus far, the payments we have received under
this fund approximate those received by us under Louisiana’s predecessor
program.  The fund is subject to an annual review by the Louisiana
Public Service Commission (the “LPSC”).  As such, there can be no
assurance that the fund will remain as adopted by the LPSC or that funding
levels will remain at current levels.  In November 2007, the LPSC
initiated a docket to determine the best way to convert the existing universal
service fund to a stable funding mechanism.  The LPSC currently
expects to complete its review by December 2008.

Some of
our telephone subsidiaries operate in states where traditional cost recovery
mechanisms, including rate structures, are under evaluation or have been
modified. See “ State Regulation”.  There can be no assurance that
these states will continue to provide for cost recovery at current
levels.

All of
our interstate network access revenues are based on access charges, cost
separation studies or special settlement arrangements, many of which are
administered by the FCC or NECA, and all of which are subject to
change.  See “Services.”

Certain
long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce
intrastate access tariffed rates.  Long distance carriers have also
aggressively pursued regulatory or legislative changes that would reduce access
rates.   However, in light of pending intercarrier compensation
reform that is expected to address intrastate access charges, most states are
deferring action until they receive direction from the FCC.  However,
some carriers are continuing to pursue lower intrastate access rates in some
states.

Developments affecting
competition

.  Over the past decade, fundamental technological,
regulatory and legislative changes have significantly impacted the
communications industry, and we expect these changes will
continue.  Primarily as a result of regulatory and technological
changes, competition has been introduced and encouraged in each sector of the
communications industry in recent years.  As a result, we increasingly
face competition from other communication service providers, as further
described below.

Wireless
telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition
with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete
effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone
services.  As a result, some customers have chosen to completely
forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on
wireless service for voice services.  This trend is more pronounced
among residential customers, which comprise 73% of our access line
customers.  We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if
wireless service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their
rates, improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new
services.  Substantially all of our access line customers are
currently capable of receiving wireless services from a competitive service
provider.  Technological and regulatory developments in wireless
services, personal communications services, digital microwave, satellite,
coaxial cable, fiber optics, local multipoint distribution services and other
wired and wireless technologies are expected to further permit the development
of alternatives to traditional landline services.

The 1996
Act, which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities
to the LEC’s network and to take various other steps that are designed to
promote competition, imposes several duties on a LEC if it receives a specific
request from another entity which seeks to connect with or provide services
using the LEC’s network.  In addition, each incumbent LEC is obligated
to (i) negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide
nondiscriminatory “unbundled” access to all aspects of the LEC’s network, (iii)
offer resale of its telecommunications services at wholesale rates and (iv)
permit competitors, on terms and conditions (including rates) that are just,
reasonable and nondiscriminatory, to collocate their physical plant on the LEC’s
property, or provide virtual collocation if physical collocation is not
practicable.  During 2003, the FCC released new rules outlining the
obligations of incumbent LECs to lease to competitors elements of their
circuit-switched networks on an unbundled basis at prices that substantially
limited the profitability of these arrangements to incumbent LECs.  In
response to successful judicial challenges to these rules, in 2005 the FCC
released rules that required incumbent LECs to lease a network element only in
those situations where competing carriers genuinely would be impaired without
access to such network element, and where the unbundling would not interfere
with the development of facilities-based competition. These rules are further
designed to remove LECs’ unbundling obligations over time as competing carriers
deploy their own networks and local exchange competition increases.

Under the
1996 Act’s rural telephone company exemption, approximately half of our
telephone access lines are exempt from certain of the 1996 Act’s interconnection
requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission
overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request
meeting certain criteria.  States are permitted to adopt laws or
regulations that provide for greater competition than is mandated under the 1996
Act.

As a
result of these regulatory, consumer and technological developments, ILECs
increasingly face competition from CLECs, particularly in densely populated
areas.  CLECs provide competing services through reselling the ILECs’
local services, through use of the ILECs’ unbundled network elements or through
their own facilities.  The number of companies which have requested
authorization to provide local exchange service in our service areas has
increased in recent years, especially in our markets acquired from Verizon in
2002 and 2000.  We anticipate that similar action may be taken by
other competitors in the future, especially if all forms of federal support
available to ILECs continue to remain available to these
competitors.

As noted
above, wireless and other competitive services providers have been increasingly
aggressive in seeking and obtaining USF support funds.  This support
is likely to encourage additional competitors to enter our high-cost service
areas.

Technological
developments have led to the development of new services that compete with
traditional LEC services.  Technological improvements have enabled
cable television companies to provide telephone service over their cable
networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this
opportunity.  As of December 31, 2007, we believe that approximately
40-45% of our access lines currently face competition from cable voice
offerings.  Additionally, several large electric utilities have
announced plans to offer communications services that compete with some
LECs.

Improvements
in the quality of VoIP service have led several cable, Internet, data and other
communications companies, as well as start-up companies, to substantially
increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential
customers.  VoIP providers route calls partially or wholly over the
Internet, without use of ILEC's circuit switches and, in certain cases, without
use of ILEC's networks to carry their communications traffic.  VoIP
providers frequently use existing broadband networks to deliver flat-rate, all
distance calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided
by traditional LECs.  These plans may also be priced competitively or
below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone
services for several reasons, including lower operating
costs.   In December 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking that is
expected to address the effect of VoIP on intercarrier compensation, universal
service and emergency services.  Although the FCC’s rulemaking
regarding VoIP-enabled services remains pending, the FCC has adopted orders
establishing broad guidelines for the regulation of such services, including (i)
an April 2004 order that found an IP-telephony service using the public switched
telephone network to be a regulated telecommunications service subject to
interstate access charges, (ii) a November 2004 order that Internet-based
services provided by Vonage Holdings Corporation should be subject to federal
rather than state regulation and (iii) a June 2005 order requiring all VoIP
service providers whose services are interconnected to the public switched
telephone network to provide E-911 services to their customers.  There
can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs,
or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our
customers.

Similar
to us, many cable, entertainment, technology or other communications companies
that previously offered a limited range of services are now offering diversified
bundles of services, either through their own networks, reselling arrangements
or joint ventures.  As such, a growing number of companies are
competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer
base.   Several of these companies started offering full service
bundles before us, which could give them an advantage in building customer
loyalty.  Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on
the demand for our access lines.

In
addition to facing direct competition from those providers described above,
ILECs increasingly face competition from alternate communication systems
constructed by long distance carriers, large customers or alternative access
vendors.  These systems, which have become more prevalent as a result
of the 1996 Act, are capable of originating or terminating calls without use of
the ILECs’ networks or switching services.  Other potential sources of
competition include non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing ILECs’
local networks, either partially or completely, through various means, including
the provision of special access or independent switching services and the
concentration of telecommunications traffic on a few of the ILECs’ access
lines.  We anticipate that all these trends will continue and lead to
decreased use of our networks.

Significant
competitive factors in the local telephone industry include pricing, packaging
of services and features, quality and convenience of service and meeting
customer needs such as simplified billing and timely response to service
calls.

As the
telephone industry increasingly experiences competition, the size and resources
of each respective competitor may increasingly influence its prospects. Many
companies currently providing or planning to provide competitive communication
services have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do
or own larger or more diverse networks than ours.  In addition, many
of them are not subject to the same regulatory constraints we are.

Competition
can harm us by causing us to lose customers, or by causing us to lower prices or
increase our capital or operating expenses to retain
customers.  Competing communications services, such as wireless, VoIP,
electronic mail and optional calling services, can also reduce usage of our
network and thereby decrease our network access revenues.  Competition
can also cause customers to reduce either usage of our services or switch to
less profitable services, and could impede our ability to diversify into new
lines of business dominated by incumbent providers.

We
anticipate that the traditional operations of LECs will continue to be impacted
by changes in regulation, technology, and consumer preferences affecting the
ability of LECs to attract and retain customers and the capability of wireless
companies, CLECs, cable television companies, VoIP providers, electric utilities
and others to provide competitive LEC services. Competition relating to
traditional LEC services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater
extent than the less dense areas in which we operate. We will actively monitor
these developments, observe the effect of emerging competitive trends in larger
markets and continue to evaluate new business opportunities that may arise out
of future technological, legislative and regulatory developments.

We expect
our operating revenues in 2008 to decline as we continue to experience downward
pressure primarily due to continued access line losses, reduced network access
revenues and lower prior year revenue settlement amounts.   We
expect such declines to be partially offset primarily due to increased demand
for our high-speed Internet service offering and the impact of recognizing a
full year of revenues associated with our Madison River properties acquired in
April 2007.

Regulation
and Competition Relating to Other Operations

Long Distance
Operations

.  We offer intra-LATA, intrastate and interstate
long distance services.  State public service commissions generally
regulate intra-LATA toll calls within the same LATA and inter-LATA toll calls
between different LATAs located in the same state.  Federal regulators
have jurisdiction over interstate toll calls.  Recent state regulatory
changes have increased competition to provide intra-LATA toll services in our
local exchange markets.  Competition for intrastate and interstate
long distance services has been intense for several years, and focuses primarily
on price and pricing plans, and secondarily on customer service, reliability and
communications quality.  Traditionally, our principal competitors for
providing long distance services were large long distance companies such as
AT&T, regional phone companies and dial-around
resellers.  Increasingly, however, we have experienced competition
from newer sources, including wireless companies offering attractively-priced
calling plans.  Technological substitutions, including VoIP and
electronic mail, have further reduced demand for traditional long distance
services.  To counter such competition, we now offer unlimited long
distance calling plans.

Data
Operations

.  In connection with our data business, we face
competition from Internet service providers, satellite companies, long distance
carriers and cable companies which use wired or wireless technologies to offer
dial-up Internet access services or high-speed broadband services.  As
of December 31, 2007, we believe approximately 60% of our local exchange markets
are overlapped by cable systems offering data services competitive with
ours.  Many of these competitors offer content that we cannot
match.   Moreover, many of these providers have traditionally
been subject to less rigorous regulatory scrutiny than our subsidiaries,
although recent FCC rule changes classifying our high-speed offering as an
“information service” has helped reduce regulatory disparities.  These
recent rule changes further provided companies the option to deregulate (for
price cap companies) or detariff (for rate of return companies) high-speed
Internet services.  During 2006, all of our operating companies
elected to either deregulate or detariff their high-speed Internet services,
which decreased regulatory oversight and increased our retail pricing
flexibility.

Fiber Transport
Operations

.  When our fiber transport networks are used to
provide intrastate telecommunications services, we must comply with state
requirements for telecommunications utilities, including state tariffing
requirements.  To the extent our facilities are used to provide
interstate communications, we are subject to federal regulation as a
non-dominant common carrier.  Due largely to excess capacity, the
fiber transport industry is highly competitive.  Our primary
competitors are from other communications companies, many of whom operate
networks and have resources much larger than ours.   Over the
last few years, several large communications companies have merged and have
implemented strategies to transfer a significant portion of their voice and data
traffic from our fiber network to their networks.  We expect this
trend to continue as companies seek opportunities to reduce their
transport-related costs.  In addition, new IP-based services may
enable new entrants to transport data at prices lower than we currently
offer.

CLEC
Operations

.  Competitive local exchange carriers are subject to
certain reporting and other regulatory requirements by the FCC and state public
service commissions, although the degree of regulation is much less substantial
than that imposed on ILECs operating in the same markets.  Local
governments also frequently require competitive local exchange carriers to
obtain licenses or franchises regulating the use of rights-of-way necessary to
install and operate their networks.  In each of our CLEC markets, we
face competition from the ILEC, which traditionally has long-standing
relationships with its customers.  Over time, we may also face
competition from one or more other CLECs, or from other communications providers
who can provide comparable services.

Other
Operations

.  Similar to our CLEC business, we may be required
to obtain licenses or franchises to enter new markets for our switched digital
television and wireless broadband services, which could delay our rollout of
these offerings.  The television and wireless communications markets
we have recently entered are highly competitive, which could limit our ability
to compete effectively.

OTHER
DEVELOPMENTS OR MATTERS

In August
2007, our board of directors approved a $750 million stock repurchase program
which expires in September 2009, unless extended by the
board.  Through December 31, 2007, we had repurchased approximately
3.6 million shares for $158.5 million under this program.  We
previously repurchased approximately $401.0 million, $186.7 million, $437.5
million and $1.028 billion of our shares under separate repurchase programs
approved in February 2004, February 2005, May 2005 and February 2006,
respectively.  For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital
Resources included in Item 7 of this annual report.

We have
certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the
protection of the environment.  Costs of compliance through 2007 have
not been material and we currently have no reason to believe that such costs
will become material.

For
additional information concerning our business and properties, see

RISK
FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

Risk
Factors

Any of
the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or
prospects.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing
us.  Please be aware that additional risks and uncertainties not
currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also
materially and adversely affect our business operations.

Risks
Related to Our Business

If
we continue to experience access line losses like we have in the past several
years, our revenues, earnings and cash flows may be adversely
impacted.

Our
business generates a substantial portion of its revenues by delivering voice and
data services over access lines.  We have experienced access line
losses over the past several years, including a 5.7% decline during the year
ended December 31, 2007 (exclusive of the Madison River acquisition), due to a
number of factors, including increased competition and wireless and broadband
substitution, which are described further below.  We expect to
continue to experience access line losses in our markets for an unforeseen
period of time.  Our inability to retain access lines could adversely
impact our revenues, earnings and cash flow from operations.

We
face competition, which we expect to intensify.

As a
result of various technological, regulatory and other changes, the
telecommunications industry has become increasingly competitive, and we expect
these trends to continue.   In our LEC markets, we face
competition from wireless telephone services, which we expect to increase if
wireless providers continue to expand and improve their network coverage, offer
fixed-rate calling plans, lower their prices and offer enhanced
services.  In certain of our LEC markets, we also face competition
from cable television operators, CLECs and VoIP providers.  Over time,
we expect to face additional local exchange competition from more recent market
entrants, including (i) electric utility and satellite communications providers
and (ii) alternative networks or non-carrier systems designed to reduce demand
for our switching or access services.  The Internet, long distance and
data services markets are also highly competitive, and we expect that
competition will intensify in these and other markets that we
serve.  The recent proliferation of companies offering integrated
service offerings has further intensified competition in the markets we
serve.

We expect
competition to intensify as a result of new competitors and the development of
new products and services. Our competitive position could be weakened by
strategic alliances or consolidation within the communications industry or the
development of new technologies.  We cannot predict which future
products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or
what funding will be required to develop and provide these products or services.
Our ability to compete successfully will depend on how well we market our
products and services and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various
competitive and technological factors affecting the industry, including changes
in regulation (which may affect us differently from our competitors), changes in
consumer preferences or demographics, and changes in the product offerings or
pricing strategies of our competitors.

Many of
our current and potential competitors have market presence, engineering,
technical and marketing capabilities and financial, personnel and other
resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of our competitors
own larger and more diverse networks, can conduct operations or raise capital at
a lower cost than we can, are subject to less regulation, have lower benefit
plan costs, offer greater online content services, or have substantially
stronger brand names. Consequently, some competitors may be better equipped than
us to charge lower prices for their products and services, to provide more
attractive offerings, to develop and expand their communications and network
infrastructures more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements, and to devote greater
resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services.

Competition
could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers
and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage of our
services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii) reduced traffic on our
networks, (iv) our need to expend substantial time or money on new capital
improvement projects, (v) our need to lower prices or increase marketing
expenses to remain competitive and (vi) our inability to diversify by
successfully offering new products or services.

We
could be harmed by rapid changes in technology.

The
communications industry is experiencing significant technological changes,
particularly in the areas of VoIP, data transmission and wireless
communications.  Several large electric utilities have announced plans
to offer communications services that will compete with LECs.  Some of
our competitors may enjoy network advantages that will enable them to provide
services more efficiently or at lower cost.  Rapid changes in
technology could result in the development of additional products or services
that compete with or displace those offered by traditional LECs, or that enable
current customers to reduce or bypass use of our networks.  We cannot
predict with certainty which technological changes will provide the greatest
threat to our competitive position.  We may not be able to obtain
timely access to new technology on satisfactory terms or incorporate new
technology into our systems in a cost effective manner, or at all.  If
we cannot develop new products to keep pace with technological advances, or if
such products are not widely embraced by our customers, we could be adversely
impacted.

We
cannot assure you that our diversification efforts will be
successful.

Due to
the above-cited changes, the telephone industry has recently experienced a
decline in access lines and intrastate minutes of use.  This decline
in access lines and usage, coupled with the other changes resulting from
competitive, technological and regulatory developments, could materially
adversely affect our core business and future prospects. Exclusive of the
Madison River acquisition, our access lines declined 5.7% in 2007.  Based
on our planned results for recent sales and retention initiatives, we are
targeting our access line loss to be between 4.5% and 6.0% in
2008.  We also earned less intrastate revenues in 2007 due to
reductions in intrastate minutes of use (partially due to the displacement of
minutes of use by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling
services).  We believe our intrastate minutes of use will continue to
decline, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain.

We have
traditionally sought growth largely through acquisitions of properties similar
to those currently operated by us.  However, we cannot assure you that
properties will be available for purchase on terms attractive to us,
particularly if they are burdened by regulations, pricing plans or competitive
pressures that are new or different from those historically applicable to our
incumbent properties.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to arrange additional financing on terms acceptable to us or to obtain
timely federal and state governmental approvals on terms acceptable to us, or at
all.

In recent
years, we have attempted to broaden our services and products by offering
satellite television services and reselling wireless services as part of our
bundled product and service offerings.  Our reliance on other
companies and their networks to provide these services could constrain our
flexibility and limit the profitability of these new offerings.  In
addition, during 2005 we launched our facilities-based digital video offering to
select markets in Wisconsin and, in October 2007, we launched a second switched
digital video offering in our Columbia, Missouri market.  We may
initiate other new service or product offerings in the future.  We
anticipate new offerings will generate lower profit margins than many of our
traditional services.  As such, to the extent revenues from these new
offerings replace revenues lost from declines in our traditional LEC business,
our overall profit margins will decline.  We cannot assure you that
our recent or future diversification efforts will be successful.

Future
deterioration in our financial performance could adversely impact our credit
ratings, our cost of capital and our access to the capital markets.

Our
future results will suffer if we do not effectively adjust to changes in our
industry.

The
above-described changes in our industry have placed a higher premium on
marketing, technological, engineering and provisioning skills.  Our
future success depends, in part, on our ability to retrain our staff to acquire
or strengthen these skills, and, where necessary, to attract and retain new
personnel that possess these skills.

Our
future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded
operations.

In the
past several years, we have expanded our operations through acquisitions and new
product and service offerings, some of which involve complex technical,
engineering, and operational challenges.  We may pursue similar
opportunities in the future.  Our future success depends, in part,
upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, including our ability
to:

·

retain
      and attract key personnel that have the skills necessary to implement and
      manage the new business
opportunities

·

effectively
      manage our day to day operations while attempting to execute our strategy
      of expanding our business

·

realize
      the projected growth and revenue targets developed by management for our
      newly acquired and emerging businesses,
and

·

continue
      to identify new acquisition or growth opportunities that we can finance,
      consummate and operate on attractive
terms.

Expansion opportunities pose
substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations into our existing
business in an efficient and timely manner, to successfully monitor our
operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and to maintain
other necessary internal controls.  In addition, acquisitions entail
the additional risk that we will incur unanticipated liabilities or
contingencies of the acquired business, unbudgeted expenses or the loss of key
employees or customers.  We cannot assure you that our expansion or
acquisition opportunities will be successful, or that we will realize our
expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies
or other benefits.  If we are not able to meet these challenges
effectively, our

results
of operations may be harmed.

Network
disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.

To be
successful, we will need to continue providing our customers with a high
capacity, reliable and secure network.  Some of the risks to our
network and infrastructure include:

·

power
      losses or physical damage to our access lines, whether caused by fire,
      adverse weather conditions, terrorism or
  otherwise

·

capacity
      limitations

·

software
      and hardware defects

·

breaches
      of security, including sabotage, tampering, computer viruses and
      break-ins, and

·

other
      disruptions that are beyond our
control.

Disruptions
or system failures may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for
customers.  If service is not restored in a timely manner, agreements
with our customers or service standards set by state regulatory commissions
could obligate us to provide credits or other remedies, and this would reduce
our revenues or increase our costs.  Service disruptions could also
damage our reputation with customers, causing us to lose existing customers or
have difficulty attracting new ones.

Any
failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure could harm
our business.

The
capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and
software infrastructure (including our billing systems) is important to the
operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system
failures.  Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information
technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs are
important to the continued implementation of our new service offering
initiatives.  Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology
infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed
implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions, and
the diversion of development resources.

We
rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors to operate our
business.

We depend
on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating
to our network infrastructure.  If these suppliers experience
interruptions or other problems delivering or servicing these network components
on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly.  To the
extent that proprietary technology of a supplier is an integral component of our
network, we may have limited flexibility to purchase key network components from
alternative suppliers.  We also rely on a limited number of other
communications companies in connection with reselling long distance, wireless
and satellite entertainment services to our customers.  In addition,
we rely on a limited number of software vendors to support our business
management systems.  In the event it becomes necessary to seek
alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory
replacement supplies or services on economically attractive terms, on a timely
basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our
services.

Portions
of our property, plant and equipment are located on property owned by third
parties.

Over the
past few years, certain utilities, cooperatives and municipalities in certain of
the states in which we operate have requested significant rate increases for
attaching our plant to their facilities.   To the extent that
these entities are successful in increasing the amount we pay for these
attachments, our future operating costs will increase.

In
addition, we rely on rights-of-way, co-location agreements and other
authorizations granted by governmental bodies and other third parties to locate
our cable, conduit and other network equipment on their respective
properties.  If any of these authorizations terminate or lapse, our
operations could be adversely affected.

Our
relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations
and their financial difficulties may adversely affect us.

We
originate and terminate calls for long distance carriers and other interexchange
carriers over our network in exchange for access charges that represent a
significant portion of our revenues.  Should these carriers go
bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties, our inability to
timely collect access charges from them could have a negative effect on our
business and results of operations.

In
addition, our LightCore operations carry a significant amount of voice and data
traffic for larger communications companies.  As these larger
communications companies consolidate or expand their networks, it is possible
that they could transfer a significant portion of this traffic from our fiber
network to their networks, which could have a negative effect on our business
and results of operations.

We
depend on key members of our senior management team.

Our
success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of a limited
number of senior officers, none of whom are parties to employment
agreements.  Competition for senior management in our industry is
intense and we may have difficulty retaining our current senior managers or
attracting new ones in the event of terminations or resignations.

We
could be affected by certain changes in labor matters.

At
December 31, 2007, approximately 25% of our employees were members of 15
separate bargaining units represented by two different unions.  From
time to time, our labor agreements with these unions lapse, and we typically
negotiate the terms of new agreements.   We cannot predict the
outcome of these negotiations.  We may be unable to reach new
agreements, and union employees may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other
labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide
services.  In addition, new labor agreements may impose significant
new costs on us, which could impair our financial condition or results of
operations in the future.  Moreover, our post-employment benefit
offerings cause us to incur costs not faced by many of our competitors, which
could ultimately hinder our competitive position.

Risks
Related to Our Regulatory Environment

Our
revenues could be materially reduced or our expenses materially increased by
changes in regulations.

The
majority of our revenues are substantially dependent upon regulations which, if
changed, could result in material revenue reductions.  Laws and
regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been,
challenged in the courts, and could be changed by federal or state
legislators.  Any of the following could significantly impact
us:

Risk of loss or reduction of network
access charge revenues.

A significant portion of our network
access revenues are paid to us by intrastate and interstate long distance
carriers for originating and terminating calls in the regions we
serve.  The amount of access charge revenues that we receive is based
largely on rates set by federal and state regulatory bodies, and such rates
could change.  The FCC is currently weighing several proposals to
comprehensively reform the intercarrier compensation regime in order to create a
uniform system of intercarrier payments.  Any reform eventually
adopted by the FCC will likely involve significant changes in the access charge
system and could potentially result in a significant decrease or elimination of
access charges altogether.  In addition, our financial results could
be harmed if carriers that use our access services become financially distressed
or bypass our networks, either due to changes in regulation or other
factors.  Furthermore, access charges currently paid to us could be
diverted to competitors who enter our markets or expand their operations, either
due to changes in regulation or otherwise.

Risk of loss or reduction of support
fund payments.

We receive a substantial portion of our
revenues from the federal Universal Service Fund and, to a lesser extent,
intrastate support funds.  These governmental programs are reviewed
and amended from time to time, and we cannot assure you that they will not be
changed or impacted in a manner adverse to us.  In August 2004, a
federal-state joint board requested comments on the FCC’s current rules for
high-cost support payments to rural telephone companies, including comments on
whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would
adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us.  In May 2007, this
board proposed that the FCC consider an interim cap on the amount of the
high-cost support that competitive eligible telecommunications carriers may
receive.  Several parties have objected to the size of the USF or
questioned the continued need to maintain the program in its current
form.  Pending judicial appeals and Congressional proposals create
additional uncertainty regarding our future receipt of support
payments.  We cannot estimate the impact that these developments will
have on us.

We expect
our 2008 high cost support fund revenues to be approximately $14 to $17 million
lower than 2007 due to (i) an expected increase in the nationwide average cost
per loop factor and (ii) an expected decline in the overall size of the high
cost support fund.  In addition, the number of eligible
telecommunications carriers receiving support payments from this program
continues to increase, which, coupled with other factors, has placed additional
financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to
provide support payments to all eligible recipients, including us.

Risk of loss of statutory exemption
from burdensome interconnection rules imposed on incumbent local exchange
carriers

.  Affiliates of ours operating approximately half of
our telephone access lines are exempt from the 1996 Act’s more burdensome
requirements governing the rights of competitors to interconnect to incumbent
local exchange carrier networks and to utilize discrete network elements of the
incumbent’s network at favorable rates.  If state regulators decide
that it is in the public’s interest to impose these more burdensome
interconnection requirements on us, these affiliates would be required to
provide unbundled network elements to competitors.  As a result, more
competitors could enter our traditional telephone markets than we currently
expect, resulting in lower revenues and higher additional administrative and
regulatory expenses.

Risk of losses from rate
reductions

.  Notwithstanding the movement toward alternative
state regulation, LECs operating approximately 28% of our total access lines
continue to be subject to “rate of return” regulation for intrastate
purposes.  These LECs remain subject to the powers of state regulatory
commissions to conduct earnings reviews and adjust service rates, which could
lead to revenue reductions.  LECs governed by alternative regulatory
plans could also under certain circumstances be ordered to reduce rates or could
experience rate reductions following the lapse of plans currently in
effect.

The FCC
regulates tariffs for interstate access and subscriber line charges, both of
which are components of our revenues.  As noted above, the FCC
currently is considering proposals to reduce interstate access charges for
carriers like us.  We could be adversely affected if the FCC lowers or
eliminates interstate access charges without adopting an adequate revenue
replacement mechanism.

Risks posed by costs of regulatory
compliance

.  Regulations continue to create significant
compliance costs for us.  Challenges to our tariffs by regulators or
third parties or delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals
could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and, if
successful, such challenges could adversely affect the rates that we are able to
charge our customers.  Our business also may be impacted by
legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to
assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland security, minimizing
environmental impacts, or addressing other issues that impact our business
(including local number portability and customer proprietary network information
requirements).  For example, existing provisions of the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act require communications carriers to ensure
that their equipment, facilities, and services are able to facilitate authorized
electronic surveillance.  We expect our compliance costs to increase
if future legislation or regulations continue to increase our obligations to
assist other governmental agencies.

Regulatory
changes in the communications industry could adversely affect our business by
facilitating greater competition against us.

The 1996
Act provides for significant changes and increased competition in the
communications industry, including the local communications and long distance
industries.  This Act and the FCC’s implementing regulations remain
subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus making it difficult
to predict what effect the legislation will ultimately have on us and our
competitors.  Several regulatory and judicial proceedings have
recently concluded, are underway or may soon be commenced, which address issues
affecting our operations and those of our competitors.  Moreover,
certain communities nationwide have expressed an interest in establishing a
municipal telephone utility that would compete for customers.  We
cannot predict the outcome of these developments, nor can we assure that these
changes will not have a material adverse effect on us or our
industry.

We
are subject to significant regulations that limit our flexibility.

As a
diversified full service incumbent local exchange carrier, or ILEC, we have
traditionally been subject to significant regulation that does not apply to many
of our competitors.  For instance, unlike many of our competitors, we
are subject to federal mandates to share facilities, file and justify tariffs,
maintain certain accounts and file reports, and state requirements that obligate
us to maintain service standards and limit our ability to change tariffs in a
timely manner.  This regulation imposes substantial compliance costs
on us and restricts our ability to change rates, to compete and to respond
rapidly to changing industry conditions.  Although newer alternative
forms of regulation permit us greater freedoms in several states in which we
operate, they nonetheless typically impose caps on the rates that we can charge
our customers.  As our business becomes increasingly competitive,
regulatory disparities between us and our competitors could impede our ability
to compete.  Litigation and different objectives among federal and
state regulators could create uncertainty and impede our ability to respond to
new regulations.  Moreover, changes in tax laws, regulations or
policies could increase our tax rate, particularly if state regulators continue
to search for additional revenue sources to address budget
shortfalls.  We are unable to predict the future actions of the
various regulatory bodies that govern us, but such actions could materially
affect our business.

We
are subject to franchising requirements that could impede our expansion
opportunities.

We may be
required to obtain from municipal authorities operating franchises to install or
expand facilities.  Some of these franchises may require us to pay
franchise fees.  These franchising requirements generally apply to our
fiber transport and CLEC operations, and to our emerging switched digital
television and wireless broadband businesses.  These requirements
could delay us in expanding our operations or increase the costs of providing
these services.

We
will be exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Changing
laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public
disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations implemented
by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, are increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making
some activities more time consuming.  The annual evaluation of our
internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may result
in identifying material weaknesses in our internal
controls.   Any future failure to successfully or timely complete
these annual assessments could subject us to sanctions or investigation by
regulatory authorities.  Any such action could adversely affect our
financial results or investors’ confidence in us, and could cause our stock
price to fall.  If we fail to maintain effective controls and
procedures, we may be unable to provide financial information in a timely and
reliable manner, which could in certain instances limit our ability to borrow or
raise capital.

For a
more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business,
see “Operations” above.

Other
Risks

We
have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may need to incur more in the
future.

We have a
substantial amount of indebtedness , which could have material adverse
consequences for us, including (i) hindering our ability to adjust to changing
market, industry or economic conditions; (ii) limiting our ability to access the
capital markets to refinance maturing debt or to fund acquisitions or emerging
businesses; (iii) limiting the amount of free cash flow available for future
operations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases or other uses; (iv)
making us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest
rate increases; and (v) placing us at a competitive disadvantage to those of our
competitors that have less indebtedness.

In
connection with executing our business strategies, we are continuously
evaluating the possibility of acquiring additional communications assets, and we
may elect to finance acquisitions by incurring additional
indebtedness.  Moreover, to respond to the competitive challenges
discussed above, we may be required to raise substantial additional capital to
finance new product or service offerings.  Our ability to arrange
additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position
and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors
beyond our control.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to
obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.  If
we are able to obtain additional financing, our credit ratings could be
adversely affected.  As a result, our borrowing costs would likely
increase, our access to capital may be adversely affected and our ability to
satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness could be adversely
affected.

As
a holding company, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our
obligations.

As a
holding company, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is
dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those
earnings to, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to,
us.  As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate the funds
necessary to meet our obligations, including the payment of amounts owed under
our long-term debt.  Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal
entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us or, subject to
limited exceptions for tax-sharing purposes, to make any funds available to us
to repay our obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other
payments.  Certain of our subsidiaries may be restricted under loan
agreements or regulatory orders from transferring funds to us, including certain
loan provisions that restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid to
us.  Moreover, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary upon its
liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of
creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors.  The
footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein
describe these matters in additional detail.

Our
agreements and organizational documents and applicable law could limit another
party’s ability to acquire us.

Under our
articles of incorporation, each share of common stock that has been beneficially
owned by the same person or entity continually since May 30, 1987 generally
entitles the holder to ten votes on all matters duly submitted to a vote of
shareholders. As of January 31, 2008, we estimate that the holders of our
ten-vote shares held approximately 26% of our total voting power. Our articles
also provide for a classified board of directors, which limits the ability of an
insurgent to rapidly replace the board.  In addition, a number of
other provisions in our agreements and organizational documents and various
provisions of applicable law may delay, defer or prevent a future takeover of
CenturyTel unless the takeover is approved by our board of
directors.  This could deprive our shareholders of any related
takeover premium.

We
face other risks.

The list
of risks above is not exhaustive, and you should be aware that we face various
other risks.  For a description of additional risks, please see
“Operations” above, “Forward-Looking Statements” below, and the other items of
this annual report, particularly Items 3, 7 and 8.

Legal
      Proceedings.

In

Barbrasue Beattie and James
Sovis, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, v. CenturyTel,
Inc.

, filed on October 28, 2002, in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan (Case No. 02-10277), the plaintiffs allege that
we unjustly and unreasonably billed customers for inside wire maintenance
services, and seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief under
various legal theories on behalf of a purported class of over two million
customers in our telephone markets.  On March 10, 2006, the Court
certified a class of plaintiffs and issued a ruling that the billing
descriptions we used for these services during an approximately 18-month period
between October 2000 and May 2002 were legally insufficient.  Our
appeal of this class certification decision was denied.  Our
preliminary analysis indicates that we billed less than $10 million for inside
wire maintenance services under the billing descriptions and time periods
specified in the District Court ruling described above.  Should other
billing descriptions be determined to be inadequate or if claims are allowed for
additional time periods, the amount of our potential exposure could increase
significantly.  The Court’s order does not specify the award of
damages, the scope and amounts of which, if any, remain subject to additional
fact-finding and resolution of what we believe are valid defenses to plaintiff’s
claims.  Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount or
range of possible loss at this time.  However, considering the
one-time nature of any adverse result, we do not believe that the ultimate
outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or on-going results of operations.

From time
to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business,
including administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating
primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, occasional
grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies, proceedings by or against
taxing authorities, and miscellaneous third party tort
actions.   The outcome of these other proceedings is not
predictable.  However, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution
of these other proceedings, after considering available insurance coverage, will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

repurchase agreements with certain investment banks at an initial average price
of $34.83.  The investment banks completed their repurchases in
mid-July 2006 and in connection therewith we paid an aggregate of approximately
$28.4 million cash to the investment banks to compensate them for the difference
between their weighted average purchase price during the repurchase period and
the initial average price.  We repurchased the remaining $500 million
of common stock of this program in open-market transactions through June
2007.

In August
2007, our board of directors authorized a $750 million share repurchase program
which expires on September 30, 2009, unless extended by the

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

CenturyTel,
Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company
engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services, including
local and long distance voice, Internet access and broadband services, to
customers in 25 states.  We currently derive our revenues from
providing (i) local exchange and long distance voice services, (ii) network
access services, (iii) data services, which includes both high-speed (“DSL”) and
dial-up Internet services, as well as special access and private line services,
(iv) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security monitoring
services and (v) other related services.

On April
30, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Madison River
Communications Corp. (“Madison River”).  See Note 2 for additional
information.  We have reflected the results of operations of the
Madison River properties in our consolidated results of operations beginning May
1, 2007.  On June 30, 2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16
metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. (“KMC”) for approximately
$75.5 million cash and have reflected the results of operations of KMC in our
consolidated results of operations beginning July 1, 2005.

During
2007, we recognized approximately $49.0 million of network access revenues in
connection with the settlement of a dispute with a carrier and approximately
$42.2 million of revenues in connection with the lapse of a regulatory
monitoring period (of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network
access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data
revenues).  Neither of these favorable revenue items in 2007 are
expected to reoccur in the future.

Effective
January 1, 2007, we changed our relationship with our provider of satellite
television service from a revenue sharing arrangement to an agency relationship
and, in connection therewith, we received in the second quarter of 2007 a
non-recurring reimbursement of $5.9 million, of which $4.1 million was reflected
as a reduction of cost of services (which we previously incurred as subscriber
acquisition costs) and the remainder was reflected as revenues.  This
change has also resulted in us recognizing lower recurring revenues and lower
recurring operating costs compared to our prior arrangement.

In
September 2007, we announced a reduction of our workforce to be completed by
mid-2008 of approximately 200 jobs and, in connection therewith, incurred a net
pre-tax charge of approximately $2.2 million (consisting of a $2.7 million
charge to operating expenses, net of a $527,000 favorable revenue impact related
to such expenses as allowed through our rate-making process) for severance and
related costs.  On March 1 and August 31, 2006, we announced workforce
reductions involving an aggregate of approximately 400 jobs and, in connection
therewith, incurred an aggregate net pre-tax charge of approximately $7.5
million (consisting of a $9.4 million charge to operating expenses, net of a
$1.9 million favorable revenue impact related to such expenses as allowed
through our rate-making process) for severance and related
costs.    See Note 8 for additional
information.

In the fourth quarter of 2007,
we recorded a $16.6 million pre-tax impairment charge in order to write-down the
value of certain long-lived assets in certain of our CLEC markets to their
estimated realizable value.  The estimated realizable value was
determined based on current proposals received during our sales process of such
properties.

In the
third quarter of 2007, we recorded a one-time pre-tax gain of approximately
$10.4 million related to the sale of our interest in a real estate
partnership.  In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded a one-time
pre-tax gain of approximately $117.8 million upon redemption of our investment
in the stock of the Rural Telephone Bank (“RTB”).   Subsequently,
in the fourth quarter of 2007, upon final distribution of the remaining proceeds
from the RTB dissolution, we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $5.2
million.  See Note 15 for additional information.

Our net income for 2007 was $418.4 million, compared to $370.0 million during
2006 and $334.5 million during 2005.  Diluted earnings per share for
2007 was $3.72 compared to $3.07 in 2006 and $2.49 in 2005.  The
number of average diluted shares outstanding declined 7.5% in 2007 and 10.2% in
2006 primarily due to our share repurchases during the past three
years.

Operating
income increased $127.5 million in 2007 as a $208.5 million increase in
operating revenues was partially offset by an $81.0 million increase in
operating expenses. Operating income decreased $70.9 million in 2006 due to a
$31.5 million decrease in operating revenues and a $39.3 million increase in
operating expenses.

In addition to historical
information, this management’s discussion and analysis includes certain
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are
subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are
beyond our control.  Actual events and results may differ materially
from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or
uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove
incorrect.  Factors that could affect actual results include but are
not limited to:  the timing, success and overall effects of
competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in
rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of
the communications industry; our ability to effectively manage our expansion
opportunities, including successfully integrating newly-acquired businesses into
our operations and retaining and  hiring key personnel; possible
changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability
to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and
cost-effective basis; our continued access to credit markets on favorable terms;
our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications
companies; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining
agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse
weather; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more
general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting
policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general
market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public
policy.

These and other uncertainties
related to our business are described in greater detail in Item 1A included
herein. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it
is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the
impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or
more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any
forward-looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward-looking
statements for any reason.

During
2007 and 2005, we recognized revenues of approximately $42.2 million and $35.9
million, respectively, related to the expiration of regulatory monitoring
periods.  Of the $42.2 million recognized in 2007, approximately $25.4
million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected
in data revenues.  Of the $35.9 million recognized in 2005,
approximately $24.5 million is reflected in network access revenues and
approximately $11.4 million is reflected in data revenues.  In
addition, in 2007 we recognized approximately $49.0 million of revenues related
to the settlement of a dispute with a carrier.  We do not expect this
level of favorable revenue settlements to reoccur in the future.

Revenues
from voice mail services previously reflected in “other” revenues have been
reclassified to “voice” revenues for all periods presented.

Voice  revenues.

We derive voice revenues by providing local exchange
telephone services and retail long distance services to customers in our service
areas.  The $18.2 million (2.1%) increase in voice revenues in 2007 is
primarily due to $43.3 million of revenues attributable to the Madison River
properties acquired April 30, 2007.  Such increase was partially
offset by (i) a $20.7 million decrease due to a 5.2% decline in the average
number of access lines (normalized for acquisitions, dispositions and
previously-disclosed adjustments made during 2006) and (ii) a $6.0 million
decline as a result of a decrease in revenues associated with extended area
calling plans.

The $30.7
million (3.4%) decrease in voice revenues in 2006 is primarily due to (i) a
$22.3 million decrease due a 4.8% decline in the average number of access lines
served and (ii) a $26.1 million decline as a result of a decrease in minutes of
use in extended area calling plans in certain areas.  Such decreases
were partially offset by (i) a $12.6 million increase in long distance revenues
primarily attributable to an increase in the number of long distance lines and
increased long distance minutes of use, both of which were partially offset by a
decline in the average rate we charged our long distance customers, and (ii) a
$9.9 million increase due to providing custom calling features to more
customers.

Normalized
for the adjustments mentioned above, access lines declined 119,700 (5.7%) during
2007 compared to a decline of 107,000 (4.8%) during 2006.  We believe
the decline in the number of access lines during 2007 and 2006 is primarily due
to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other
competitive services.  Based on our planned results for recent sales
and retention initiatives, we are targeting our access line loss to be between
4.5% and 6.0% in 2008.

Network access
revenues.

We derive our network access revenues primarily from
(i) providing services to various carriers and customers in connection with the
use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate
voice transmissions and (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us
to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery
mechanisms.  Certain of our interstate network access revenues are
based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications
Commission (“FCC”); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue
sharing arrangements with other local exchange carriers (“LECs”) administered by
the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues
are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are
derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs.

Network access revenues increased $62.8 million (7.1%) in 2007 and decreased
$81.1 million (8.5%) in 2006 due to the following factors:

In March
2006, we filed a complaint against a carrier for recovery of unpaid and
underpaid access charges for calls made using the carrier’s prepaid calling
cards and calls that used Internet Protocol for a portion of their
transmission.  The carrier filed a counterclaim against us, asserting
that we improperly billed them terminating intrastate access charges on certain
wireless roaming traffic.  In April 2007, we entered into a settlement
agreement with the carrier and received approximately $49 million cash from them
related to the issues described above.   This amount is reflected
in our 2007 results of operations as a component of “Network access”
revenues.

In third
quarter 2007, upon the lapse of the applicable 2003/2004 monitoring period for
certain of our tariffed billings, we recognized approximately $42.2 million of
revenues (of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access
revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues).  Such
amount represented billings from tariffs prior to July 2004 in excess of the
authorized rate of return that we initially recorded as a deferred credit
pending completion of such 2003/2004 monitoring period.

Our
revenues from the Universal Service High Cost Loop Fund increased approximately
$2.2 million in 2007 after decreasing $11.6 million in 2006.  Such
decrease in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in the nationwide average cost
per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds among all
recipients.  We anticipate our 2008 revenues from the federal
Universal Service High Cost Loop support program will decrease between $14 and
$17 million compared to 2007.

In 2007
and 2006, we experienced reductions in our intrastate revenues of approximately
$20.9 million and $19.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in
intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless,
electronic mail and other optional calling services).   We
believe that intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2008, although we
cannot estimate the magnitude of such decrease.

Data revenues

.  We
derive our data revenues primarily by providing Internet access services (both
DSL and dial-up services) and data transmission services over special circuits
and private lines.   Data revenues in 2007 increased $109.3
million (31.1%) substantially due to (i) a $66.4 million increase in DSL-related
revenues due primarily to growth in the number of DSL customers; (ii) $34.5
million of revenues contributed by Madison River and (iii) $16.8 million of
one-time revenues recorded in third quarter 2007 upon expiration of the
above-described regulatory monitoring period.  Such increases were
partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in special access revenues primarily
due to certain customers disconnecting circuits and a $5.1 million decrease in
dial-up Internet revenues due to a decline in the number of dial-up
customers.

Data
revenues increased $32.7 million (10.3%) in 2006, substantially due to a $54.0
million increase in DSL-related revenues primarily due to growth in the number
of high-speed Internet customers.  Such increase was partially offset
by a decrease in prior year revenue settlements due to the above-described
recognition of approximately $11.4 million of revenues in third quarter 2005
upon the lapse of a regulatory monitoring period and a $4.9 million decrease due
to a reduced number of dial-up Internet customers.

Fiber transport and
CLEC.

Our fiber transport and CLEC revenues include
revenues from our fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”)
and security monitoring businesses.  Fiber transport and CLEC revenues
increased $10.2 million (6.9%) in 2007, of which $8.7 million was due to growth
in our incumbent fiber transport business and $4.8 million was contributed by
Madison River.  Such increases were partially offset by a $3.5 million
decrease in CLEC revenues primarily due to customer disconnects.

Fiber
transport and CLEC revenues increased $33.6 million (29.1%) in 2006, of which
$24.4 million was due to revenues from the fiber assets acquired on June 30,
2005 from KMC and $8.5 million was attributable to growth in our incumbent fiber
transport business.

Other revenues.

We
derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and
maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii)
providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating
in the publication of local directories and (iv) providing new service
offerings, principally consisting of our new video and wireless reseller
services.  Other revenues increased $8.0 million (4.1%) in
2007.  Such increase was primarily due to $13.9 million of revenues
contributed by Madison River.   In connection with receiving a
one-time reimbursement as a result of our above-described change in our
contractual relationship with our satellite television service provider, we
recorded a $1.9 million one-time increase to revenues in 2007. The impact of the
change in the arrangement from a gross to a net revenue presentation resulted in
an $8.2 million decrease in recurring revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.

Other
revenues increased $14.0 million (7.7%) during 2006 primarily due to a $12.1
million increase in revenues of our video and wireless reseller offerings and a
$2.5 million increase in directory revenues.

our Madison River properties; (ii) a $20.9 million increase in DSL-related
expenses due to growth in the number of DSL customers; (iii) a $16.6 million
impairment charge related to certain of our CLEC assets that we expect to sell
in the near term; and (iv) a $7.8 million increase in expenses associated with
pole attachments primarily due to rate increases.  Such increases were
partially offset by (i) a $33.1 million decrease in salaries and benefits due to
costs associated with workforce reductions in 2006 and due to fewer incumbent
employees resulting from our recent workforce reductions and (ii) a $19.7
million decrease in expenses associated with our satellite television service

high-speed Internet customers; and (v) $8.6 million of severance and related
costs associated with our workforce reduction in 2006 (see Note 8).

Selling, general and
administrative.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $19.3 million (5.2%) in 2007 primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of
costs incurred by Madison River; (ii) an $8.2 million increase in salaries and
benefits; and (iii) a $5.6 million increase in sales and marketing
expenses.  Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $5.7 million
reduction in bad debt expense and (ii) a $4.3 million decrease in information
technology expenses.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased $18.7 million (4.8%) in 2006
primarily due to an $11.0 million decrease in marketing expenses; a $10.6
million reduction in information technology expenses; an $8.7 million reduction
in bad debt expense; and a $5.8 million decrease in operating
taxes.  These decreases were partially offset by a $9.9 million
increase in salaries and benefits and a $5.5 million increase in expenses
incurred from the properties acquired from KMC.

Depreciation and
amortization

.  Depreciation and amortization increased $12.7
million (2.4%) in 2007 primarily due to $32.5 million of depreciation and
amortization incurred by Madison River and a $14.8 million increase due to
higher levels of plant in service.  Such increases were substantially
offset by a $31.7 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain
assets becoming fully depreciated.

Depreciation
and amortization decreased $8.4 million (1.6%) in 2006, primarily due to a $25.3
million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully
depreciated.  Such decrease was partially offset by (i) a $16.6
million increase due to higher levels of plant in service and (ii) a $3.1
million increase due to depreciation and amortization of the properties acquired
from KMC.

impact our operations, see “Regulation and Competition”.

INTEREST
EXPENSE

Interest
expense increased $16.9 million (8.6%) in 2007 compared to 2006.  A
$22.7 million increase due to increased average debt outstanding (primarily due
to the $750 million of senior notes issued in March 2007 to fund the Madison
River acquisition) was partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease due to lower
average interest rates.

Interest
expense decreased $5.8 million (2.9%) in 2006 compared to 2005 as a $10.5
million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding was
partially offset by a $7.1 million increase due to higher average interest
rates.

OTHER
INCOME (EXPENSE)

Other
income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related to
our core operations, including gains or losses from nonoperating asset
dispositions and impairments, our share of the income from our 49% interest in a
cellular partnership, interest income and allowance for funds used during
construction.  Other income (expense) was $38.8 million in 2007,
$121.6 million in 2006 and $3.2 million in 2005.  The years 2007, 2006
and 2005 were impacted by certain charges and credits that are not expected to
occur in the future.  The year 2007 include a non-recurring pre-tax
gain of $10.4 million related to the sale of our interest in a real estate
partnership and a $5.2 million pre-tax gain resulting from the final
distribution of funds from the RTB redemption mentioned
below.   Included in 2006 were pre-tax gains of approximately
$118.6 million (substantially all of which related to the redemption of our RTB
stock upon dissolution of the RTB), which was partially offset by pre-tax
charges of approximately $11.7 million due to the impairment of certain
non-operating investments.  Included in 2005 was (i) a $16.2 million
pre-tax charge due to the impairment of a non-operating investment; (ii) a $4.8
million debt extinguishment expense related to purchasing and retiring
approximately $400 million of our Senior J notes; (iii) $3.2 million of
non-recurring interest income related to the settlement of various income tax
audits; and (iv) a $3.5 million gain from the sale of a non-operating
investment.

Our share
of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership increased $8.7 million
in 2007 compared to 2006.  Such increase was partially due to
favorable adjustments recorded in 2007 that resulted from the unaffiliated
general partner completing the audited financial statements of this partnership
for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.  Previously for these
time periods, we had recorded our share of the partnership income based on
unaudited results of operations.

INCOME
TAX EXPENSE

The
effective income tax rate was 32.4%, 37.4%, and 37.8% for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $32.7
million in 2007 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits
(see below and Note 12).   Income tax expense was reduced by
approximately $6.4 million in 2006 due to the resolution of various income tax
audit issues.

Income
tax expense for 2005 was increased by $19.5 million as a result of increasing
the valuation allowance related to net state operating loss
carryforwards.  This increase was primarily due to changes in state
income tax laws and other factors which impacted the projections of future
taxable income.  This tax expense increase was more than offset by (i)
a reduction of state income tax reserves ($11.6 million, net of federal income
tax benefit); (ii) a reduction in our composite state income tax rate due to
more income being apportioned to states with lower state tax rates ($8.5
million); and (iii) the favorable settlement of various federal income tax
audits ($1.3 million).

ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June
2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial
statements.  FIN 48 required us, effective January 1, 2007, to
recognize and measure tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
and disclose uncertainties in income tax positions.  See Note 12 for
additional information related to our income tax uncertainties.

In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS
157”).  SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements
required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements.  SFAS 157
is effective for us beginning January 1, 2008.  We currently do not
expect SFAS 157 to have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”).  SFAS 158
was effective for our December 31, 2006 balance sheet and required us to
recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and
postretirement plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet and to
recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur
through adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss) and to stockholders’
equity, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss.   As a
result of the implementation of SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, our non-current
assets decreased $64.7 million, our current liabilities decreased $898,000, our
non-current liabilities (excluding deferred income taxes) increased
approximately $99.5 million, our deferred income taxes decreased approximately
$65.4 million and our stockholders’ equity (reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive loss) decreased approximately $97.9 million.  See Note 1
for additional information.

In
September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB
108”).  SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected
misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
year financial statements.  SAB 108 requires companies to quantify
misstatements using both a balance sheet approach and income statement approach
and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is
material in light of the relevant quantitative and qualitative
factors.  We adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of
2006.  Upon the implementation of SAB 108, we recognized a net $9.7
million increase to January 1, 2006 retained earnings for the cumulative effect
of correcting prior year uncorrected misstatements.  See Note 1 for
additional information.

On
January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS 143”), which addresses
financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and requires that the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the
long-lived asset.   Although we generally have no legal
obligation to remove obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets
established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation” (“SFAS 71”), have historically included a
component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage
value.  Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us
to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of
salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the
assets.  Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for
our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71.   For these reasons,
the adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial
statements.  For our telephone operations acquired from Verizon in
2002 (which are not subject to SFAS 71) and our other non-regulated operations,
we have not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs related to
tangible long-lived assets through an adjustment to our depreciation rates for
these assets.

On
March 31, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”
(“FIN 47”), an interpretation of SFAS 143.  FIN 47, which was
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, clarifies that the
recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS 143 apply to asset
retirement obligations in which the timing or method of settlement may be
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within control of the
entity. We identified conditional asset retirement obligations for (i) asbestos
removal in buildings, (ii) removal of underground storage tanks, (iii) our
property located on public and private rights-of way and (iv) our property that
is attached to poles owned by other utilities and municipalities.  Due
to a lack of historical experience from which to reasonably estimate a
settlement date or range of settlement dates, we concluded that an asset
retirement obligation associated with our property located on rights-of-way is
indeterminate. We also concluded that our conditional asset retirement
obligations related to the removal of asbestos, underground storage tanks and
our property that is attached to other entities’ poles was immaterial to our
financial condition and results of operations and therefore has not been
recognized.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that
are generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses.  We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions
including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful
accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits, (iv) intangible and
long-lived assets and (v) income taxes.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates and assumptions.  We believe these critical
accounting policies discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment or
complexity.

Revenue
recognition.

Certain of our interstate network access and data
revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the FCC; the
remainder of such revenues is derived from revenue sharing arrangements with
other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association, with the
exception of DSL-related revenues which were removed from our pooled interstate
tariff filing effective July 1, 2006 and are now recognized as revenues when
billed.  During 2004, we began generally recognizing such interstate
network access revenues at the authorized rate of return, unless the actual
achieved or projected rate of return was lower than authorized.

The
Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access
tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those
tariffs lawful.  Tariffs that have been “deemed lawful” in effect
nullify an interexchange carrier’s ability to seek refunds should the earnings
from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of
return prescribed by the FCC.  Certain of our telephone subsidiaries
file interstate tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing
approach.  Since July 2004, we have recognized billings from our
tariffs as revenue since we believe such tariffs are “deemed
lawful”.  There is no assurance that our future tariff filings will be
“deemed lawful”.  For those billings from tariffs prior to July 2004,
we initially recorded as a deferred credit our earnings in excess of the
authorized rate of return.  Upon the lapse of the applicable
regulatory monitoring periods, we recorded approximately $42.2 million as
revenue in 2007 and approximately $35.9 million as revenue in
2005.  We do not expect these favorable revenue settlements to reoccur
in the future.

Allowance for doubtful
accounts

.  In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts
receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customer’s or
carrier’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time
the receivable has been past due and historical collection
experience.  Based on these assessments, we record both specific and
general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related
accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers
and carriers.  If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen
such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, we may need to
increase our reserves from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.

Pension and postretirement
benefits.

The amounts recognized in our financial statements
related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial
basis, which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such
amounts.  A significant assumption used in determining our pension and
postretirement expense is the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets.  For 2007 and 2006, we utilized an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 8.25%, which we believe reflects the expected long-term
rates of return in the financial markets.

Another
assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit
plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate.  Our discount rate
at December 31, 2007 ranged from 6.3-6.5% compared to 5.75-5.80% at December 31,
2006, which we believe is the appropriate rate at which the pension and
postretirement benefits could be effectively settled.  Such rates were
determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash
outflows of our benefit plans.   A 25 basis point decrease in the
assumed discount rate would increase annual combined pension and postretirement
expense approximately $1.7 million.

Intangible and long-lived
assets.

We are subject to testing for impairment of long-lived
assets under two accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”).

SFAS 142
requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for
impairment at least annually and requires write-downs only in periods in which
the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142,
impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting
unit to its carrying value (including goodwill).  Estimates of the
fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques
such as multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and
amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying
value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of
goodwill is compared to its carrying value.  If the implied fair value
of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to
its implied fair value.  We completed the required annual test of
goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2007) under SFAS 142 and determined our
goodwill was not impaired as of such date.

Under
SFAS 144, the carrying value of long-lived assets other than goodwill is
reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such
carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the
carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
generated by the assets.  If the undiscounted net cash flows are less
than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of
the carrying value of a long-lived asset over its fair value.  We
recognized a $16.6 million pre-tax impairment charge in 2007 related to certain
of our CLEC assets that we expect to sell.

Income taxes.

We
estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of the
future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our
financial statements or applicable tax returns.  Actual income taxes
paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or
the resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities.  We
maintain liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax
positions taken in our tax returns.  These liabilities are estimated
based on our judgment of the probable outcome of the uncertain tax positions and
are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and
circumstances.  Changes to the liabilities for unrecognized tax
benefits could materially affect operating results in the period of
change.  During 2007, we released approximately $32.7 million of
previously unrecognized tax benefits (including related interest and net of
federal benefit) in accordance with FIN 48.  Such benefit was recorded
primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of audits, administrative
practices and the lapse of statute of limitations in certain
jurisdictions.  See Note 12 for additional information regarding our
unrecognized tax benefits.

For
additional information on our critical accounting policies, see “Accounting
Pronouncements” and “Regulation and Competition – Other Matters” below, and the
footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
herein.

INFLATION

Historically,
we have mitigated the effects of increased costs by recovering over time certain
costs applicable to our regulated telephone operations through the rate-making
process.  However, LECs operating over 72% of our total access lines
are now governed by state alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict
or delay our ability to recover increased costs.  Additional future
regulatory changes and competitive situations may further alter our ability to
recover increased costs in our regulated operations.   For the
properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price-cap
regulation for interstate purposes, price changes for certain revenue
components are limited to the rate of inflation.   As
operating expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of
inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover the
costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment.

MARKET
RISK

We are
exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long-term debt
obligations.  We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity
analysis.  Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair
value of a fixed-rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in
interest rates.  Fair value of long-term debt obligations is
determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and
maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available
in the long-term financing markets.  The results of the sensitivity
analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual
results may differ from these estimates.

At
December 31, 2007, the fair value of our long-term debt was estimated to be $3.0
billion based on the overall weighted average rate of our long-term debt of 6.6%
and an overall weighted maturity of 8 years compared to terms and rates
available on such date in long-term financing markets.   Market
risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long-term debt
resulting from a hypothetical increase of 66 basis points in interest rates (ten
percent of our overall weighted average borrowing rate).  Such an
increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $106 million decrease
in the fair value of our long-term debt.  As of December 31, 2007,
after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 83%
of our long-term debt obligations were fixed rate.

We seek
to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to
limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in
rates.  From time to time, we use derivative instruments to (i)
lock-in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed
interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for
variable interest rates.  We have established policies and procedures
for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative
instrument activities.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We periodically
review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implement strategies to
manage the exposure.

At
December 31, 2007, we had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges
associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Series L
senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of
7.875%.  These hedges are  “fixed to variable” interest rate
swaps that effectively convert our fixed rate interest payment obligations under
these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six-month
London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 3.229% to the six-month LIBOR plus
3.67%, with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through
the expiration of the hedges in August 2012.  During 2007, we realized
an average interest rate under these hedges of 8.70% and interest expense was
greater than it would have otherwise been by $4.1 million during 2007 as a
result of these hedges.  The aggregate fair market value of these
hedges was $3.0 million at December 31, 2007 and is reflected both as an asset
and as an increase in our underlying long-term debt on the December 31, 2007
balance sheet.  With respect to each of these hedges, market risk is
estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from
a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair
value.  A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result
in a $9.6 million decrease in the fair value of these hedges at December 31,
2007, and would also increase our interest expense.

In third
quarter 2007, we entered into a hedge transaction that effectively locked-in the
interest rate for the six-month period ended February 2008 related to the $500
million of Series L notes that previously were effectively converted to variable
rate notes pursuant to the “fixed to variable” interest rate swaps described
above.  This hedge did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and
therefore is adjusted to its fair value each period (with a corresponding
adjustment through the income statement).

In
January 2008, we terminated all of our existing derivatives (including those
described above) and received a net cash settlement of approximately $20.7
million in connection therewith.  See Note 20 for additional
information regarding the termination of our derivatives.

In
anticipation of the issuance of Senior Notes in connection with the Madison
River acquisition, we entered into four cash flow hedges that effectively locked
in the interest rate on an aggregate of $400 million of debt.  The
issuance of these Senior Notes was completed in late March 2007 with the
issuance of $500 million of 6.0% Senior Notes, due 2017, and $250 million of
5.5% Senior Notes, due 2013.  We locked in the interest rate on (i)
$200 million of 10-year debt at 5.0675% and (ii) $200 million of 10-year debt at
5.05%.  In March 2007, upon settlement of the hedges, we received an
aggregate of $765,000 cash, which is being amortized as a reduction of interest
expense over the 10-year term of the debt.

During
2007, we also reviewed our exposure to risks related to the assets in our
investment portfolios (including our pension plan assets) in connection with the
market volatility related to the sub-prime credit market issues and other
economic factors.  These unfavorable economic factors did not have a
material adverse impact on the valuation of the assets in our investment
portfolios.

Certain
shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation
of fair value of financial instruments.  Actual values may differ from
those presented if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the fair
value calculations.  The analysis above incorporates only those risk
exposures that existed as of December 31, 2007.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Excluding
cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to provide
for our cash needs.  Our operations have historically provided a
stable source of cash flow which has helped us continue our long-term program of
capital improvements.

Operating
activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0
billion, $840.7 million and $967.1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows
identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating
activities for each of those years.  As relief from the effects of
Hurricane Katrina, certain of our affected subsidiaries were granted a deferral
from making their remaining 2005 estimated federal income and excise tax
payments until 2006.  During 2006, we made payments of approximately
$75 million to satisfy our remaining 2005 estimated payments.  For
additional information relating to our operations, see “Results of Operations”
above.

Investing
activities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $619.2
million, $193.7 million and $483.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  We used $306.8 million of cash (net of approximately
$20.0 million of acquired cash) to purchase Madison River Communications Corp.
(“Madison River”) and pay related closing costs on April 30, 2007 (see below and
Note 2 for additional information).  Cash used for acquisitions was
$75.5 million in 2005 (due to the acquisition of fiber assets in 16 metropolitan
markets from KMC).   We received approximately $122.8 million
cash from the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB during
2006.  See Note 15 for additional information.  Capital
expenditures during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $326.0 million, $314.1 million and
$414.9 million, respectively.

Financing
activities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $402.1
million in 2007, $780.2 million in 2006 and $491.7 million in
2005.  In late March 2007, we publicly issued an aggregate of $750
million of Senior Notes (see Note 5 for additional information).  The
net proceeds from the issuance of such Senior Notes aggregated approximately
$741.8 million and were used (along with cash on hand and approximately $50
million of borrowings under our commercial paper program) to (i) finance the
initial purchase price for the April 30, 2007 acquisition of Madison River ($322
million) and (ii) pay off Madison River’s existing indebtedness (including
accrued interest) at closing ($522 million).  We invested the cash
proceeds from the debt offering in short-term cash equivalents prior to the
acquisition of Madison River. Payments of debt were $713.0 million in 2007,
$82.0 million in 2006 and $693.3 million in 2005.

In
accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased
10.2 million shares (for $460.7 million), 21.4 million shares (for $802.2
million), and 16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million) in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  The 2006 repurchases include 14.36 million shares
repurchased (for an aggregate final adjusted price of approximately $528.4
million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks
(see Note 9 for additional information).  We initially funded
purchases under these agreements principally through borrowings under our $750
million credit facility and cash on hand and subsequently refinanced the credit
facility borrowings through the issuance of short-term commercial
paper.  The 2005 repurchases include 12.9 million shares repurchased
(for an aggregate final price of $437.5 million) under accelerated share
repurchase agreements (see below and Note 9 to the accompanying financial
statements for additional information).

As
described further in Note 5, we called for redemption on August 14, 2007, all of
our $165 million aggregate principal amount of Series K convertible senior
debentures, subject to the right of holders to convert their debentures into
shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $40.455.  In lieu
of cash redemption, holders of approximately $149.6 million aggregate principal
amount of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately
3.7 million shares of CenturyTel common stock.  The remaining $15.4
million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash (including premium and
accrued and unpaid interest).

In
February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of
outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 at an interest rate of
4.628%.  We received no proceeds in connection with the remarketing as
all proceeds were held in trust to secure the obligation of our equity unit
holders to purchase common stock from us on May 16, 2005.  In
connection with the remarketing, we purchased and retired approximately $400
million of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million remaining
outstanding through their maturity in May 2007.  We incurred a pre-tax
charge of approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to
purchasing and retiring the notes.  We purchased such notes with
proceeds from the February 2005 issuance of $350 million of 5% senior notes,
Series M, due 2015 and cash on hand.

On May
16, 2005, upon settlement of 15.9 million of our outstanding equity units, we
received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and issued approximately 12.9
million common shares.  In late May 2005, we entered into accelerated
share repurchase agreements with investment banks whereby we repurchased and
retired 12.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate final price of
$437.5 million, the proceeds of which came from the settlement of the equity
units mentioned above and cash on hand.

Other.

For 2008,
we have budgeted $300 million for capital expenditures.  In 2006, we
concluded that our prior extensive capital investment in our wireline network
permitted us to reduce network capital spending to maintenance
levels.  Our 2008 capital expenditure budget also includes amounts for
expanding our new service offerings and expanding our data
networks.

In the
first quarter of 2008, we paid a $25.0 million deposit to the FCC to enable us
to participate in its auction of 700 MHz spectrum, which is still
ongoing.  Our deposit will be credited against the cost of any
spectrum purchased by us in the auction.

The
following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual
obligations as of December 31, 2007.

(1)  For
additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments, see
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
annual report.

(2)  Represents
the amount of tax and interest we would pay assuming we are required to pay the
entire amount that we have reserved for our unrecognized tax benefits (see Note
12 for

additional information).

The
timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted
with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the “After 2012
and

Other” column in the above table.

We
continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications
operations and expect to continue our long-term strategy of pursuing the
acquisition of attractively-priced communications properties in exchange for
cash, securities or both.  At any given time, we may be engaged in
discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions.  We
generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered
into a preliminary or definitive agreement.  We may require additional
financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which
could have a material impact on our financial condition or
operations.  Approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock and
200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for future issuance in
connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf registration
statement.  We also have access to debt and equity capital
markets.

We have
available a five-year, $750 million revolving credit facility which expires in
December 2011.  The credit facility contains financial covenants that
require us to meet a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility)
not exceeding 4 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the
facility) of at least 1.5 to 1.  The interest rate on revolving loans
under the facility is based on our choice of several prevailing commercial
lending rates plus an additional margin that varies depending on our credit
ratings and aggregate borrowings under the facility.  We must pay a
quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the facility, the amount
of which varies based on our credit ratings.  Up to $150 million of
the credit facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount
available for other extensions of credit.  Available borrowings under
our credit facility are also effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings
under our commercial paper program.  Our commercial paper program
borrowings in turn are effectively limited to the total amount available under
our credit facility.  As of December 31, 2007, we had no amounts
outstanding under our credit facility or commercial paper program.

Moody’s
Investors Service (“Moody’s”) rates our long-term debt Baa2 (with a stable
outlook) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) rates our long-term debt BBB
(with a negative outlook).  Our commercial paper program is rated P2
by Moody’s and A3 by S&P.  Any downgrade in our credit ratings
will increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our $750 million
revolving credit facility.  Downgrades could also restrict our access
to the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement
debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings
by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and
decreasing our financial or operating flexibility.

The following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and
ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.  Our debt to
capitalization ratio has increased primarily due to share repurchases we have
made during the last few years.

REGULATION
AND COMPETITION

The
communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory,
legislative, competitive and technological changes.  These changes may
have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all
communications companies.

Events affecting the communications
industry.

Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute
a significant source of competition with LEC services, especially since wireless
carriers have begun to compete effectively on the basis of price with more
traditional telephone services.  As a result, some customers have
chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and
instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services.  We
anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless service providers
continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates, offer fixed-rate
calling plans, improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new
services.

In 1996,
the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996
Act”), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their
facilities to the LEC’s network and to take various other steps that are
designed to promote competition.  Under the 1996 Act’s rural telephone
company exemption, approximately half of our telephone access lines are exempt
from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the
appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt
from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria.

Prior to
and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state
legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange
competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition
has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative
changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the
continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs’
services.

Federal
USF programs have undergone substantial changes since 1997, and are expected to
experience more changes in the coming years as modernization of the overall
program moves forward.  As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the
FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural
telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five-year period
based on embedded, or historical, costs that provide relatively predictable
levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our
LECs.   In May 2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism
until such time that new high-cost support rules are adopted for rural telephone
companies.  Wireless and other competitive service providers continue
to seek to qualify to receive USF support.  This trend, coupled with
changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stress on the
funding mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on
disbursements.  These developments have placed additional financial
pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide
support to all eligible service providers, including support payments we receive
from the USF High Cost Loop support program.  While our 2007 USF High
Cost Loop support program receipts approximated 2006 levels, we anticipate that
our 2008 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will be lower than
2007 by approximately $14-17 million.

Since May
2007, the FCC and the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service have each
proposed a series of reforms that could, if adopted, substantially restructure
current USF programs.  Until the FCC acts on those recommendations or
issues final rules, we cannot estimate the impact that such proposals would have
on our operations.  In addition, there are a number of judicial
appeals challenging several aspects of the FCC’s universal service rules and
various Congressional proposals seeking to substantially modify USF programs,
none of which have been resolved at this time.  We will continue to be
active in monitoring these developments.

Technological
developments have led to the development of new services that compete with
traditional LEC services.  Technological improvements have enabled
cable television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone
service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have
aggressively pursued this opportunity.  Additionally, several large
electric utilities have announced plans to offer communications services that
compete with LECs.  Improvements in the quality of
"Voice-over-Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several cable,
Internet, data and other communications companies, as well as start-up
companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business
and residential customers.  VoIP providers frequently use existing
broadband networks to deliver flat-rate, all distance calling plans that may
offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional LECs and may be
priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance
telephone services.  In late 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking
proceedings to address the regulation of VoIP, and has adopted orders
establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines.  There can be
no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that
VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers.

In 2003,
the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate
goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications
industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying or
delivering telecommunications traffic.   The FCC has received
intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and industry
negotiations are continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that
addresses the concerns of carriers from all industry
segments.    Until the FCC’s proceeding concludes and the
changes, if any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot estimate the
impact this proceeding will have on our results of operations.

Many
cable, entertainment, technology or other communication companies that
previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering
diversified bundles of services.  As such, a growing number of
companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer
base.  Several of these companies started offering full service
bundles before us, which could give them an advantage in building customer
loyalty.

Recent events affecting
us.

During the last few years, all of the states in which we
provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps to further
introduce competition into the LEC business.  The number of companies
which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in our
service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets acquired
from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be
taken by others in the future.

Certain
long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce their
intrastate access tariffed rates.  In addition, we have recently
experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement
of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling
services.   In 2007 we incurred a reduction in our intrastate
revenues of approximately $20.9 million compared to 2006 primarily due to these
factors.  The corresponding decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was
$19.2 million.  We believe this trend of decreased intrastate minutes
will continue in 2008, although the magnitude of such decrease is
uncertain.

We expect
our operating revenues in 2008 to decline as we continue to experience downward
pressure primarily due to continued access line losses, reduced network access
revenues and lower prior year revenue settlement amounts.   We
expect such declines to be partially offset primarily due to increased demand
for our high-speed Internet service offering and the impact of recognizing a
full year of revenues associated with our Madison River properties acquired in
April 2007.

For a
more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations
and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual
report.

Other matters.

Our
regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon
in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
(“SFAS 71”).  Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance
of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and
impose a liability on a regulated enterprise.  Such regulatory assets
and liabilities are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the
balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71.  We are monitoring the
ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to our regulated telephone operations due to
the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is
possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand
for regulated services or products could result in our telephone operations no
longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future.

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, “Regulated Enterprises – Accounting
for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71” (“SFAS 101”),
specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria
for application of SFAS 71.  SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the
effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and
liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as
assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises.  Depreciation
rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone
operations subject to SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal
costs in excess of the related estimated salvage
value.  Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us
to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of
salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the
assets.  Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for
our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71.   SFAS 101 further
provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be
adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be
judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises.

Our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 included regulatory
liabilities of approximately $198.4 million related to estimated removal costs
embedded in accumulated depreciation (as described above).  Net
deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory assets and liabilities
quantified above were $77.0 million.

When and
if our regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, we
currently do not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying
value of the property, plant and equipment of our regulated telephone
operations.  Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we
would be required to revise the lives of our property, plant and equipment to
reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets.  We currently do not
expect such revisions in asset lives will have a material impact on our results
of operations.  Upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we also would be
required to eliminate certain intercompany transactions with regulated
affiliates that currently are not eliminated under the application of SFAS
71.  For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $146 million
of revenues (and related costs) would have been eliminated had we not been
subject to the provisions of SFAS 71.   Such elimination would
have had no impact on total operating income.  For regulatory
purposes, the accounting and reporting of our telephone subsidiaries will not be
affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71.

We have
certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the
protection of the environment.  Costs of compliance through 2007 have
not been material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become
material.

Management
has prepared and is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of our
consolidated financial statements.  The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and necessarily include amounts
determined using our best judgments and estimates.

Our
consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, who have expressed their opinion with respect
to the fairness of the consolidated financial statements.  Their audit
was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation under the framework of
COSO

,

management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2007.  The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by KPMG LLP, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

On April
30, 2007, CenturyTel, Inc. (“CenturyTel”) acquired Madison River Communications
Corp. (“Madison River”) and management excluded from its assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2007, Madison River’s internal control over financial reporting associated
with total assets of $967.9 million and total revenues of $130.5 million
included in the consolidated financial statements of CenturyTel as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2007.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of independent directors who are
not officers or employees.  The Committee meets periodically with the
external auditors, internal auditors and management.  The Committee
considers the independence of the external auditors and the audit scope and
discusses internal control, financial and reporting matters.  Both the
external and internal auditors have free access to the Committee.

The Board
of Directors and Stockholders

CenturyTel,
Inc.:

We have
audited the consolidated financial statements of CenturyTel, Inc. and
subsidiaries as listed in Item 15a(1). In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule as listed in Item 15a(2). These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of CenturyTel, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As
discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January
1, 2007 the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax
positions.  In addition, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed its method of accounting for
share-based payments (effective January 1, 2006) and pension and postretirement
benefits (as of December 31, 2006).

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in

Internal

December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying

Report of
Management

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, CenturyTel, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

On April
30, 2007, CenturyTel, Inc. (“CenturyTel”) acquired Madison River Communications
Corp. (“Madison River”) and management excluded from its assessment of the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2007, Madison River’s internal control over financial reporting associated
with total assets of $967.9 million and total revenues of $130.5 million
included in the consolidated financial statements of CenturyTel as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2007. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control
over financial reporting of Madison River.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of
CenturyTel, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in Item 15(a)(1), and our report

SUMMARY
      OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation

-
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyTel, Inc.
and its majority-owned subsidiaries.

Regulatory accounting

- Our
regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon
in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
(“SFAS 71”).  Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance
of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and
impose a liability on a regulated enterprise.  Such regulatory assets
and liabilities are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the
balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71.  We are monitoring the
ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to our regulated telephone operations due to
the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is
possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand
for regulated services or products could result in our telephone operations no
longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future.  Our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 included regulatory liabilities of
approximately $198.4 million related to estimated removal costs embedded in
accumulated depreciation (as required to be recorded by
regulators).  Net deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory
assets and liabilities quantified above were $77.0 million.

Estimates

- The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Revenue recognition

-
Revenues are generally recognized when services are provided or when products
are delivered to customers. Revenue that is billed in advance includes monthly
recurring network access services, special access services and monthly recurring
local line charges.  The unearned portion of this revenue is initially
deferred as a component of advanced billings and customer deposits on our
balance sheet and recognized as revenue over the period that the services are
provided.  Revenue that is billed in arrears includes switched access
services, nonrecurring network access services, nonrecurring local services and
long distance services.  The earned but unbilled portion of this
revenue is recognized as revenue in the period that the services are
provided.  Revenues from installation activities (along with the
related costs) are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the
customer relationship.

Certain
of our telephone subsidiaries’ revenues are based on tariffed access charges
filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission; the remainder of our
telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other
telephone companies for interstate revenue (except for broadband related
revenues) and for certain intrastate revenue.  Such sharing
arrangements are funded by toll revenue and/or access charges within state
jurisdictions and by access charges in the interstate market. Revenues earned
through certain sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on our
estimates.

Allowance for doubtful
accounts

.  In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts
receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customer’s or
carrier’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time
the receivable has been past due and historical collection
experience.  Based on these assessments, we record both specific and
general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the stated
amount of applicable accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to
collect.

Property, plant and equipment

- - Telephone plant is stated at original cost.  Normal retirements of
telephone plant are charged against accumulated depreciation, along with the
costs of removal, less salvage, with no gain or loss
recognized.  Renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are
capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are charged to
operating expense.  Depreciation of telephone plant is provided on the
straight line method using class or overall group rates acceptable to regulatory
authorities; such average rates range from 2% to 20%.

Non-telephone
property is stated at cost and, when sold or retired, a gain or loss is
recognized.  Depreciation of such property is provided on the straight
line method over estimated service lives ranging from two to 35
years.

Intangible assets

– Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS 142”), requires goodwill recorded in a business combination to be
reviewed for impairment and to be written down only in periods in which the
recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. We test impairment of
goodwill at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to
its carrying value (including goodwill). We base our estimates of the fair value
of the reporting unit on valuation models using criterion such as multiples of
earnings.

Long-lived assets

- -  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”), addresses
financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets (exclusive of goodwill) and also broadens the reporting of discontinued
operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be
distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction.  During
2007, we recognized a $16.6 million pre-tax impairment charge in order to
write-down the value of certain of our long-lived assets in certain of our CLEC
markets to their estimated realizable value.

Affiliated transactions

-
Certain of our service subsidiaries provide installation and maintenance
services, materials and supplies, and managerial, operational, technical,
accounting and administrative services to other subsidiaries.  In
addition, CenturyTel provides and bills management services to subsidiaries and
in certain instances makes interest bearing advances to finance construction of
plant and purchases of equipment.  These transactions are recorded by
our telephone subsidiaries at their cost to the extent permitted by regulatory
authorities.  Intercompany profit on transactions with regulated
affiliates is limited to a reasonable return on investment and has not been
eliminated in connection with consolidating the results of operations of
CenturyTel and its subsidiaries.  Intercompany profit on transactions
with affiliates not subject to SFAS 71 has been eliminated.

Income taxes

- We file a
consolidated federal income tax return with our eligible
subsidiaries.  We use the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases.

Postretirement and pension
plans

– We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other
Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”) as of December 31, 2006.  SFAS 158
requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined
benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or a liability on our balance
sheet, with an adjustment to stockholders’ equity (reflected as an increase or
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss).  The
incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on individual line items of our balance
sheet as of December 31, 2006 were as follows:

Cumulative effect adjustment

– In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements
when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Results” (“SAB
108”).  SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected
misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
year financial statements.  SAB 108 requires companies to quantify
misstatements using both a balance sheet approach and income statement approach
and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is
material in light of the relevant quantitative and qualitative
factors.

As of
December 31, 2006, we identified two misstatements that previously were deemed
immaterial using the income statement approach that are now deemed material upon
application of the balance sheet approach.  Such misstatements relate
to (i) the failure to capitalize interest in connection with the development of
our billing system, which began in the late 1990’s; and (ii) the failure to
defer the revenues and costs associated with installation activities related to
our service offerings.  Using the guidance of SAB 108, we have
recorded a net cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings (as of January
1, 2006), which increased retained earnings approximately $9.7 million
(presented on an after-tax basis).  Of the $9.7 million net increase
to retained earnings, approximately $14.0 million related to the capitalized
interest adjustment, which was partially offset by a reduction to retained
earnings of approximately $4.3 million related to the installation activities
adjustment.  We adjusted our results of operations for the first,
second and third quarters of 2006 to reflect the ongoing application of the
above.  Such adjustments were immaterial to each quarter.

Stock-based compensation

–
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”, which
requires us to measure our cost of awarding employees with equity instruments
based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date.  Prior to
January 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25.  See Note 14 for additional information.

Derivative financial
instruments

– We account for derivative instruments and hedging
activities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS
133”), as amended.  SFAS 133, as amended, requires that all derivative
instruments, such as interest rate swaps, be recognized in the financial
statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of
holding them.  On the date a derivative contract is entered into, we
designate the derivative as either a fair value or cash flow hedge.  A
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized
firm commitment is a fair value hedge. A hedge of a forecasted transaction or
the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
asset or liability is a cash flow hedge.  We also formally assess,
both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If we determine that a derivative
is not, or is no longer, highly effective as a hedge, we would discontinue hedge
accounting prospectively.  We recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at their fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments are either recognized in income or stockholders’ equity
(as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), depending on
whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in the fair value or cash
flows.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.  Management periodically reviews our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the
exposure.  See Note 6 for additional information.

Earnings per share

- Basic
earnings per share amounts are determined on the basis of the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the applicable accounting
period.  Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potential
dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.  See
Note 13 for additional information.

Cash equivalents

- We
consider short-term investments with a maturity at date of purchase of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

ACQUISITIONS

On April
30, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Madison River
Communications Corp. (“Madison River”) from Madison River Telephone Company, LLC
for an initial aggregate purchase price of approximately $322 million
cash.  In connection with the acquisition, we also paid all of Madison
River’s existing indebtedness (including accrued interest), which approximated
$522 million.  At the time of this acquisition, Madison River operated
approximately 164,000 predominantly rural access lines in four states with more
than 30% high-speed Internet penetration and its network included ownership in a
2,400 route mile fiber network.  We believe this acquisition adds
attractive markets with good demographics and growth prospects and its fiber
network is complementary to our existing operations.

We are
accounting for the acquisition of Madison River as a purchase under the guidance
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations”
(“SFAS 141”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, “Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (“SFAS 71”).  SFAS 141
requires us to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their
respective fair values.  In accordance with SFAS 71, we recorded the
fixed assets of Madison River’s regulated telephone operations at historical
book value since those values are used to develop the rates we charge to our
customers (which are approved by regulatory authorities).

We have
reflected the results of operations of the Madison River properties in our
consolidated results of operations beginning May 1, 2007.

The total
cost of the Madison River acquisition through December 31, 2007 is composed of
the following components (amounts in thousands):

Holdings, Inc. (“KMC”) for approximately $75.5 million.  The assets
acquired and liabilities assumed have been reflected in our consolidated balance
sheet based on a purchase price allocation determined by independent third
parties.   The vast majority of the purchase price was allocated
to property, plant and equipment.  The results of operations of the
KMC properties are included in our results of operations beginning July 1,
2005.

Our
goodwill was derived from numerous previous acquisitions whereby the purchase
price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.  Goodwill
increased in 2007 as a result of our Madison River acquisition.  We
test for goodwill impairment annually under SFAS 142 and, based on our analysis
performed as of September 30, 2007, determined our goodwill was not
impaired.

We
accounted for the costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care
system in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use.”  Aggregate capitalized costs (before accumulated amortization)
totaled $231.2 million and are being amortized over a twenty-year
period.

In the
third quarter of 2004, we entered into a three-year agreement with EchoStar
Communications Corporation (“EchoStar”) to provide co-branded DISH Network
satellite television services to our customers.  As part of the
transaction, we invested $25 million in an EchoStar convertible subordinated
debt security, which had a fair value at date of issuance of approximately $20.8
million and matures in 2011.

In
connection with the acquisitions of properties from Verizon Communications, Inc.
(“Verizon”) in 2002 and Madison River in 2007, we assigned an aggregate of $41.7
million of the respective purchase prices as an intangible asset associated with
franchise costs (which includes amounts necessary to maintain eligibility to
provide telecommunications services in its licensed service
areas).   Such assets have an indefinite life and therefore are
not subject to amortization currently.

In connection with various acquisitions we have made over the past several
years, we have allocated amounts to a customer list intangible asset, including
$156.8 million from our Madison River acquisition in 2007 and $22.7 million from
our acquisition of Verizon properties in 2002.  Such assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods that range from 5-15
years.  Total amortization expense for these customer base and other
intangible assets for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $12.2 million, $3.1 million and
$3.0 million, respectively, and is expected to be $16.1 million annually from
2008 through 2011 and $15.7 million in 2012.

Certain
of our loan agreements contain various restrictions, among which are limitations
regarding issuance of additional debt, payment of cash dividends, reacquisition
of capital stock and other matters.  In addition, the transfer of
funds from certain consolidated subsidiaries to CenturyTel is restricted by
various loan agreements.  Subsidiaries which have loans from
government agencies and cooperative lending associations, or have issued first
mortgage bonds, generally may not loan or advance any funds to CenturyTel, but
may pay dividends if certain financial ratios are met.  At December
31, 2007, restricted net assets of subsidiaries were $131.8 million and
subsidiaries’ retained earnings in excess of amounts restricted by debt
covenants totaled $1.3 billion.  At December 31, 2007, approximately
$2.3 billion of our consolidated retained earnings reflected on the balance
sheet was available under our loan agreements for the declaration of
dividends.

The
senior notes and debentures of CenturyTel referred to above were issued under an
indenture dated March 31, 1994.  This indenture does not contain any
financial covenants, but does include restrictions that limit our ability to (i)
incur, issue or create liens upon its property and (ii) consolidate with or
merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to, any
other party.  The indenture does not contain any provisions that are
impacted by our credit ratings, or that restrict the issuance of new securities
in the event of a material adverse change to us.

Approximately
14% of our property, plant and equipment is pledged to secure the long-term debt
of subsidiaries.

On March
29, 2007, we publicly issued $500 million of 6.0% Senior Notes, Series N, due
2017 and $250 million of 5.5% Senior Notes, Series O, due 2013.  Our
$741.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of these Senior Notes were used to
pay a substantial portion of the approximately $844 million of cash that was
needed in order to (i) pay the initial purchase price for the acquisition of
Madison River on April 30, 2007 ($322 million) and (ii) pay off Madison River’s
existing indebtedness (including accrued interest) at closing ($522
million).  We funded the remainder of these cash outflows from
borrowings under our commercial paper program and cash on hand.  See
Note 2 for additional information concerning the acquisition of Madison
River.

In July
2007, we called for redemption on August 14, 2007 all of our $165 million
aggregate principal amount 4.75% convertible senior debentures, Series K, due
2032 at a redemption price of $1,023.80 per $1,000 principal amount of
debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest through August 13,
2007.  In accordance with the indenture, holders could elect to
convert their debentures into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion
price of $40.455 per share prior to August 10, 2007.  In lieu of cash
redemption, holders of approximately $149.6 million aggregate principal amount
of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately 3.7
million shares of CenturyTel common stock.  The remaining $15.4
million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash (including premium and
accrued and unpaid interest).  As a result, we no longer have any of
the Series K debentures outstanding.  We recognized a pre-tax charge
of approximately $366,000 in third quarter 2007 related to the cash redemption
portion of these transactions.

In May
2002, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of
equity units, each of which were priced at $25 and consisted initially of a
beneficial interest in a CenturyTel senior unsecured note (Series J, due 2007
and remarketable in 2005) with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to
purchase shares of CenturyTel common stock no later than May 2005. Each purchase
contract generally required the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a
share of CenturyTel common stock on May 16, 2005 in exchange for $25, subject to
certain adjustments and exceptions.

In
February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of
outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 (the notes described above), at an
interest rate of 4.628%.  We received no proceeds in connection with
the remarketing as all net proceeds were held in trust to secure the equity unit
holders’ obligation to purchase common stock from us on May 16,
2005.  In connection with the remarketing, we purchased and retired
approximately $400 million of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million
of remaining outstanding notes (which were subsequently repaid in
2007).  We incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $6.0 million in
the first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing and retiring the
notes.  Proceeds to purchase such notes came from the February 2005
issuance of $350 million of 5% senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and cash on
hand.

Between
April 15, 2005 and May 4, 2005, we repurchased and cancelled an aggregate of
approximately 4.1 million of our equity units in privately-negotiated
transactions with six institutional holders at an average price of $25.18 per
unit.  The remaining 15.9 million equity units outstanding on May 16,
2005 were settled in stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
purchase contract that formed a part of such unit.  Accordingly, on
May 16, 2005, we received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and issued
approximately 12.9 million common shares in the aggregate.  See Note 9
for information on our accelerated share repurchase program which mitigated the
dilutive impact of issuing these 12.9 million shares.

As of
December 31, 2007, we had available a $750 million five-year revolving credit
facility which expires in December 2011.  We also have a commercial
paper program under which borrowings are effectively limited to the total amount
available under our credit facility.  As of December 31, 2007, we had
no amounts outstanding under either our credit facility or commercial paper
program.

DERIVATIVE
      INSTRUMENTS

In 2003,
we entered into four separate fair value interest rate hedges associated with
the full $500 million principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due 2012,
that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%.  These hedges are “fixed
to variable” interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixed rate
interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable
rates that range from the six-month London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus
3.229% to the six-month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset dates
occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August
2012.  During 2007, we realized an average interest rate under these
hedges of 8.70% and interest expense was greater than it would have otherwise
been by $4.1 million during 2007 as a result of these
hedges.   The aggregate fair value of such hedges at December 31,
2007 was $3.0 million and is reflected on the accompanying balance sheet as both
an asset (included in “Other Assets”) and as an increase to our underlying
long-term debt.

In third
quarter 2007, we entered into a hedge transaction that effectively locked-in the
interest rate for the six-month period ended February 2008 related to the $500
million of Series L notes that previously were effectively converted to variable
rate notes pursuant to the “fixed to variable” interest rate swaps described
above.  This hedge did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and
therefore is adjusted to its fair value each period (with a corresponding
adjustment through the income statement).  The impact of this
transaction to 2007 results of operations was not material.

In
January 2008, we terminated all of our existing derivatives (including those
described above) and received a net cash settlement of approximately $20.7
million in connection therewith.  See Note 20 for additional
information regarding the termination of our derivatives.

In anticipation of the issuance of Senior Notes in connection with the Madison
River acquisition, we entered into four cash flow hedges that effectively locked
in the interest rate on an aggregate of $400 million of debt.  The
issuance of these Senior Notes was completed in late March 2007 with the
issuance of $500 million of 6.0% Senior Notes, due 2017, and $250 million of
5.5% Senior Notes, due 2013.  We locked in the interest rate on (i)
$200 million of 10-year debt at 5.0675% and (ii) $200 million of 10-year debt at
5.05%.  In March 2007, upon settlement of the hedges, we received an
aggregate of $765,000 cash, which is being amortized as a reduction of interest
expense over the 10-year term of the debt.

REDUCTIONS
      IN WORKFORCE

On March
1, 2006 and August 30, 2006, we announced workforce reductions involving an
aggregate of approximately 400 jobs, or 6% of our workforce, primarily due to
increased competitive pressures and the loss of access lines over the last
several years.  For 2006, we incurred a net pre-tax charge of
approximately $7.5 million (consisting of a $9.4 million charge to operating
expenses, net of a $1.9 million favorable revenue impact related to such
expenses as allowed through our rate-making process) in connection with
severance and related costs.  Of the $9.4 million charged to operating
expenses, approximately $8.6 million was reflected in cost of services and
products and $845,000 was reflected in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

In
September 2007, we announced a reduction of our workforce to be completed by
mid-2008 of approximately 200 jobs, primarily due to the progress made on our
Madison River integration plan and the elimination of certain customer service
personnel due to reduced call volumes.  We incurred a one-time net
pre-tax charge of approximately $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2007
(consisting of a $2.7 million charge to operating expenses, net of a $527,000
favorable revenue impact related to such expenses as allowed through our
rate-making process) in connection with the severance and related
costs.  Of the $2.7 million charged to operating expenses,
approximately $2.0 million is reflected in cost of services and products and
$774,000 is reflected in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

The
following table reflects additional information regarding the severance-related
liability for 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

In
accordance with stock repurchase programs described below, we repurchased 10.2
million shares (for $460.7 million), 21.4 million shares (for $802.2 million)
and 16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million) in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  The 2006 and 2005 repurchases included 14.36 million
and 12.9 million shares, respectively, repurchased (for a total price of $528.4
and $437.5 million, respectively) under accelerated share repurchase agreements
(see below for additional information).

In August
2007, our board of directors authorized a $750 million share repurchase program
which expires on September 30, 2009, unless extended by the
board.    Through December 31, 2007, we had repurchased
approximately 3.6 million shares for $158.5 million under this
program.

On
February 21, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program
authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock and
terminated the approximately $13 million remaining balance of our existing $200
million share repurchase program approved in February 2005.  In
February 2006, we repurchased the first $500 million of common stock through
accelerated share repurchase agreements entered into with various investment
banks, repurchasing and retiring approximately 14.36 million shares of common
stock at an average initial price of $34.83 per share.  We funded
repurchases under these agreements through short-term borrowings and cash on
hand.  As part of the accelerated share repurchase transactions, we
simultaneously entered into forward contracts with the investment banks whereby
the investment banks purchased an aggregate of 14.36 million shares of our
common stock during the terms of the contracts.   At the end of
the repurchase period in mid-July 2006, we paid an aggregate of approximately
$28.4 million cash to the investment banks to compensate them for the difference
between their weighted average purchase price during the repurchase period and
the initial average price.  We reflected such settlement amount as an
adjustment to retained earnings in our financial statements during
2006.  We repurchased the remaining $500 million of common stock of
this program through open market transactions through June 2007.

In late
May 2005, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with three
investment banks whereby we repurchased and retired approximately 12.9 million
shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $416.5 million cash (or an
initial average price of $32.34 per share).  We funded this purchase
using the proceeds received from the settlement of the equity units mentioned in
Note 5 and from cash on hand.  As part of the accelerated share
repurchase transactions, we simultaneously entered into forward contracts with
the investment banks whereby the investment banks purchased an aggregate of 12.9
million shares of our common stock during the term of the
contracts.  At the end of the repurchase period, we paid an aggregate
of approximately $21.0 million cash to the investment banks to compensate them
for the difference between their weighted average purchase price during the
repurchase period and the initial average price.  We reflected such
settlement amount as an adjustment to paid-in capital.

During
2006, our stockholders’ equity was reduced by approximately $97.9 million upon
the adoption of SFAS 158 and increased approximately $9.7 million upon the
application of SAB 108.  See Note 1 for additional
information.

Under
CenturyTel’s Articles of Incorporation each share of common stock beneficially
owned continuously by the same person since May 30, 1987 generally entitles the
holder thereof to ten votes per share. All other shares entitle the holder to
one vote per share.  At December 31, 2007, the holders of 3.6 million
shares of common stock (or 26% of our total voting power) were entitled to ten
votes per share.

Preferred stock

- As of
December 31, 2007, we had 2.0 million shares of authorized preferred stock, $25
par value per share.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were
279,000 and 298,000 shares, respectively, of outstanding convertible preferred
stock.  Holders of outstanding CenturyTel preferred stock are entitled
to receive cumulative dividends, receive preferential distributions equal to $25
per share plus unpaid dividends upon CenturyTel’s liquidation and vote as a
single class with the holders of common stock.

Shareholders’ Rights Plan

- -  On November 1, 2006, our 1996 rights agreement (and each preference
share purchase right issued thereunder) lapsed in accordance with its stated
terms.

POSTRETIREMENT
      BENEFITS

We
sponsor health care plans (which use a December 31 measurement date) that
provide postretirement benefits to all qualified retired
employees.  Over the past few years, in connection with negotiating
certain union contracts, we amended certain retiree contribution and retirement
eligibility provisions of our plan.

In

of December 31, 2007) and unrecognized net actuarial loss ($15.1 million as of
December 31, 2007) components have been reflected as a $2.8 million after-tax
increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’
equity.  The estimated amount of amortization expense (income) of the
above unrecognized items that will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss and reflected as a component of net periodic pension cost
during 2008 is ($2.6 million) for the prior service credit.

We employ
a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income
investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a
prudent level of risk.  The intent of this strategy is to minimize
plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long
term.  Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial
condition.  We measure and monitor investment risk on an ongoing basis
through annual liability measurements, periodic asset studies and periodic
portfolio reviews.

Our postretirement benefit plan weighted-average asset allocations at December
31, 2007 and 2006 by asset category are as follows:

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, we study historical markets and
apply the widely-accepted capital market principle that assets with higher
volatility and risk generate a greater return over the long term.  We
evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before
determining long-term capital market assumptions.  We also review peer
data and historical returns to check for reasonableness.

Assumed health care cost trends have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for postretirement benefit plans.  A one-percentage-point
change in assumed health care cost rates would have the following
effects:

We expect
to contribute approximately $16.7 million to our postretirement benefit plan in
2008.

Our
estimated future projected benefit payments under our postretirement benefit
plan are as follows:

DEFINED
      BENEFIT AND OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS

We
sponsor defined benefit pension plans for substantially all
employees.  At December 31, 2007, we also sponsored a Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan to provide certain officers with supplemental
retirement, death and disability benefits.   We use a December 31
measurement date for all our plans.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the
aggregate benefit obligation and the plan assets for our above-referenced
defined benefit plans.

evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before
determining long-term capital market assumptions.  We also review peer

The
amount of the 2008 contribution will be determined based on a number of factors,
including the results of the 2008 actuarial valuation report.  At this
time, the amount of the 2008 contribution is not known.

Our
estimated future projected benefit payments under our defined benefit pension
plans are as follows: 2008 - $32.5 million; 2009 - $33.4 million; 2010 - $34.9

Through
December 31, 2006, we also sponsored an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”)
which covers most employees with one year of service and is funded by our
contributions determined annually by the Board of Directors.  Our
expense related to the ESOP during 2006 and 2005 was $7.9 million and $7.3
million, respectively.   Our contribution to the ESOP was
discontinued after 2006.

We
also sponsor qualified profit sharing plans pursuant to Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plans”) which are available to substantially
all employees.  Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plans were
$10.6 million in 2007, $8.6 million in 2006 and $8.5 million in
2005.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions

Of the
$799.0 million net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2007, approximately
$810.6 million is reflected as a net long-term liability (in “Other deferred
credits”) and approximately $11.6 million is reflected as a net current deferred
tax asset (in “Other current assets”).

We
establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets
to amounts we expect to realize.  As of December 31, 2007, we had
available tax benefits associated with net state operating loss carryforwards,
which expire through 2027, of $31.6 million.  The ultimate realization
of the benefits of the carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible.  We consider our scheduled reversal of deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in
making this assessment.  As a result of such assessment, we reserved
$30.9 million through the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2007 as it is
more likely than not that this amount of net operating loss carryforwards will
not be utilized prior to expiration.

In June
2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial
statements.  FIN 48 required us, effective January 1, 2007, to
recognize and measure tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
and disclose uncertainties in income tax positions.

Upon the
initial adoption of FIN 48, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to
retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 (which increased retained earnings by
approximately $478,000 as of such date) related to certain previously
unrecognized tax benefits that did not meet the criteria for liability
recognition upon the adoption of FIN 48.

During
2007, primarily as a result of certain issues being effectively settled through
examination and the lapse of statute of limitations, our tax expense was reduced
approximately $32.7 million (including related interest and net of federal
benefit) upon the release of amounts that were previously reflected as a
liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

The following table reflects the activity of our gross unrecognized tax benefits
(excluding both interest and any related federal benefit) during 2007 (amounts
expressed in thousands).

Of the
above ending balance of $33.8 million, approximately $21.5 million is included
as a component of “Deferred credits and other liabilities” and the remainder is
included in “Accrued income taxes”.   If we were to prevail on
all unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet, approximately $26.1
million (including interest and net of federal benefit) would benefit the
effective tax rate.

Our
policy is to reflect accrued interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax.  We had accrued interest (presented before related tax
benefits) of approximately $20.7 million as of January 1, 2007 and $12.9 million
as of December 31, 2007.

We file
income tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state
and local jurisdictions.  Our uncertain income tax positions are
related to tax years that are currently under or remain subject to examination
by the relevant taxing authorities.  Our open income tax years by
major jurisdiction are as follows.

Additionally,
it is possible that certain jurisdictions in which we do not believe we have an
income tax filing responsibility, and accordingly did not file a return, may
attempt to assess a liability.  Since the period for assessing
additional liability typically begins upon the filing of a return, it is
possible that certain jurisdictions could assess tax for years prior to the open
tax years disclosed above.

Based on
(i) the potential outcomes of these ongoing examinations, (ii) the expiration of
statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, (iii) the negotiated
settlement of certain disputed issues, or (iv) a jurisdiction’s administrative
practices, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits
for tax positions previously taken may decrease by up to $14 million within the
next 12 months. The actual amount of such decrease, if any, will depend on
several future developments and events, many of which are outside our
control.

In July
2007, we called for redemption on August 14, 2007 all of our $165 million
aggregate principal amount 4.75% convertible senior debentures, Series K, due
2032.  In accordance with the indenture, holders could elect to
convert their debentures into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion
price of $40.455 per share prior to August 10, 2007.  In lieu of cash
redemption, holders of approximately $149.6 million aggregate principal amount
of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately 3.7
million shares of CenturyTel common stock.

In
connection with calculating our diluted earnings per share for our accelerated
share repurchase program discussed in Note 9, we assumed the accelerated share
repurchase market price adjustment would be settled through our issuance of
additional shares of common stock, which was allowed (at our discretion) in the
agreement.  Accordingly, the estimated shares issuable based on the
fair value of the forward contract was included in the weighted average shares
outstanding for the computation of diluted earnings per share.

The
weighted average number of shares of common stock subject to issuance under
outstanding options that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings
per share because the exercise price of the option was greater than the average
market price of the common stock was 792,000 for 2007, 1.0 million for 2006 and
1.8 million for 2005.

(14)           STOCK
COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

Effective
January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
123(R)”).   SFAS 123(R) requires us to measure our cost of
awarding employees with equity instruments based upon the fair value of the
award on the grant date.  Such cost will be recognized as compensation
expense over the period during which the employee is required to provide service
in exchange for the award.  Compensation cost is also recognized over
the applicable remaining vesting period for any outstanding options that were
not fully vested as of January 1, 2006.  We did not have any unvested
outstanding options as of January 1, 2006 since our Board of Directors
accelerated the vesting of all unvested options effective as of December 31,
2005, as described below.  We elected the modified prospective
transition method as permitted by SFAS 123(R); accordingly, we did not restate
prior period results.

We
currently maintain programs which allow the Board of Directors, through its
Compensation Committee, to grant incentives to certain employees and our outside
directors in any one or a combination of several forms, including incentive and
non-qualified stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock; and
performance shares.  As of December 31, 2007, we had reserved
approximately 6.2 million shares of common stock which may be issued in
connection with awards under our current incentive programs.  We also
offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan whereby employees can purchase our common
stock at a 15% discount based on the lower of the beginning or ending stock
price during recurring six-month periods stipulated in such
program.

As of
December 31, 2005, we had approximately 6.0 million options outstanding from
prior grants, all of which were issued with exercise prices either equal to or
exceeding the then-current market price.  All of these options were
exercisable as a result of actions taken by our Board of Directors in December
2005 to accelerate the vesting of all unvested options outstanding, effective as
of December 31, 2005, in order to eliminate the recognition of compensation
expense which otherwise would have been required upon the effectiveness of SFAS
123(R).

During
2007 we granted 983,920 stock options with exercise prices at market
value.  All of these options expire ten years after the date of grant
and have a three-year vesting period.  The weighted average fair value
of each option was estimated as of the date of grant to be $14.57 using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following
assumptions:  dividend yield – .6%; expected volatility - 28%
(executive officers) and 25% (all other employees); weighted average risk free
interest rate – 4.6% (rates ranged from 3.5% to 5.1%); and expected term – 6.5
years (executive officers) and 4.5 years (all other employees).

During
2006 we granted 1,007,175 stock options with exercise prices at market
value.  The weighted average fair value of each of the 2006 options
was estimated as of the date of grant to be $12.75 using an option-pricing model
with the following assumptions: dividend yield - .7%; expected volatility - 30%;
weighted average risk-free interest rate – 4.65% (rates ranged from 4.28% to
5.22%); and expected option life - 7 years (executive officers) and 5 years (all
other employees).

During
2005 we granted 1,015,025 stock options with exercise prices at market
value.  The weighted average fair value of each of the 2005 options
was estimated as of the date of grant to be $12.68 using an option-pricing model
with the following assumptions: dividend yield - .7%; expected volatility - 30%;
weighted average risk-free interest rate – 4.2%; and expected option life -
seven years.

The
expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our common stock
over the 6.5- and 4.5- year terms mentioned above.  The expected term
was determined based on the historical exercise and forfeiture rates for similar
grants.

Stock option transactions during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as
follows:

In
addition, during 2007, we issued 288,896 shares of restricted stock to certain
employees and our outside directors at a weighted-average price of $45.89 per
share.  During 2006, we issued 293,943 shares of restricted stock to
certain employees and our outside directors at a weighted-average price of
$36.02 per share.  During 2005, we issued 286,123 shares of restricted
stock at a weighted-average price of $33.47 per share.  Such
restricted stock vests over a five-year period (for employees) and a three-year
period (for outside directors).   Nonvested restricted stock
transactions during 2007 were as follows:

The total
compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements in 2007, 2006 and 2005
was $20.0 million, $11.9 million and $4.7 million, respectively.  We
recognized a tax benefit related to such arrangements of approximately $7.5
million in 2007, $4.5 million in 2006 and $1.8 million in 2005.  As of
December 31, 2007, there was $29.9 million of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to the share-based payment arrangements, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.

We
received net cash proceeds of $38.7 million during 2007 in connection with
option exercises.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised (the
amount by which the market price of the stock on the date of exercise exceeded
the market price of the stock on the date of grant) was $17.2 million during
2007,  $31.0 million during 2006 and  $16.3 million during
2005.  The excess tax benefit realized from stock options exercised
and restricted stock released during 2007 was $6.4 million. The total fair value
of restricted stock that vested during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $6.4 million,
$2.6 million, and $208,000, respectively.

Prior
to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” as allowed by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).   Options have been granted at a
price either equal to or exceeding the then-current market
price.   Accordingly, we did not recognize compensation cost in
connection with issuing stock options prior to January 1, 2006.  If
compensation cost for our options had been determined consistent with SFAS
123(R), we would have recognized stock-based compensation expense for 2005 of
approximately $12.5 million after-tax and our net income, basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share for 2005 would have been $322.0 million,
$2.46 and $2.40, respectively, all presented on a pro forma basis, as compared
to actual net income, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share of
$334.5 million, $2.55 and $2.49, respectively.

GAIN
      ON ASSET DISPOSITIONS

In the
third quarter of 2007, we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $10.4 million
related to the sale of our interest in a real estate partnership.  In
April 2006, upon dissolution of the Rural Telephone Bank (“RTB”), we received
$122.8 million in cash for redemption of our investment in stock of the RTB and
recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $117.8 million in the second quarter of
2006 related to this transaction.  Upon final distribution of all
funds related to the RTB dissolution in November 2007, we received an additional
$5.2 million cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of such amount.  Such
gains are included in “Other income (expense)” on our Consolidated Statements of
Income.

(16)

SUPPLEMENTAL
      CASH FLOW AND OTHER DISCLOSURES

The
amount of interest actually paid, net of amounts capitalized of $1.3 million,
$1.9 million, and $2.8 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, was
$205.2 million, $191.9 million, and $194.8 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  Income taxes paid were $185.3 million in 2007, $212.4
million in 2006, and $88.8 million in 2005. Income tax refunds totaled $1.1
million in 2007, $3.0 million in 2006, and $4.9 million in 2005.

We have
consummated the acquisitions of various operations, along with certain other
assets, during the three years ended December 31, 2007.  In connection

See Note 2 for additional information related to our acquisition of Madison

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued EITF 06-3, “How
Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should
be Presented in the Income Statement” (“EITF 06-3”), which requires disclosure
of the accounting policy for any tax assessed by a governmental authority that
is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction.  We adopted
the disclosure requirements of EITF 06-3 effective January 1, 2007.

We collect various taxes from our
customers and subsequently remit such funds to governmental
authorities.  Substantially all of these taxes are recorded through
the balance sheet.  We are required to contribute to several universal
service fund programs and generally include a surcharge amount on our customers’
bills which is designed to recover our contribution costs.  Such
amounts are reflected on a gross basis in our statement of income (included in
both operating revenues and expenses) and aggregated approximately $41 million
for 2007, $40 million for 2006 and $37 million for 2005.

FAIR
      VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The
following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of
certain of our financial instruments at December 31, 2007 and
2006.

(1)

Fair
      value was estimated by discounting the scheduled payment streams to
      present value based upon

rates
      currently available to us for similar
  debt.

(2)

Fair value was estimated by us to approximate
      carrying value or is based on current market
  information.

We
believe the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates the fair
value due to the short maturity of these instruments and have not been reflected
in the above table.

BUSINESS
      SEGMENTS

We are an
integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of
communications services to our customers, including local exchange, long
distance, Internet access and broadband services.  We strive to
maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service
offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated
communications services.  As a result of increased bundling of our
local exchange and long distance service offerings, beginning in 2006, we have
combined the revenues of such offerings into a category entitled
“Voice”.  Beginning in 2007, revenues from voice mail services
previously reflected in “Other” revenues were reclassified to “Voice”
revenues.  Prior periods have been restated to insure
comparability.

Our operating revenues for our products and services include the following

COMMITMENTS
      AND CONTINGENCIES

Construction
expenditures and investments in vehicles, buildings and equipment during 2008
are estimated to be $300 million.  We generally do not enter into
firm, committed contracts for such activities.

In

Barbrasue Beattie and James
Sovis, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, v. CenturyTel,
Inc.

, filed on October 28, 2002, in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan (Case No. 02-10277), the plaintiffs allege that
we unjustly and unreasonably billed customers for inside wire maintenance
services, and seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief under
various legal theories on behalf of a purported class of over two million
customers in our telephone markets.  On March 10, 2006, the Court
certified a class of plaintiffs and issued a ruling that the billing
descriptions we used for these services during an approximately 18-month period
between October 2000 and May 2002 were legally insufficient.  Our
appeal of this class certification decision was denied.  Our
preliminary analysis indicates that we billed less than $10 million for inside
wire maintenance services under the billing descriptions and time periods
specified in the District Court ruling described above.  Should other
billing descriptions be determined to be inadequate or if claims are allowed for
additional time periods, the amount of our potential exposure could increase
significantly.  The Court’s order does not specify the award of
damages, the scope and amounts of which, if any, remain subject to additional
fact-finding and resolution of what we believe are valid defenses to plaintiff’s
claims.  Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount or
range of possible loss at this time.  However, considering the
one-time nature of any adverse result, we do not believe that the ultimate
outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or on-going results of operations.

From time
to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business,
including administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating
primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, occasional
grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies and miscellaneous third
party tort actions.   The outcome of these other proceedings is
not predictable.  However, we do not believe that the ultimate
resolution of these other proceedings, after considering available insurance
coverage, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

(20)

SUBSEQUENT
      EVENT

In January 2008, we terminated all of
our existing “fixed to variable” interest rate swaps associated with the full
$500 million principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due
2012.  In connection with the termination of these derivatives, we
received an aggregate of approximately $25.6 million, which will be amortized as
a reduction of interest expense through 2012.

In addition, in January 2008 we also
terminated certain other derivatives that were not deemed to be effective
hedges.  Upon the termination of these derivatives, we paid an
aggregate of approximately $4.9 million.  We expect to record a $3.4
million pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2008 related to the settlement of
these derivatives.

The results of operations of
the Madison River properties are reflected in the above table subsequent to the
April 30, 2007 acquisition date.  In second quarter 2007, we recorded
$49 million of revenues upon the settlement of a dispute with a
carrier.  In third quarter 2007, we recognized $42.2 million of
revenues upon the expiration of a regulatory monitoring period.  In
fourth quarter 2007, we recognized a net benefit of approximately $32.7 million
after-tax related to the release of previously unrecognized tax
benefits.  In fourth quarter 2007, we recorded a pre-tax charge of
approximately $16.6 million related to the impairment of certain of our CLEC
assets.

The
first, second and third quarters of 2006 have been adjusted to reflect the
application of SAB 108 (see Note 1 for additional information).

The
fourth quarter of 2006 included an $11.7 million pre-tax charge related to the
impairment of certain non-operating investments.   The second
quarter of 2006 included a $117.8 million pre-tax gain recorded upon the
redemption of Rural Telephone Bank stock and a $6.4 million net tax benefit due
to the resolution of various income tax audit issues.

The fourth quarter of 2005 included a $6.3 million pre-tax charge related to the
impairment of a non-operating investment.  The third quarter of 2005
included the following amounts presented on a pre-tax basis: (i) the recognition
of $35.9 million of revenue as the settlement period related to the 2001/2002
monitoring period lapsed; (ii) $5.8 million of expenses related to Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita; (iii) a $9.9 million charge related to the impairment of a
non-operating investment; and (iv) a $3.5 million gain on the sale of a separate
non-operating investment.

Controls
      and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported as
required.  Our Chief Executive Officer, Glen F. Post, III, and our
Chief Financial Officer, R. Stewart Ewing, Jr., have evaluated our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007.  Based on the
evaluation, Messrs. Post and Ewing concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures have been effective in providing reasonable assurance that they have
been timely alerted of material information required to be filed in this annual
report.  Since the date of Messrs. Post’s and Ewing’s most recent
evaluation, there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or
in other factors that could significantly affect these controls.  The
design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events and contingencies, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals.  Because
of the inherent limitations in any control system, you should be aware that
misstatements due to error or fraud could occur and not be
detected.

Reports on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting.

We incorporate by reference into this
Item 9A the reports appearing at the forefront of Item 8, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data”.
