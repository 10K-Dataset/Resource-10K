Item 1.

BUSINESS.

(dollars and shares in thousands)

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders through the innovation, development and commercialization of life-transforming therapeutic products. Our marketed product Soliris

®

(eculizumab) is the first and only therapeutic approved for patients with two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system:  paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a life-threatening and ultra-rare genetic blood disorder, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a life-threatening and ultra-rare genetic disease. We are also evaluating additional potential indications for Soliris in severe and ultra-rare diseases in which chronic uncontrolled complement activation is the underlying mechanism, and we are progressing in various stages of development with additional biotechnology product candidates as treatments for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.  We were incorporated in 1992 and began commercial sale of Soliris in 2007.

Soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, transplant rejection and neurology. Soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that effectively blocks terminal complement activity at the doses


currently prescribed. The initial indication for which we received approval for Soliris is PNH. PNH is an ultra-rare, debilitating and life-threatening, genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by chronic uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). The chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life-threatening thromboses, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark-colored urine (hemoglobinuria).

Soliris was approved for the treatment of PNH by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission (EC) in 2007 and by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in 2010, and has been approved in several other territories. Additionally, Soliris has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories.

In September 2011, Soliris was approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with aHUS.  aHUS is a genetic ultra-rare disease characterized by chronic uncontrolled complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy, the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, causing a reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and life-threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart and other vital organs.  Also, in November 2011, the EC granted marketing authorization for Soliris to treat pediatric and adult patients with aHUS in Europe.  The FDA and EC have granted Soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with aHUS.

Significant Developments

Enobia Acquisition

On February 7, 2012, we acquired Enobia Pharma Corp. (Enobia), a privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Enobia's lead product candidate, asfotase alfa, is a human recombinant targeted alkaline phosphatase enzyme-replacement therapy for patients suffering with hypophosphatasia (HPP), an ultra-rare, life-threatening, genetic metabolic disease for which there are no approved treatments.  We agreed to make an upfront payment of

$610,000

subject to purchase price adjustments, which resulted in us making a cash payment of

$623,876

for 100% of Enobia's capital stock.  Additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of

$470,000

may be due upon reaching various regulatory and sales milestones.  We financed the acquisition with a combination of existing cash and proceeds from our credit facility.

Credit Facilities

On February 7, 2012, we and our wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Sàrl, entered into a Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent and RBS Citizens, National Association and Suntrust Bank as co-documentation agents.  The Credit Agreement provides for a

$240,000

senior secured term loan facility and a

$200,000

senior secured revolving credit facility, which includes up to a

$60,000

sublimit for letters of credit and a

$10,000

sublimit for swingline loans.  Alexion used the facilities to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Enobia.  The facilities can also be used for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.  Simultaneously with entering into the Credit Agreement, we terminated our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated March 7, 2011.

Common Stock Offering

In May 2012, in conjunction with our addition into the S&P 500 Index, we completed the sale of

5,000

shares of our common stock in a public offering.  The net proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering were

$462,212

.

Products and Development Programs

The human immune system defends the body from attack or invasion by infectious agents or pathogens. This is accomplished through a complex system of proteins and cells, primarily complement proteins, antibodies

and white blood cells, each with a specialized function. Under normal circumstances, complement proteins, together with antibodies and white blood cells, act to protect the body by removing:

•

harmful micro-organisms;

•

cells containing foreign proteins known as antigens; and

•

potential disease-causing combinations of antigens and antibodies known as immune complexes.


When activated by certain stimuli, the immune system triggers a series of enzymatic and biochemical reactions called the complement cascade that results in an inflammatory response. This inflammatory response is one of the immune system’s weapons against foreign pathogens or otherwise diseased tissue. However, under certain circumstances, the complement cascade may cause excessive or inappropriate activation, and/or an individual may be deficient in naturally occurring complement inhibitors, all of which may result in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions and damage to healthy tissues.

We focus our product development programs on life transforming therapeutics for diseases for which we believe current treatments are either non-existent or inadequate. Eculizumab is a humanized antibody known as a C5 terminal complement inhibitor (C5 Inhibitor), which is designed to selectively block the production of inflammation-causing proteins of the complement cascade. We believe that selective suppression of this immune response may provide a significant therapeutic advantage relative to existing therapies. In addition to PNH and aHUS, for which the use of eculizumab has been approved in the United States and Europe, we believe that C5 Inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of a variety of other serious diseases and conditions resulting from uncontrolled complement activation.

Our programs, including investigator sponsored clinical programs, include the following:

*

Investigator Initiated Trial

Our most advanced programs focus on two therapeutic areas:  hematology and nephrology.  We are also advancing our pipeline programs with a focus primarily on neurology and metabolic disorders.


Soliris (eculizumab)

Soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology including transplant rejection, and neurology. Soliris is a humanized antibody which, administered at the doses currently prescribed, generally blocks complement activity for one to two weeks after a single dose.

Soliris was approved for the treatment of PNH by the FDA and the EC in 2007, by Japan’s MHLW in 2010 and has been approved in several other territories. Additionally, Soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories.

Soliris was approved for the treatment of aHUS by the FDA and the EC in 2011.  Soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of aHUS in the United States and Europe.

Orphan drug designation generally entitles us to exclusivity for certain periods of time, subject to limited circumstances. However, if a competitive product that is the same as Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, is shown to be clinically superior to our product in the treatment of PNH, or if a competitive product is different from Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, the orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained may not restrict the approval of such competitive product.

Hematology

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)

PNH is an ultra-rare, debilitating and life-threatening blood disorder in which an acquired genetic deficiency causes uncontrolled complement activation which leads to life-threatening complications. Patients with PNH have an acquired genetic deficiency in certain protective proteins on the surface of their blood cells, allowing their own complement system to attack and destroy these blood cells. Patients with PNH suffer from chronic complement activation of some of their blood cells and also hemolysis, or destruction of red blood cells caused by the C5 cleavage product C5b-9. This hemolysis is believed to lead to further clinical complications including thromboses, kidney disease, liver dysfunction, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, recurrent pain, shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension, intermittent episodes of dark colored urine (hemoglobinuria), and anemia. Approximately one-half of the patients with PNH die from the disease within 10 to 15 years of diagnosis.

Our marketed product Soliris is the first and only therapy approved for the treatment of patients with PNH.  We continue to work with researchers to expand the base of knowledge in PNH and the utility of Soliris to treat patients with PNH.  Additionally, we are sponsoring multinational registries to gather information regarding the natural history of patients with PNH and the longer term outcomes during Soliris treatment.

Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD)

We are aware that dosing is ongoing in an investigator-initiated Phase II study of eculizumab in patients for the treatment of CAD.  CAD is a severe, ultra-rare complement-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of high concentrations of circulating complement-activating antibodies directed against red blood cells. As observed with PNH patients, CAD patients also suffer from the clinical consequences of severe hemolysis.

As blood is cooled during circulation through the distal parts of the arms and legs, specific antibodies bind to the red blood cells resulting in activation of the complement cascade and red blood cell lysis. Clinical manifestations of CAD include symptoms of chronic hemolysis such as fatigue, dyspnea, weakness, hemoglobinuria, kidney damage, pallor and jaundice. In the most severe cases, complications of progressive hemolysis or anemia may result in death. Current therapies, including cold avoidance, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, intravenous immunoglobulin G and chemotherapy agents are largely ineffective in controlling hemolysis in patients with CAD.

Hematology/Nephrology

Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)

aHUS is a  chronic and life-threatening ultra-rare genetic disease in which uncontrolled complement activation causes blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body (thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA) leading to kidney failure, stroke, heart attack and death.  Our marketed product Soliris is the first and only therapy approved for the treatment of patients with aHUS.


In patients with aHUS, deficiency of naturally occurring complement inhibitors causes uncontrolled complement activation which leads to systemic TMA, the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body causing a reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and life-threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart and other vital organs. The prognosis for patients with aHUS is generally poor. Approximately 70% of patients with the most common mutation experience chronic renal insufficiency, chronic dialysis, or death within one year after the first clinical manifestation of TMA. aHUS commonly recurs in patients who undergo renal transplantation and, depending upon the mutation, the disease can lead to loss of the transplanted kidney in up to approximately 90% of aHUS patients who undergo kidney transplantation.

Approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with aHUS have been identified to have genetic mutations in at least one of the complement control proteins or neutralizing autoantibodies to complement regulatory factors, which can lead to uncontrolled complement activation. Excessive complement activation may contribute to the blood vessel inflammation and clotting by stimulating activation of white blood cells, platelets and the endothelial lining of blood vessels.

As a post marketing requirement, we have now completed enrollment in a prospective open-label trial in adult aHUS and, separately, enrollment has been completed in a prospective pediatric aHUS study.

Nephrology

Shiga-toxin producing E. Coli Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome

(

STEC-HUS)

STEC-HUS is a life-threatening, complement-mediated ultra-rare disorder that results from exposure to Enterohemorrhagic E.Coli, (EHEC).  Our STEC-HUS development program was initiated in connection with the widespread outbreak of EHEC in Germany in May and June 2011. Many EHEC patients rapidly progressed to STEC-HUS during this outbreak.  As in several other conditions with severe and uncontrolled complement activation, including aHUS, complement activation in STEC-HUS results in TMA.  Although aHUS and STEC-HUS exhibit similar life-threatening TMA manifestations, aHUS and STEC-HUS are different disorders.  aHUS is a chronic genetic disease of uncontrolled complement activation, while STEC-HUS is not genetic and follows an isolated episode of infection.  STEC-HUS is an ultra-rare disorder, comprising only a small sub-set of the already rare population of patients with EHEC.  Following an authorization by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Germany's health care regulatory body for biologics, and an access program for patients initiated in May 2011, we initiated an open-label clinical trial to investigate eculizumab as a treatment for patients with STEC-HUS.  Enrollment in this trial has been completed.  The FDA and the EC have each granted orphan designation for eculizumab as a treatment for patients with STEC-HUS.

MPGN II/C3 Nephropathy

We are aware that independent investigators have completed enrollment in studies aimed at evaluating eculizumab in patients with membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN II or dense deposit disease) as well as patients with a similar disease referred to as C3 nephropathy.  MGPN II and C3 nephropathy are ultra-rare forms of glomerulonephritis, associated with genetic mutations in complement inhibitor genes leading to sustained uncontrolled complement activation and inflammation. Clinically, this disease is characterized by the onset of severe proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), often accompanied by nephrotic syndrome which is refractory to immunosuppressant therapy. In most cases, the disease progresses to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis and renal transplantation.

Acute Humoral Rejection (AHR) in Presensitized Kidney Transplant Patients

Patients undergoing solid organ transplantation may experience severe AHR in the early post-transplant period. For example, in a patient undergoing a kidney transplant this may be characterized by the acute onset of renal dysfunction and rapid progression to destruction of the transplanted kidney.

AHR results when antibodies in the transplant recipient vigorously attack the blood vessels of the donor kidney. During severe AHR, these donor specific antibodies bind to the blood vessel lining of the donor organ and initiate activation of the complement cascade, resulting in severe blood vessel inflammation and clotting. Administration of a C5 inhibitor in animal models of AHR inhibits complement activation, tissue damage and transplant rejection.


We initiated enrollment in a multi-national, multi-site controlled clinical trial of eculizumab in presensitized renal transplant patients at elevated risk for AHR who will receive living donor grafts, and we have initiated enrollment in a multi-national, multi-site controlled clinical trial of eculizumab in presensitized renal transplant patients at elevated risk for AHR who will receive deceased donor grafts.  We are also aware that an independent investigator has started enrolling patients in a clinical trial to evaluate eculizumab in kidney transplant patients sensitized to their donor kidney due to an ABO blood group mismatch between donor and recipient.

Delayed Kidney Transplant Graft Function

We are aware that dosing is ongoing in an investigator-initiated Phase II study of eculizumab in patients at elevated risk for delayed graft function (DGF) following kidney transplant.

DGF is the term used to describe the failure of a kidney or other organs to function immediately after transplantation due to ischemia-reperfusion and immunological injury.  After kidney transplantation, DGF can be considered a form of acute kidney injury post-transplantation and is an important complication of kidney transplantation. The frequency of DGF can be as high as 50% in some kidney transplant settings. DGF complicates post-transplant management, increases morbidity and prolongs patient hospitalization.  In addition to the acute kidney injury, DGF predisposes the transplanted kidney to both acute and chronic rejection and increases the risk of chronic allograft nephropathy and premature graft loss.  Studies have indicated that activation of the complement cascade may be a key early event required for the development of DGF following kidney transplant.  There are currently no accepted or approved therapies for prevention or treatment of DGF following kidney transplantation.

Neurology

Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)

NMO is a severe and ultra-rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. Individuals with NMO develop optic neuritis, which causes pain in the eye and vision loss, and transverse myelitis, which causes weakness, numbness, and sometimes paralysis of the arms and legs, weakness or paralysis of respiratory muscles sometimes leading to respiratory failure, along with sensory disturbances and loss of bladder and bowel control.

Preliminary data from the investigator-initiated Phase II clinical trial of eculizumab in severe and relapsing NMO patients was presented to the American Neurological Association (ANA) meeting in October 2012.  The study was reported to have achieved its primary efficacy endpoint with a high degree of clinical and statistical significance and several key secondary endpoints were also achieved.

Myasthenia Gravis (MG)

MG is an ultra-rare autoimmune syndrome characterized by complement activation leading to the failure of neuromuscular transmission. Patients with MG initially experience weakness in their ocular, or eye muscles, and the disease typically progresses to head, spinal, limb and respiratory muscles. Symptoms can include drooping eyelids, blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty chewing or swallowing, weakness in the arms and legs and difficulty breathing. In an experimental animal model of MG, administration of a C5 Inhibitor was found to prevent experimentally acquired MG and to inhibit disease progression.

Preliminary data from a Phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in patients with severe, refractory MG demonstrated an encouraging disease improvement signal and was presented at the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation Annual Meeting in September 2011. We continue to work with investigators to design the next clinical trial to evaluate eculizumab as a treatment for patients with severe and refractory MG.

Asfotase Alfa

Hypophosphatasia (HPP)

HPP is an ultra-rare, genetic, and life-threatening metabolic disease characterized by impaired phosphate and calcium regulation, leading to progressive damage to multiple vital organs including destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and respiratory failure.

The severe manifestations of the genetic deficiency in HPP affect people of all ages, and approximately 50% of infants with the disease do not survive past one year of age.

HPP is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme Tissue Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase. This enzyme normally breaks


down metabolic substrates such as inorganic pyrophosphate and pyridoxal phosphate.

Asfotase alfa, a targeted enzyme replacement therapy in Phase II clinical trials for patients with HPP, is designed to directly address the morbidities and mortality of HPP by targeting alkaline phosphatase directly to the deficient tissue. In this way, asfotase alfa is designed to normalize the genetically defective metabolic process and prevent or reverse the severe, crippling and life-threatening complications of dysregulated mineral metabolism in patients with HPP.  Initial studies with asfotase alfa in HPP patients indicate that the treatment significantly decreases the levels of targeted metabolic substrates.  We have initiated a natural history study in infants with HPP and are currently dosing patients in a separate global trial of severe infant HPP patients.  We acquired asfotase alfa in February 2012 in connection with our acquisition of Enobia.

cPMP

Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) Disease Type A (MoCD Type A)

MoCD Type A is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by severe and rapidly progressive neurologic damage and death in newborns.  MoCD Type A results from a genetic deficiency in cyclic Pyranopterin Monophosphate (cPMP), a molecule that enables production of certain enzymes, the absence of which allows neurotoxic sulfite to accumulate in the brain.  To date, there is no approved therapy available for MoCD Type A.  There has been some early clinical experience with the cPMP replacement therapy in a small number of children with MoCD Type A.  We are currently conducting pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) toxicology studies with cPMP replacement therapy.

ALXN 1102/1103

ALXN 1102/1103 is a novel alternative pathway complement inhibitor with a mechanism of action unique from Soliris.  ALXN 1102 is currently being investigated in a Phase I single dose, dose escalating safety and pharmacology study. ALXN 1103 is being dosed in the same Phase I trial as a subcutaneous formulation.

ALXN 1007

ALXN 1007 is a novel humanized antibody designed to target rare and severe inflammatory disorders and is a product of our proprietary antibody discovery technologies.  ALXN 1007 is currently being investigated in a Phase I single dose, dose escalating safety and pharmacology study in healthy volunteers.

Manufacturing

We currently rely on two manufacturing facilities, Alexion's Rhode Island manufacturing facility (ARIMF) and Lonza Group AG and its affiliates (Lonza), to produce commercial and clinical bulk quantities of Soliris, and we rely on Lonza for clinical quantities of asfotase alfa.  We produce our clinical and preclinical quantities of our other product candidates at ARIMF.  We also depend on a limited number of third party providers for other services with respect to our clinical and commercial requirements, including product finishing, packaging, vialing and labeling.

We have various agreements with Lonza, with remaining total commitments of approximately

$169,000

through 2018.  Such commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances.  If we terminate certain supply agreements with Lonza without cause, we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement.  Under an existing arrangement with Lonza, we also pay Lonza a royalty on sales of Soliris manufactured at ARIMF.

Sales and Marketing

We have established a commercial organization to support current and future sales of Soliris in the United States, in the major markets in European Union, Japan, Asia Pacific countries, and other territories. Our sales force for Soliris is small compared to that of other drugs with similar gross revenues; however, we believe that a relatively smaller sales force is appropriate to effectively market Soliris due to the limited PNH and aHUS patient populations. If we receive regulatory approval in new territories, we may expand our own commercial organizations in such territories and market and sell Soliris through our own sales force in these territories. However, we will evaluate each jurisdiction on a country-by-country basis, and it is possible that we will promote Soliris in collaboration with marketing partners or rely on relationships with one or more companies with established distribution systems and direct sales forces in certain countries.


Customers

In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. We also sell Soliris to government agencies. Outside the United States, our customers are primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers and distributors.

Because of factors such as the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from product sale to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights, Soliris customers generally carry limited inventory. We also monitor inventory within our sales channels to determine whether deferrals are appropriate based on factors such as inventory levels, contractual terms and financial strength of distributors.

Patents and Proprietary Rights

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Our practice is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our technologies that are considered important to the development of our business. We also rely upon our trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovations, as well as patents that we have licensed or may license from other parties, to develop and maintain our competitive position.

We have filed several U.S. patent applications and international counterparts of certain of these applications. In addition, we have in-licensed several additional U.S. and international patents and patent applications. As of

December 31, 2012

, we owned or in-licensed


U.S. patents and


U.S. patent applications. These patents and patent applications relate to technologies or products in the C5 Inhibitor program, high throughput screening, vectors, cancer, recombinant antibodies, bone delivery conjugates, natriuretic peptides, human molybdenum cofactor deficiency, targeted complement inhibitors, and other technologies. As of

December 31, 2012

, we owned or in-licensed


foreign patents and


pending foreign patent applications.

With respect to Soliris, we have an issued U.S. patent that will expire in 2021, taking into account patent term extension.  In Europe, a corresponding issued patent covering Soliris expires in 2015 and, taking into account the Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPC) that we have filed for in various European countries, exclusivity for Soliris will extend into 2020 in those countries in which an SPC is granted.  Patents covering Soliris in Japan and other countries expire between 2015 and 2020.  We owe royalties and other fees to owners of one or more patents in connection with the manufacture and sale of Soliris for PNH and aHUS, and we may owe royalties and fees to other third parties with respect to any previous or future manufacture and sale of Soliris and our product candidates.

We also own U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications for our product candidates other than Soliris.  At present, each such product candidate is in early stage development, and it is not known whether any such product candidate will ever be approved for human use and sale.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain U.S. and international patent protection for our products and development programs, to preserve our trade secrets and proprietary rights, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties or having third parties circumvent our rights. Because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace, the health care industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes. Significant legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the United States and other important markets outside of the United States. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that patent applications owned or licensed by us will issue as patents, or that any issued patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors. Moreover, once issued, patents are subject to challenge through both administrative and judicial proceedings in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Such proceedings include interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any litigation or administrative proceeding may result in a significant commitment of our resources and, depending on outcome, may adversely affect the validity and scope of certain of our patent or other proprietary rights.


We are aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the manufacture, use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, and recombinant human single chain antibodies. Soliris and many of our product candidates are either genetically engineered antibodies, including recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, or recombinant human single chain antibodies. We have received notices from the owners of patents claiming that their patents may be infringed by the development, manufacture or sale of Soliris or some of our drug candidates. For example, in January 2011, Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics, Inc. (Novartis) filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the manufacture of Soliris infringes their U.S. patent number 5,688,688. We are also aware of other patents owned by third parties that might be claimed by such third parties to be infringed by the development and commercialization of Soliris or some of our product candidates. In respect to some of these patents, we have obtained licenses, or expect to obtain licenses. However, with regard to such other patents, we have determined in our judgment that:

•

our products do not infringe the patents;

•

the patents are not valid; or

•

we have identified and are testing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents and which should permit commercialization of our product candidates.

If any patent holder successfully challenges our judgment that our products do not infringe their patents or that their patents are invalid, we could be required to pay costly damages or to obtain a license to sell or develop our drugs. A required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products, including Soliris.

On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant claim or legal proceeding and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our operating results.

It is our policy to require our employees, consultants and parties to collaborative agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships or collaborations with us. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law.

License Agreements

In March 1996, we entered into a license agreement with the Medical Research Council (MRC) whereby MRC granted to us worldwide non-exclusive rights to certain patents related to the humanization and production of monoclonal antibodies. We pay MRC royalties on a quarterly basis with respect to sales of Soliris. The royalty is payable until the expiration of the last patent covered by the license agreement, which is expected to be in 2015, except that royalties for sales in Canada will continue until January of 2017. MRC may terminate the license if we file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, or if we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement and such failure is not remedied within three months after delivery of notice. Under the agreement, we agreed to (a) make royalty payments with respect to sales of licensed products, (b) promote the sale of Soliris of good marketable quality, and (c) use reasonable endeavors to meet market demand for licensed products.

We are party to other license agreements related to the manufacture and sale of Soliris. Under an existing arrangement with Lonza, Lonza produces commercial and clinical bulk quantities of Soliris.  We pay Lonza royalties on a quarterly basis with respect to sales of Soliris manufactured at ARIMF.  We have various agreements with Lonza, with commitments through 2018.  Such commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances.  If we terminate certain supply agreements with Lonza without cause, we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement.

In October 2012, we entered into a settlement and non-exclusive license agreement with a third party.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of approximately

$38,000

in the fourth quarter of 2012 and will pay royalties on sales of Soliris in accordance with the terms of the agreement.


Government Regulation

The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, and marketing, among other things, of our products and product candidates, including Soliris, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, the European Union and other territories. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Soliris is regulated by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. Manufacturers of biologics may also be subject to state regulation. Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us and/or our partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution.

The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include:

(1) preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests;

(2) submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;

(3) adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product;

(4) submission to the FDA of a BLA or supplemental BLA;

(5) FDA pre-approval inspection of product manufacturers; and

(6) FDA review and approval of the BLA or supplemental BLA.

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practices. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA before that time raises concerns about the drug candidate or the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials or that once commenced, other concerns will not arise.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of qualified principal investigators. Each clinical study at each clinical site must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, prior to the recruitment of subjects.

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. Phase I studies may be conducted in a limited number of patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. The drug is usually tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmaco-dynamics and pharmaco-kinetics. Phase II usually involves studies in a larger, but still limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks.

Phase III trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA, sponsor or institutional review board may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. The BLA review fee alone can exceed $1,500, subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is typically reviewed for administrative completeness and


reviewability within 60 days following submission of the application. If found sufficiently complete, the FDA will “file” the BLA, thus triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA’s established goal is to review 90% of Priority BLA applications and original efficacy supplements within six months and 90% of Standard applications and original efficacy supplements in ten months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a drug within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change from time to time because the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.  As part of its review, the FDA may refer the BLA to an advisory committee for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.  Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations.

Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but instead a “complete response letter” communicating the FDA's decision not to approve the application, outlining the deficiencies in the BLA, and identifying what information and/or data (including additional pre-clinical or clinical data) is required before the application can be approved. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA still does not meet the standards for approval.  Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than us.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can delay the approval process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval will impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, and may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies (REMS), or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. To market a product for other indicated uses, or to make certain manufacturing or other changes requires FDA review and approval of a BLA Supplement or new BLA. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product may be required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.

In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI) was enacted, creating a statutory pathway  for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, reference biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act. Also under the BPCI, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusive use before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. This means that the FDA may not approve a biosimilars application until 12 years after the date of approval of the original reference biological product date (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results reported to FDA), although a biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date of approval of the original reference biological product.

The objectives of the BPCI are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the ‘Hatch-Waxman Act, which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of small molecule drug products. The implementation of an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products is under the direction of the FDA and is currently being developed. In February of 2012, the FDA published draft guidance documents on biosimilar product development.  The guidance defines a biosimilar as a biological product that is highly similar to an already approved biological product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the approved biological product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency.  Under this proposed approval pathway, biological products are approved based on demonstrating they are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a biological product that is already approved by the FDA, which is called a reference product.  The approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material impact on our business because it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products.

Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not satisfied or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw its product approval or take actions that would suspend marketing.  For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines,


civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance.

The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies also closely regulate the promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.  A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved.  After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA.  Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses - that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug's labeling - because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine.  However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses.  Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under certain conditions.  Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities.  This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.

Orphan Drug Designation in the United States, the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or supplemental BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to an orphan exclusivity period, in which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances.

Medicinal products used to treat life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union and medicinal products which, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives may be granted an orphan designation in the European Union. The application for orphan designation is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before an application is made for marketing authorization. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the European Union member states nor the EMA are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same orphan indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.

Soliris has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in the United States and in several other territories, including the European Union, Australia and South Korea, which provides certain regulatory and filing fee advantages, including market exclusivity, except in limited circumstances, for several years after approval. In 2009, Soliris also received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with aHUS in the United States and the European Union.  Soliris received marketing authorization for the treatment of PNH in 2007 and for aHUS in 2011.  In 2008, asfotase alfa received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with hypophosphatasia in the United States and the European Union.

Foreign Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above, as well as additional country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from


country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

For example, in the European Union, applications for marketing authorization are based on the ICH Common Technical Document and must include a demonstration that the applicant has conducted studies with the medicinal product in the pediatric population as provided by a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA. Alternatively, confirmation that the applicant has been granted a waiver or deferral for the conduct of these studies must be provided.

Under the European Union regulatory system, we may submit applications for marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized marketing authorization procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the EC on the basis of an opinion by the EMA. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all European Union member states and three of the four EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure apply between European Union member states. The decentralized marketing authorization procedure involves the submission of an application for marketing authorization to the approval authority of all European Union member states in which the product is to be marketed. One national approval authority, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The authorities of the other European Union member states subsequently decide whether to grant or refuse marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of marketing authorizations delivered by the national approval authorities of European Union member states by the approval authorities of other European Union member states. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the approval authority of a European Union member state requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the approval authority of another European Union member state.

Similarly to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual European Union member states both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. This includes control of compliance by these entities with European Union cGMP rules.

Failure to comply with European Union laws and the related national laws of individual European Union member states governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, refusal to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorization, fines and criminal penalties.

We submitted our Marketing Authorization Application for Soliris for the treatment of PNH and aHUS to the EMA using the centralized marketing authorization procedure.

The European Union has had an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars since 2005 and has approved several biosimilar products.  The approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products marketed in the European Union could have a material impact on our business. The biologic product biosimilar may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products.

Reimbursement

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and other third party payers. All third party payers are sensitive to the cost of drugs and have taken efforts to control those costs and will continue to do so in the future.  Private health insurance plans may restrict coverage of some products by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co-payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and by using utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or prior failure on another type of treatment. Payers may especially impose these obstacles to coverage for higher priced drugs, and consequently Soliris may be subject to payer-driven restrictions.

Medicare is a government insurance program for U.S. citizens age 65 and older and younger individuals with disabilities.  For Medicare beneficiaries, Soliris may be covered under Part B, which reimburses physicians and hospital outpatient departments for furnishing drugs, or Part A, which is the inpatient hospital benefit.  Under Part B, reimbursement is based on average sales price (ASP).  Manufacturers must report ASP information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), on a quarterly basis.  In the physician office setting, the reimbursement rate for drugs and biologics is ASP + 6%.  For 2013, in the hospital outpatient department setting, the reimbursement rate for drugs and biologics is ASP + 6%.  This reimbursement rate may decrease in the future.  In both settings, the reimbursement rate is updated quarterly based on the


submission of new ASP information.  Hospital inpatient services are covered under Medicare Part A.  Hospitals typically receive a single payment for an inpatient stay depending on the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) to which the inpatient stay is assigned.  The MS-DRG for a hospital inpatient stay varies based on the patient's condition.  In general, hospitals do not receive separate payment for drugs and biologicals administered to patients during a hospital stay.

Medicaid is a government insurance program for certain low-income individuals, including children.  It is jointly funded by the federal and state governments and it is administered by the states within parameters established by the federal government.  Coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics thus varies by state.  Drugs and biologics may be covered under the medical or pharmacy benefit.  State Medicaid programs may impose utilization management controls, such as prior authorization, step therapy, or quantity limits on drugs and biologics.  As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability of 2010 (collectively, the PPACA), many states are expanding their Medicaid programs.  The manner in which this expansion occurs may affect beneficiary access to prescription drugs and the types of utilization management controls that apply.

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union the sole legal instrument at the European Union level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC (the Price Transparency Directive). The aim of the Price Transparency Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in European Union member states are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the European Union and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not, however, provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual European Union member states. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing or levels of reimbursement in individual European Union member states. The national authorities of the individual European Union member states are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use. Individual European Union member states adopt policies according to which a specific price or level of reimbursement is approved for the medicinal product. Other European Union member states adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements and reference pricing mechanisms.

Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some European Union member states. These countries include the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Sweden. The HTA process in the European Union member states is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.

The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual European Union member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of a specific medicinal product vary between the European Union member states.

In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the European Union level. This Directive concerns the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the European Union. It also provides for the establishment of a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual European Union member states. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA and their impact on pricing and reimbursement decisions between European Union member states.

On a continuous basis, we engage with appropriate authorities on the operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes that are separately required in each country.


Competition

There are currently no approved drugs other than Soliris for the treatment of PNH and aHUS. However, many companies, including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies as well as specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in activities similar to our activities. Universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research and may market commercial products on their own or through joint ventures. Many of these entities may have:

•

substantially greater financial and other resources;

•

larger research and development staffs;

•

lower labor costs; and/or

•

more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations.

Many of these companies and organizations have significant experience in preclinical testing, human clinical trials, product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution and other regulatory approval and commercial procedures. They may also have a greater number of significant patents and greater legal resources to seek remedies for cases of alleged infringement of their patents by us to block, delay or compromise our own drug development process.

We compete with large pharmaceutical companies that produce and market synthetic compounds and with specialized biotechnology firms in the United States, Europe and in other countries and regions, as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies that are applying biotechnology to their operations. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us; in some instances, these products have already entered clinical trials or are already being marketed. Other companies are engaged in research and development based on complement proteins.

Several companies have either publicly announced their intentions to develop drugs which target the inflammatory effects of complement in the immune system or have had programs to develop complement inhibitor therapies. We believe that our potential C5 Inhibitors differ substantially from those of our potential competitors due to our compounds’ demonstrated ability to specifically intervene in the complement cascade, for potentially prolonged periods of time. We believe this action to be the optimal point so that the disease-causing actions of complement proteins are inhibited, while the normal disease-preventing functions of complement proteins and other aspects of immune function remain intact.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

(amounts in thousands, except percentages)

You should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in Alexion and our business because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Lead Product Soliris

We depend heavily on the success of our lead product, Soliris. If we are unable to increase sales of Soliris, or obtain approval or commercialize Soliris in new territories for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or for additional indications, or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.

Our ability to generate revenues will continue to depend on commercial success of Soliris in the United States, Europe, Japan and in a number of key markets in the rest of the world and whether physicians, patients and health care payers view Soliris as therapeutically effective and safe relative to cost.  Since we launched Soliris in the United States in April 2007, essentially all of our revenue has been attributed to sales of Soliris, and we expect that Soliris product sales will continue to contribute to a significant percentage or almost all of our total revenue over the next several years.

In September and November 2011 we obtained marketing approval in the United States and the European Union, respectively, for Soliris for the treatment of a second indication, aHUS.

We dedicate significant resources to the worldwide commercialization of Soliris.  We have established sales and marketing capabilities in the United States and in many countries throughout the world.  We cannot guarantee that any marketing application for Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or any other indication, will be approved or maintained in any country where we seek marketing authorization to sell Soliris.  In certain countries, we continue discussions with authorities to finalize operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes so that we may, upon conclusion of such discussions, commence commercial sales of Soliris for the treatment of PNH in those countries.  We have and will continue to commence similar discussions with authorities to facilitate the commercialization of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS in certain countries in the European Union.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain reimbursement for Soliris or successfully commercialize Soliris in any additional countries, or that we will be able to maintain coverage or reimbursement at anticipated levels in any country in which we have already received marketing approval.  As a result, sales in certain countries may be delayed or never occur, or may be subsequently reduced.

The commercial success of Soliris and our ability to generate and increase revenues will depend on several factors, including the following:

•

receipt of marketing approvals for Soliris for the treatment of PNH in new territories and the maintenance of marketing approvals for the treatment of PNH in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories;

•

receipt and maintenance of marketing approvals for Soliris for the treatment of aHUS in Japan and other territories and the maintenance of the marketing approval in the United States and the European Union;

•

the number of patients with PNH and aHUS, and the number of those patients who are diagnosed with PNH and aHUS and identified to us;

•

the number of patients with PNH and aHUS that may be treated with Soliris;

•

successful continuation of commercial sales in the United States, Japan and in European countries where we are already selling Soliris for the treatment of PNH, and successful launch in countries where we have not yet obtained, or only recently obtained, marketing approval or commenced sales;

•

successfully launching commercial sales of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS in the United States and Europe, and in countries where we have not yet obtained marketing approval;

•

our ability to obtain sufficient coverage or reimbursement by third-party payers and our ability to maintain coverage or reimbursement at anticipated levels;


•

acceptance of Soliris and maintenance of safety and efficacy in the medical community;

•

establishment and maintenance of commercial manufacturing capabilities ourselves or through third-party manufacturers; and

•

our ability to develop, register and commercialize Soliris for indications other than PNH, including aHUS.

If we are not successful in increasing sales of Soliris in the United States, Europe and Japan and commercializing in the rest of the world, or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, we may experience surplus inventory, our business may be materially harmed and we may need to significantly curtail operations.

Because the target patient populations of Soliris for the treatment of PNH and aHUS are small and have not been definitively determined, we must be able to successfully identify patients and achieve a significant market share in order to maintain profitability and growth.

PNH and aHUS are each ultra-rare diseases with small patient populations that have not been definitively determined.  There can be no guarantee that any of our programs will be effective at identifying patients and the number of patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with Soliris, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.

If we are unable to obtain, or maintain at anticipated levels, reimbursement for Soliris from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, our pricing may be affected or our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.

We may not be able to sell Soliris on a profitable basis or our profitability may be reduced if we are required to sell our product at lower than anticipated prices or reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount. Soliris is significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments and almost all patients require some form of third party coverage to afford its cost.  Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States or country specific governmental organizations, and private third-party payers to defray the cost of Soliris to patients.  These entities may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to Soliris, determine to provide a lower level of coverage and reimbursement than anticipated, or reduce previously approved levels of coverage and reimbursement, including in the form of higher mandatory rebates or modified pricing terms.  In any such case, our pricing or reimbursement for Soliris may be affected and our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.

In certain countries where we sell or are seeking or may seek to commercialize Soliris, including certain countries where we both sell Soliris for the treatment of PNH and sell or seek to commercialize Soliris for the treatment of aHUS, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authority, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control. We may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us, or such coverage, pricing, and reimbursement may differ in separate regions in the same country.  In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country, and we cannot guarantee that we will have the capabilities or resources to successfully conclude the necessary processes and commercialize Soliris in every or even most countries in which we seek to sell Soliris.  Reimbursement sources are different in each country and in each country may include a combination of distinct potential payers, including private insurance and governmental payers.

For example, the European Union member states' authorities may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and adopt additional measures to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  This includes the use of reference pricing and HTA. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. These elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The national authorities of some European Union  member states may from time to time approve a specific price for the medicinal product.  Others may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the national market.  Some countries have or may seek to impose limits on the aggregate reimbursement for Soliris or for the use of Soliris for certain indications.  In such cases, our commercial operations in such countries and our results of operations and our business are and may be adversely affected.  Our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to successfully and timely conclude reimbursement, price approval or funding processes and market Soliris in such foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for Soliris is limited or reduced.  If we are not able to obtain coverage, pricing or reimbursement on terms acceptable to us or at all, or if such terms should change in any foreign


countries, we may not be able to or we may determine not to sell Soliris for one or more indications in such countries, or we could decide to sell Soliris at a lower than anticipated price in such countries, and our revenues may be adversely affected as a result.

The potential increase in the number of patients receiving Soliris may cause third-party payers to modify or limit coverage or reimbursement for Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS, or both indications.

Changes in pricing or the amount of reimbursement in countries where we currently commercialize Soliris may also reduce our profitability and worsen our financial condition.  In the United States, the European Union member states, and elsewhere, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, efforts to control and reduce health care costs. Government and other third-party payers in the United States and the European Union member states are challenging the prices charged for health care products and increasingly limiting and attempting to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs. For example, during 2010 the German government adopted legislation to increase mandatory discounts on pharmaceutical products and impose a temporary freeze on pharmaceutical pricing, including Soliris.  A significant reduction in the amount of reimbursement or pricing for Soliris in one or more countries may have a material adverse effect on our business.  See additional discussion below under the headings “Government initiatives that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products could adversely affect our business” and “The credit and financial market conditions may aggravate certain risks affecting our business.”  In addition, certain countries establish pricing and reimbursement amounts by reference to the price of the same or similar products in other countries.  If coverage or the level of reimbursement is limited in one or more countries, we may be unable to obtain or maintain anticipated pricing or reimbursement in current or new territories.

Many third-party payers cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such payer more expensive for patients, and require prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug.  Third-party payers may be especially likely to impose these obstacles to coverage for higher-priced drugs such as Soliris.

Even in countries where patients have access to insurance, their insurance co-payment amounts or annual or lifetime caps on reimbursements may represent a barrier to obtaining or continuing Soliris.  We have financially supported non-profit organizations which assist patients in accessing treatment for PNH and aHUS, including Soliris.  Such organizations assist patients whose insurance coverage leaves them with prohibitive co-payment amounts or other expensive financial obligations.  Such organizations' ability to provide assistance to patients is dependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be provided at adequate levels, if at all.  We have also provided Soliris without charge to patients who have no insurance coverage for drugs for related charitable purposes.  We are not able to predict the financial impact of the support we may provide for these and other charitable purposes; however, substantial support could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in the future.

We are also focusing development efforts on the use of eculizumab for the treatment of additional diseases.  The success of these programs depends on many factors, including those described under the heading "Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates."  As eculizumab is approved by regulatory agencies for indications other than PNH, the potential increase in the number of patients receiving Soliris may cause third-party payers to refuse coverage or reimbursement for Soliris for the treatment of PNH or for any other approved indication, or provide a lower level of coverage or reimbursement than anticipated or currently in effect.

We may not be able to gain or maintain market acceptance among the medical community or patients, which would prevent us from maintaining profitability or growth in the future.

We cannot be certain that Soliris will gain or maintain market acceptance in a particular country among physicians, patients, health care payers, and others.  Although we have received regulatory approval for Soliris in certain territories, including the United States, Japan and the European Union, such approvals do not guarantee future revenue.  We cannot predict whether physicians, other health care providers, government agencies or private insurers will determine or continue to accept that Soliris is safe and therapeutically effective relative to its cost.  Medical doctors' willingness to prescribe, and patients' willingness to accept, Soliris depends on many factors, including prevalence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use, effectiveness of our marketing strategy and the pricing of Soliris, publicity concerning Soliris, our other product candidates or competing products, our ability to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or reimbursement, and availability of alternative treatments, including bone marrow transplant as an alternative treatment for PNH. The likelihood of medical doctors to prescribe Soliris for patients with aHUS may also depend on how quickly Soliris can be delivered to the hospital or clinic and our distribution methods may not be sufficient to satisfy this need. If Soliris fails to achieve or maintain market acceptance among the medical community or patients in a particular country, we may not be able to market and sell it successfully in such country, which would limit our ability to generate revenue and could harm our overall business.


If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with continuing United States and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market Soliris or our manufacturers could lose their approvals to manufacture Soliris, and our business would be seriously harmed.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our regulatory approvals for Soliris.  If we do not maintain our regulatory approvals for Soliris, the value of our company and our results of operations will be materially harmed.  We and our current and future partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal and state agencies, and governmental authorities in other territories.  These regulations continue to apply after product approval, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, finishing, vialing, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk mitigation, adverse event reporting requirements, and export of biologics.  For example, the risk management program established in 2007 upon the FDA's approval of Soliris for the treatment of PNH was replaced with a REMS program, approved by the FDA in 2010.  The REMS program requires mandatory physician certification in the United States.  Each physician must certify that the physician is aware of the potential risks associated with the administration of Soliris and that the physician will inform each patient of these risks using educational material approved by the FDA.

As a condition of approval for marketing Soliris, governmental authorities may require us to conduct additional studies.  For example, in connection with the approval of Soliris in the United States, European Union and Japan, for the treatment of PNH, we agreed to establish a PNH Registry, monitor immunogenicity, monitor compliance with vaccination requirements, and determine the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal among PNH patients receiving eculizumab, and, specifically in Japan, we agreed to conduct a trial in a limited number of Japanese PNH patients to evaluate the safety of a meningococcal vaccine.  Further, in connection with the approval of Soliris in the United States for the treatment of aHUS, we agreed to establish an aHUS Registry and complete additional human clinical studies in adult and pediatric patients.  In the United States, for example, the FDA can propose to withdraw approval for a product if it determines that such additional studies are inadequate or if new clinical data or information shows that a product is not safe for use in an approved indication.  We are required to report any serious and unexpected adverse experiences and certain quality problems with Soliris to the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union member states, MHLW, and certain other health agencies.  We or any health agency may have to notify health care providers of any such developments.

The discovery of any previously unknown problems with Soliris, a manufacturer or a facility may result in restrictions on Soliris, a manufacturer or a facility, including withdrawal of Soliris from the market, batch failures, or interruption of production.  Certain changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often require prior regulatory approval before the product as modified may be marketed.  Our manufacturing and other facilities and those of any third parties manufacturing Soliris will be subject to inspection prior to grant of marketing approval by each regulatory authority where we seek marketing approval and subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the regulatory authorities.  We and any third party we would use to manufacture Soliris for sale, including Lonza, must also be licensed by applicable regulatory authorities.

Failure to comply with the laws and requirements, including statutes and regulations, administered by the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union member states, the MHLW or other agencies, could result in:

•

a product recall or withdrawal;

•

significant administrative and judicial sanctions, including, warning letters or untitled letters;

•

significant fines and other civil penalties;

•

suspension or withdrawal of a previously granted approval for Soliris;

•

interruption of production;

•

operating restrictions, such as a shutdown of production facilities or production lines;

•

suspension of ongoing clinical trials;

•

delays in approving or refusal to approve Soliris or a facility that manufactures Soliris;

•

seizing or detaining product;

•

injunctions; and/or

•

criminal prosecution.


If the use of Soliris harms people, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to Soliris, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.

The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of drugs for use in humans exposes us to product liability risks.  Side effects and other problems from using Soliris could (1) lessen the frequency with which physicians decide to prescribe Soliris, (2) encourage physicians to stop prescribing Soliris to their patients who previously had been prescribed Soliris, (3) cause serious adverse events and give rise to product liability claims against us, and (4) result in our need to withdraw or recall Soliris from the marketplace.  Some of these risks are unknown at this time.

We tested Soliris in only a small number of patients.  The FDA marketing approval for the treatment of patients with aHUS was based on two prospective studies in a total of 37 adult and adolescent patients, together with a retrospective study that included 19 pediatric patients.  PNH and aHUS are ultra-rare diseases.  As more patients use Soliris, including more children and adolescents, new risks and side effects may be discovered, the rate of known risks or side effects may increase, and risks previously viewed as less significant could be determined to be significant.  Previously unknown risks and adverse effects of Soliris may also be discovered in connection with unapproved uses of Soliris, which may include administration of Soliris under acute emergency conditions, such as the Enterohemorrhagic E. coli health crisis in Europe, primarily Germany, that began in May 2011.  We do not promote, or in any way support or encourage the promotion of Soliris for unapproved uses in violation of applicable law, but physicians are permitted to use products for unapproved purposes and we are aware of such  uses of Soliris.  In addition, we are studying and expect to continue to study Soliris in diseases other than PNH and aHUS in controlled clinical settings, and independent investigators are doing so as well.  In the event of any new risks or adverse effects discovered as new patients are treated for approved indications and as Soliris is studied in or used by patients for other indications, regulatory authorities may delay or revoke their approvals, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials and safety studies, make changes in labeling of Soliris, reformulate Soliris or make changes and obtain new approvals for our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities. We may also experience a significant drop in the potential sales of Soliris, experience harm to our reputation and the reputation of Soliris in the marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions.  Any of these results could decrease or prevent any sales of Soliris or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing Soliris.

We may be sued by people who use Soliris, whether as a prescribed therapy, during a clinical trial, during an investigator initiated study, or otherwise.  Many patients who use Soliris are already very ill.  Any informed consents or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our trials or use Soliris may not protect us from liability or litigation.  Our product liability insurance may not cover all potential types of liabilities or may not cover certain liabilities completely.  Moreover, we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms.  In addition, negative publicity relating to the use of Soliris or a product candidate, or to a product liability claim, may make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to market and sell Soliris.  As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Patients who use Soliris already often have severe and advanced stages of disease and known as well as unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks, including, for example, bone marrow failure, kidney failure and thrombosis.  During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to Soliris.  Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market Soliris, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts.  Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to Soliris, the investigation into the circumstance may be time consuming or inconclusive.  These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals Soliris receives or maintains.

Some patients treated with Soliris for PNH and other diseases, including patients who have participated in our clinical trials, have died or suffered potentially life-threatening diseases either during or after ending their Soliris treatments.  In particular, use of C5 Inhibitors, such as Soliris, is associated with an increased risk for certain types of infection, including meningococcal infection. Serious cases of meningococcal infection can result in severe illness, including but not limited to brain damage, loss of limbs or parts of limbs, kidney failure, or death. Under controlled settings, patients in our eculizumab trials all receive vaccination against meningococcal infection prior to first administration of Soliris and patients who are prescribed Soliris in most countries are required by prescribing guidelines to be vaccinated prior to receiving their first dose.  A physician may not have the opportunity to timely vaccinate a patient in the event of an acute emergency episode, such as in a patient presenting with aHUS or during the health crisis that began in May 2011 in Europe, principally in Germany, due to the epidemic of infections from Enterohemorrhagic E.coli.  Vaccination does not, however, eliminate all risk of meningococcal infection.  Additionally, in some countries there may not be any vaccine approved for general use or approved for use in infants and children.  Some patients treated with Soliris who had been vaccinated have nonetheless experienced meningococcal infection, including patients who have suffered serious illness or death.  Each such incident is required to be reported to


appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations.

We are also aware of a potential risk for PNH patients who delay a dose of Soliris or discontinue their treatment of Soliris. Treatment with Soliris blocks complement and allows complement-sensitive PNH red blood cells to increase in number. If treatment with Soliris is thereafter delayed or discontinued, a greater number of red blood cells therefore would become susceptible to destruction when the patient's complement system is no longer blocked. The rapid destruction of a larger number of a patient's red blood cells may lead to numerous complications, including death. Several PNH patients in our studies of Soliris have received delayed doses or discontinued their treatment. In none of those circumstances were significant complications shown to be due to rapid destruction of a larger number of PNH red blood cells; however, we have not studied the delay or termination of treatment in enough patients to determine that such complications in the future are unlikely to occur. Additionally, such delays or discontinuations may be associated with significant complications without evidence of such rapid cell destruction.

We are aware of a risk for aHUS patients who delay or miss a dose of Soliris or discontinue their treatment of Soliris.  Treatment with Soliris blocks complement and inhibits complement-mediated TMA.  After missing a dose or discontinuing Soliris, blood clots may form in small blood vessels throughout the body, causing a reduction in platelet count.  The reduction in platelet count may lead to numerous complications, including changes in mental status, seizures, angina, thrombosis, renal failure or even death.  In our aHUS clinical studies, such TMA complications were observed in some patients who missed a dose.

Clinical evaluations of outcomes in the post-marketing setting are required to be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations.  Determination of significant complications associated with the delay or discontinuation of Soliris could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell Soliris.

Although we obtained regulatory approval to market and sell Soliris for PNH and aHUS in the United States and European Union, and Soliris for PNH in Japan and other territories, we cannot guarantee that we will obtain the regulatory approval or reimbursement approval for Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or other diseases in each territory where we seek approvals.

Governments in countries where we seek to commercialize Soliris regulate the distribution of drugs and the facilities where such drugs are manufactured, and obtaining their approvals can be lengthy, expensive and highly uncertain.  The approval process varies from country to country, and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.  In certain jurisdictions, we are required to finalize operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes prior to marketing our products, even in countries where marketing approval has been obtained.  We have received regulatory approval for Soliris for treatment of patients with PNH in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories.  In September and November 2011 we received regulatory approval for Soliris for the treatment of patients with aHUS in the United States and the European Union, respectively.  We may not receive regulatory approval for Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or any other disease in any other territories on a timely basis, if ever.

Regulatory agencies may require additional information or data with respect to our submissions for Soliris, including the marketing authorization applications submitted to the EMA for the treatment of patients with aHUS.  We may have to conduct additional lengthy clinical testing and other costly and time-consuming procedures to satisfy foreign regulatory agencies.  Even with approval of Soliris in certain countries, the regulatory agencies in other countries may not agree with our interpretations of our clinical trial data for Soliris and may decide that our results are not adequate to support approval for marketing of Soliris.  In those circumstances, we would not be able to obtain regulatory approval in such country on a timely basis, if ever.  Even if approval is granted in such country, the approval may require limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.  The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as country-specific regulations.  We must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities and ethics committees of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.  We were required to conduct clinical studies with Soliris in patients with PNH in Japan prior to obtaining marketing approval in that country and Japanese authorities could require additional studies in Japan for Soliris for the treatment of patients with aHUS.  We are also conducting prospective clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients to confirm the benefit of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS.  Commercialization of Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or any other indication could be delayed, limited or may not occur in territories where we seek marketing approval if the applicable regulatory agency requires additional information or data.


Our commercialization of Soliris may be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if we or any other third party provider fails to provide sufficient quantities of Soliris. Commercial quantities of Soliris can only be manufactured at two facilities, including our own facility in Rhode Island.  Vial filling can only be performed at two third party facilities.

Commercial quantities of Soliris are manufactured by us at ARIMF and by Lonza. Manufacturing processes must comply with applicable regulations and manufacturing practices, as well as our own quality standards. In particular, the manufacture of Soliris is heavily regulated by governmental authorities around the world, including the FDA, EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union member states, and MHLW. If we or our third-party providers, including our product vialers, packagers and labelers, fail to comply fully with such regulations then we may be required to initiate a recall or withdrawal of our products or regulatory agencies could take action that leads to product shortages.  Such action may include:

•

issuing warning or untitled letters;

•

requiring corrective action or restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;

•

ordering shutdown of production facilities or production lines;

•

seizing or detaining product;

•

suspending or withdrawing the approval of Soliris;

•

imposing significant civil penalties and criminal fines;

•

suspending ongoing clinical studies for Soliris; and

•

refusing to approve pending BLAs or BLA supplements for Soliris.

The manufacture of Soliris is difficult.  Manufacture of a biologic requires a multi-step controlled process and even minor problems or deviations could result in defects or failures.  We cannot be certain that we, Lonza or our other third party providers will be able to perform uninterrupted supply chain services. The failure to manufacture appropriate supplies of Soliris, on a timely basis, or at all, may prevent or interrupt the commercialization of Soliris.  If we, Lonza or our other third party providers were unable to manufacture Soliris for any period, or if we, Lonza or our other third party providers do not obtain approval for the manufacturing of Soliris in the respective facility by the applicable regulatory agencies, we may incur substantial loss of sales.  If we are forced to find an alternative supplier or other third party providers for Soliris, in addition to loss of sales, we may also incur significant costs and experience significant delay in establishing a new arrangement.

We are authorized to sell product that is manufactured at ARIMF  in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other territories.  However, we will not be capable of manufacturing Soliris at ARIMF for commercial sale in certain other territories until such time as we have received the required regulatory approval for our facility, if ever.  We will continue to depend entirely on one company, Lonza, to manufacture Soliris for commercial sale in such other territories until that time.

In September and November 2011 we received marketing approval for Soliris for the treatment of patients with aHUS in the United States and European Union, respectively.  If Soliris is approved in other territories for the treatment of patients with aHUS, or for additional indications, we expect that the demand for Soliris will increase.  We may underestimate demand, or experience product interruptions at ARIMF, Lonza or a facility of a third party provider, including as a result of risks and uncertainties described in this report.  If we, Lonza or our other third party providers do not manufacture sufficient quantities of Soliris to satisfy demand, our business will be materially harmed.

We depend on a very limited number of third party providers for other services with respect to our clinical and commercial requirements, including product finishing, packaging, vialing and labeling.  We have changed or added third party vialers in the past in order to support uninterrupted supply, and may do so in the future.  We currently rely on two third party vialers to support our commercial requirements in the United States and the European Union, and a single third party vialer to support requirements in Japan.   No guarantee can be made that any third party vialer will be able to perform such services for sufficient product volumes for any country or territory. We do not have control over any third party provider's compliance with our internal or external specifications or the rules and regulations of the FDA, EMA, competent authorities of the European Union member states, MHLW or any other applicable regulations or standards.  In the past, we have had to write off and incur other charges and expenses for production that failed to meet requirements.  Any difficulties or delays in our third party manufacturing of Soliris, or any failure of our third party providers to comply with our internal and external specifications or any applicable rules, regulations and standards could increase our costs, constrain our ability to satisfy demand for Soliris from customers, cause us to lose revenue or incur penalties for failure to deliver product, make us postpone or cancel clinical trials, or cause our products to be recalled or withdrawn.

Many additional factors could cause production interruptions at ARIMF or at the facilities of Lonza or our third party providers, including natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war, human error, equipment malfunctions, contamination, or raw material shortages.  The occurrence of any such event could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for Soliris, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.


We are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or significant reduction or cancellation in sales to, any one of these customers could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

For the year ended December 31, 2012

, our largest customer accounted for

21%

of our global Soliris net product sales, and our three largest customers accounted for approximately

41%

of our global net product sales.  As of

December 31, 2012

, our single largest customer accounted for

18%

of the global accounts receivable balance.  We expect such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future.  We typically sell Soliris to third party distributors, such as specialty pharmacies, who in turn sell to patient health care providers.  We do not promote Soliris to these distributors, and they do not set or determine demand for Soliris.  Our ability to successfully commercialize Soliris will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to provide adequate distribution of Soliris to patients. Although a number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies, which supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics, home health care providers, and governmental organizations, distribute Soliris, they generally carry a very limited inventory and may be reluctant to distribute Soliris in the future if demand for the product does not increase.  Further, it is possible that our distributors could decide to change their policies or fees, or both, at some time in the future.  This could result in their refusal to distribute smaller volume products such as Soliris, or cause higher product distribution costs, lower margins or the need to find alternative methods of distributing our product.  Although we believe we can find alternative distributors on a relatively short notice, our revenue during that period of time may suffer and we may incur additional costs to replace a distributor.  The loss of any large customer, a significant reduction in sales we make to them, any cancellation of orders they have made with us or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

If we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will be unable to successfully commercialize Soliris.

We are marketing and selling Soliris ourselves in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories.  If we are unable to establish and/or expand our capabilities to sell, market and distribute Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or, if approved by the necessary regulatory agencies, other future indications, either through our own capabilities or by entering into agreements with others, or to maintain such capabilities in countries where we have already commenced commercial sales, we will not be able to successfully sell Soliris.  In that event, we will not be able to generate significant revenues.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish and maintain our own capabilities or enter into and maintain any marketing or distribution agreements with third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all.  Even if we hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need to support our objectives, or enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties on acceptable terms, we may not do so in an efficient manner or on a timely basis.  We may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution capabilities necessary to successfully market and sell Soliris. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming.  Our expenses associated with building up and maintaining the sales force and distribution capabilities around the world may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of Soliris.  We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in commercializing Soliris.

If we market Soliris in a manner that violates health care fraud and abuse laws and other laws regulating marketing and promotion, we may be subject to investigations and civil or criminal penalties.

In addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care “fraud and abuse” laws, such as the Federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations.  Federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally or state financed health care programs.  This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. We seek to comply with the anti-kickback laws and with the available statutory exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible.  However, our practices may not in all cases fit within the safe harbors, and our practices may therefore be subject to case-by-case scrutiny.

The Federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.  Pharmaceutical companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the Federal government under this Act for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free


product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products; reporting inflated prices to private publications that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, or "off-label" uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Federal programs for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.

Although physicians are permitted to, based on their medical judgment, prescribe products for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses.  In the United States, we market Soliris for PNH and aHUS and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of Soliris for PNH and aHUS.  Although we believe our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute off-label promotion of Soliris, the FDA may disagree.  If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute off-label promotion of Soliris, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.  Even if it is later determined we are not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.  Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would also harm our financial condition.  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors and because government scrutiny in this area is high, it is possible that some of our business activities could come under that scrutiny.

In recent years, several states and localities, including California, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities.  Similar legislation is being considered in other states.  Additionally, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal government has enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions, which when implemented will require manufacturers to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals.  Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear.  Nonetheless, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity.

Similar strict restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drug products in the European Union and other countries. Laws in the European Union, including in the individual European Union member states, require promotional materials and advertising for drug products to comply with the product's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), which is approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a drug product which does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of drug products is prohibited in the European Union. Laws in the European Union, including in the individual European Union member states, also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only drug products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of drug products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.

Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians' codes of professional conduct in the individual European Union member states. The provision of any inducements to physicians to prescribe, recommend, endorse, order, purchase, supply, use or administer a drug product is prohibited. A number of European Union member states have introduced additional rules requiring pharmaceutical companies to publicly disclose their interactions with physicians and to obtain approval from employers, professional organizations and/or competent authorities before entering into agreements with physicians. Violations of these rules could lead to the imposition of fines or imprisonment.

Laws, including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions, industry regulations and professional codes of conduct are often strictly enforced. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of the promotional activities of pharmaceutical companies has been observed in a number of European Union member states. We are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our financial relationships with government officials. Worldwide regulators are increasing their regulatory and enforcement


efforts in this area. For example, the Bribery Act in the United Kingdom entered into force in July 2011 applies to any company incorporated in or "carrying on business" in the United Kingdom, regardless of the country in which the alleged bribery activity occurs  and even if the inappropriate activity is undertaken by our international distribution partners.

Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates

None of our product candidates except for Soliris has received regulatory approvals. Soliris has not been approved for any indication other than for the treatment of patients with PNH and aHUS. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, including asfotase alfa and Soliris for other indications, our business may be adversely affected.

All of our product candidates except Soliris are in early stages of development, and we do not expect our other product candidates to be commercially available for several years, if at all.  Similarly, Soliris has not been approved for any indication other than for the treatment of patients with PNH in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories, and for patients with aHUS in the United States and the European Union.  We do not know when or if our product candidates, including asfotase alfa and Soliris for other indications, will be approved.  Our product candidates are subject to strict regulation by regulatory authorities in the United States, in the European Union and in other territories.  We cannot market any product candidate until we have completed all necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals.  We do not know whether regulatory agencies will grant approval for any of our product candidates.  Even if we complete preclinical studies and clinical trials successfully, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals or we may not receive approvals to make claims about our products that we believe to be necessary to effectively market our products.  Data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and failure to comply with regulatory requirements or inadequate manufacturing processes are examples of other problems that could prevent approval.  In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections due to additional government regulation from future legislation, administrative action or changes in the FDA policy.  Even if the FDA approves a product, the approval will be limited to those indications covered in the approval.

Outside the United States, our ability to market any of our potential products is dependent upon receiving marketing approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities.  These foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above.  If we are unable to receive regulatory approvals, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates, and our business may be adversely affected.

Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development.

Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional studies or trials for our product candidates, including asfotase alfa, that if further studies or trials are initiated what the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed, or that if these further studies or trials are completed, that the design or results will provide a sufficient basis to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to commercialize products.  Results of clinical trials could be inconclusive, requiring additional or repeat trials.  If the design or results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to regulatory approval of our product candidates, including asfotase alfa, our company could be materially adversely affected.  Failure of a clinical trial to achieve its pre-specified primary endpoint generally increases the likelihood that additional studies or trials will be required if we determine to continue development of the product candidate, reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate, and may decrease the chances for successfully achieving the primary endpoint in scientifically similar indications.

There are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated.

For human trials, patients must be recruited and each product candidate must be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical indication.  In addition, to ensure safety and effectiveness, the effect of drugs often must be studied over a long period of time, especially for the chronic diseases that we are studying.  Many of our programs focus on diseases with small patient populations and insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program.  We may decide to abandon development of a product candidate, including asfotase alfa, at any time due to unfavorable results or other reasons, or we may have to spend considerable resources repeating clinical trials or conducting additional trials, either of which would increase costs and delay any revenue from those product candidates, if any.

Additional factors that can cause delay, impairment or termination of our clinical trials or our product development efforts include:

•

delay or failure in obtaining institutional review board (IRB), approval or the approval of other reviewing entities to conduct a clinical trial at each site;


•

delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations(CROs), and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;

•

withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;

•

clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;

•

slow patient enrollment, including, for example, due to the rarity of the disease being studied;

•

delay or failure in having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;

•

long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness;

•

lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;

•

disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites;

•

adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients, and the threat of legal claims and litigation alleging injuries;

•

failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials;

•

insufficient clinical trial data to support effectiveness of the product candidates;

•

lack of effectiveness or safety of the product candidate being tested;

•

lack of sufficient funds;

•

inability to meet required specifications or to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner;

•

decisions by regulatory authorities, the IRB, ethics committee, or us, or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;

•

failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the approvals for the facilities in which such product candidate is manufactured; and

•

decisions by competent authorities, IRBs or ethics committees to demand variations in protocols or conduct of clinical trials.

The regulatory approval process is costly and lengthy and we may not be able to successfully obtain all required regulatory approvals.

The preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals are all subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities and agencies in the United States, the European Union and other territories.  We must obtain regulatory approval for each of our product candidates, including asfotase alfa, before marketing or selling any of them.  It is not possible to predict how long the approval processes of the FDA or any other applicable federal or foreign regulatory authority or agency for any of our product candidates will take or whether any such approvals ultimately will be granted.  The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, and positive results in preclinical testing or early phases of clinical studies offer no assurance of success in later phases of the approval process.  The approval process varies from country to country and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.  Generally, preclinical and clinical testing of product candidates can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  If we encounter significant delays in the regulatory process that result in excessive costs, this may prevent us from continuing to develop our product candidates, including asfotase alfa.  Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to generate product revenue.  The risks associated with the approval process include:

•

failure of our product candidates to meet a regulatory agency's requirements for safety, efficacy and quality;

•

disagreement over interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;

•

restricted distribution or limitation on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed;

•

unforeseen safety issues or side effects and potential requirements to establish REMS;


•

disapproval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and

•

governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines.

Even if asfotase alfa and our other product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and health care payers.

Physicians may elect not to recommend our drugs even if they receive marketing approval for a variety of reasons, including the timing of the market introduction of competitive drugs; lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs; perceived lack of cost-effectiveness; lack of availability of reimbursement from third-party payers; convenience and ease of administration; prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and ineffective marketing and distribution support.  Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and similar programs in other countries, and other third-party payers.  These health insurance programs may restrict coverage of some products by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co-payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and by using utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment.  Payers may especially impose these obstacles to coverage for higher-priced drugs, and consequently our drug candidates may be subject to payer-driven restrictions.  In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, European Union member states may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use.  A European Union member state may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.  The reimbursement or budget identified by a government or non-government payer for Soliris in a new indication, if obtained, may be adversely affected by the reimbursement or budget for Soliris in previously approved indications and/or adversely affect the reimbursement or budget for Soliris in such previously approved indication by that payer.

Inability to contract with third party manufacturers and other third party providers on commercially reasonable terms, or failure or delay by us or our third party manufacturers or other third party providers to provide services with respect to our drug products, including asfotase alfa if approved, in the volumes and quality required, would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Clinical quantities of eculizumab are manufactured by us at ARIMF and by Lonza.  Clinical quantities of our other product candidates are manufactured by us at ARIMF or by a third party.  We also depend on a very limited number of third party providers for other services with respect to our clinical and commercial requirements, including product finishing, packaging, vialing and labeling.  We have changed or added third party vialers in the past in order to support uninterrupted supply, and may do so in the future.  No guarantee can be made that regulators will approve additional third party vialers in a timely manner or at all, or that any third party vialer will be able to perform such services for sufficient product volumes for any country or territory.  Manufacture of our drug products, including asfotase alfa, is highly technical, and only a small number of companies have the ability and capacity to manufacture our drug products for our development and commercialization needs.  Due to the highly technical requirements of manufacturing our drug products and the strict quality and control specifications, we and our third party providers may be unable to manufacture or supply our drug products despite our and their efforts. In addition, we cannot be certain that any third party will be able or willing to honor the terms of its agreement, including any obligations to manufacture the drug products in accordance with regulatory requirements and to our quality specifications and volume requirements.  Further, we have limited experience manufacturing the drug candidates that we acquired from Enobia, Taligen Therapeutics, Inc. (Taligen) and Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Orphatec), such as asfotase alfa, ALXN1102 and cPMP.  We cannot guarantee that we or any third party provider will be able to manufacture or supply such drug candidates, or that we or a third party provider will be able to manufacture or supply sufficient quantities to satisfy our requirements.

Manufacture of drug products, including the need to develop and utilize manufacturing processes that consistently produce our drug products to their required quality specifications, is highly regulated by the FDA, EMA and other domestic and foreign authorities.  Regulatory authorities must approve the facilities in which our products are manufactured vialed, packaged and labeled prior to granting marketing approval for any product candidate.  Such facilities are also subject to ongoing inspections, and minor changes in manufacturing or other related processes may require additional regulatory approvals.  We cannot assure you that we or our third party providers will successfully comply with all requirements and regulations, which failure could have a material adverse effect on our business.


We currently have limited experience in manufacturing drug products in volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. We acquired ARIMF in July 2006.  The EC, the FDA and MHLW have approved the use of ARIMF for the production of Soliris, and we are authorized to sell Soliris manufactured in ARIMF in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other territories.  We are entirely dependent on  only one third party provider for commercial vialing in certain territories, including Japan.  We have limited experience in developing commercial-scale manufacturing.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to manufacture our drug products at ARIMF under conditions required by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies on a timely basis, if at all.  ARIMF is subject to approval by other national and regional regulatory agencies before we can begin sales of Soliris or other drug products manufactured in this facility in the applicable countries or regions, and we will continue to be subject to ongoing regulatory inspections thereafter.

We, and our third party providers, may experience higher failure rates than in the past if and when we attempt to increase production volume.  If we experience interruptions in the manufacture or supply of our products, our drug development and commercialization efforts will be delayed.  If any of our outside third party providers stops manufacturing or supplying our products or reduces the amount manufactured or supplied, or is otherwise unable to provide our required amounts at our required quality, we may need to find other alternatives, which is likely to be expensive and time consuming, and also may result in reduced revenue during this period.  Even if we are able to find alternatives they may ultimately be insufficient for our needs.  As a result, our ability to conduct testing and drug trials and our plans for commercialization could be materially adversely affected.  Submission of products and new development programs for regulatory approval, as well as our plans for commercialization, would be delayed or suspended.  Our competitive position and our prospects for achieving or maintaining profitability could be materially and adversely affected.

Due to the nature of the current market for third-party commercial manufacturing, many arrangements require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity for which it contracted.  Penalty payments under these agreements typically decrease over the life of the agreement, and may be substantial initially and de minimis or non-existent in the final period.  The payment of a substantial penalty could harm our financial condition.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

If we cannot obtain new patents, maintain our existing patents and protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, our business and competitive position will be harmed.

In order to protect our drugs and technology more effectively, we need to obtain and maintain patents covering the drugs and technologies we develop.  We have and may in the future obtain patents or the right to practice patents through ownership or license.  Our patent applications may not result in the issue of patents in the United States or other countries. Our patents may not afford adequate protection for our products. Third parties may challenge our patents.  If any of our patents are narrowed, invalidated or become unenforceable, competitors may develop and market products similar to ours that do not conflict with or infringe our patents rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  We may also finance and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational or research institutions.  Such research partners may be unwilling to grant us exclusive rights to technology or products developed through such collaborations.  There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties.  Soliris and our drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming to test and develop. Even if we obtain and maintain patents, our business may be significantly harmed if the patents are not broad enough to protect our drugs from copycat products.

In addition, our business requires using sensitive technology, techniques and proprietary compounds that we protect as trade secrets.  However, we may also rely heavily on collaboration with, or discuss the potential for collaboration with, suppliers, outside scientists and other drug companies.  Collaboration and discussion of potential collaboration present a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets.  If our trade secrets were exposed, it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business prospects.

If we are found to be infringing on patents owned by others, we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and/or obtain a license to continue the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs. If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs, including Soliris, which would adversely affect our business.

Parts of our technology, techniques and proprietary compounds and potential drug candidates, including those which are or may be in-licensed, may be found to infringe patents owned by or granted to others.  On January 26, 2011, Novartis filed a civil action against us and other biopharmaceuticals companies claiming willful infringement by us of its patent.  If it is finally determined that we infringe the Novartis patent, we may be required to pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Soliris regarding certain manufacturing technology.  Although we do not believe that the manufacture of Soliris infringes a valid patent claim


owned by Novartis, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in defending against such action.  In addition to Novartis, other third parties may claim that the manufacture, use or sale of Soliris or other drugs under development infringes patents owned or granted to such third parties.  We are aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the manufacture, use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, and recombinant human single chain antibodies.  Soliris and many of our product candidates are genetically engineered antibodies, including recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, or recombinant human single chain antibodies. In addition to the actions described above, we have received and may receive notices from the owners of some of these broad patents claiming that their patents may be infringed by the development, manufacture or sale of Soliris or some of our drug candidates.  We are also aware of other patents owned by third parties that might be claimed by such third parties to be infringed by the development and commercialization of Soliris and some of our drug candidates.  In respect to some of these patents, we have obtained licenses, or expect to obtain licenses.  However, with regard to such other patents, we have determined in our judgment that:

•

Soliris and our product candidates do not infringe the patents;

•

the patents are not valid; or

•

we have identified and tested or are testing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents and which should permit commercialization of our product candidates.

Any holder of these patents or other patents covering similar technology could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling or developing our drugs.  Legal disputes can be costly and time consuming to defend.  If we cannot successfully defend against any future actions or conflicts, if they arise, we may incur substantial legal costs and may be liable for damages, be required to obtain costly licenses or need to stop manufacturing, using or selling Soliris, which would adversely affect our business.  We may seek to obtain a license prior to or during legal actions in order to reduce further costs and the risk of a court determination that our product infringes the third party's patents.  A required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.  A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

There can be no assurance that we would prevail in a patent infringement action or that we would be able to obtain a license to any third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms or any terms at all; successfully develop non-infringing alternatives on a timely basis; or license alternative non-infringing technology, if any exists, on commercially reasonable terms.  Any impediment to our ability to manufacture, use or sell approved forms of Soliris or our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.

Risks Related to Our Operations

We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals, including our ability to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future

.

Until the quarter ended June 30, 2008, we had never been profitable since we were incorporated in January 1992.  We have maintained profitability on a quarterly basis since the quarter ended June 30, 2008 and on an annual basis beginning with the year ended December 31, 2008.  We believe that we formulate our annual operating budgets with reasonable assumptions and targets, however we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient revenues or control expenses to achieve our financial goals, including continued profitability.  Even if we do achieve profitability in any subsequent quarters, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.  You should not consider our revenue growth in recent periods as indicative of our future performance.  Our revenue in future periods could decline.  We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends or our business may be subject to factors beyond our control, which could harm our operations.  Since we began our business, we have focused on research and development of product candidates.  We launched Soliris for sale for the treatment of patients with PNH in the United States and Europe during 2007.  We obtained marketing approval from the FDA and the EC for Soliris for the treatment of patients with aHUS in September and November 2011, respectively, and have not obtained marketing approval for aHUS in any other country or territory.  We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in marketing and selling Soliris on a continued basis in countries or regions where we have obtained marketing approval, including the United States, Europe and Japan, and we do not know when we will have Soliris available for sale in territories where we have applied or will apply for marketing approval, if ever. We incurred significant debt to finance the acquisition of Enobia and we will have substantial expenses as we continue our research and development efforts, continue to conduct clinical trials and continue to develop manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in the United States and abroad.  The achievement of our financial goals, including the extent of our future profitability, depends on many factors, including our ability to successfully market Soliris in the United States, the European Union and Japan and other territories, our ability to obtain regulatory, pricing, coverage, and reimbursement approvals of Soliris in additional countries and regions and for aHUS and other indications, our ability to successfully market Soliris in additional countries and regions, our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates and our ability to successfully bring our other product candidates, including product candidates we acquired from Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec, to the major commercial


markets throughout the world.

If our competitors get to the marketplace before we do, or with better or less expensive drugs, it may not be profitable to continue to produce Soliris and our product candidates.

The FDA, EC and the MHLW granted orphan drug designation for Soliris in the treatment of PNH and the FDA and EC granted orphan drug designation for aHUS.  Orphan drug status which entitles Soliris to market exclusivity for a total of seven years in the United States and for ten years in the European Union and Japan.  However, if a competitive product that is the same as or similar to Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, is shown to be clinically superior to Soliris in the treatment of PNH or aHUS, or if a competitive product is different from Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, the orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained may not block the approval of such competitive product.  Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies throughout the world have programs to develop complement inhibitor therapies or have publicly announced their intentions to develop drugs which target the inflammatory effects of complement in the immune system.  These and other companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, may develop, manufacture, and market better or cheaper drugs than Soliris or our product candidates.  They may establish themselves in the marketplace before us for Soliris for other indications or for any of our other product candidates.  Other pharmaceutical companies also compete with us to attract academic research institutions as drug development partners, including for licensing these institutions' proprietary technology. If our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions, we will be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent opportunities elsewhere.

If we fail to satisfy our debt service obligations or obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue the commercialization of Soliris or continue or complete our product development.

In February 2012, we acquired Enobia and made an upfront payment of

$623,876

.  We used a substantial portion of our cash on hand and incurred

$320,000

of debt under the terms of a senior secured credit facility to finance the acquisition.  In addition, the definitive agreements for the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions include contingent payments totaling

$470,000

,

$367,000

and

$42,000

, respectively, if and when certain development and commercial milestones are achieved.  In May 2012, Alexion issued

5,000

shares of its common stock in a public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately

$462,000

. We believe that revenues and collections from sales of Soliris along with our existing cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient capital to satisfy our debt service obligations and the contingent consideration required by the acquisitions, and to fund our operations and product development for at least 12 months. We may need to raise additional capital before or after that time to complete or continue the development or commercialization of our products and product candidates or for other purposes.  We are currently selling or preparing for the commercialization of Soliris in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and several other territories, evaluating and preparing regulatory submissions for Soliris in several countries, and conducting, preparing or evaluating several clinical trials.  Funding needs may shift between projects and potentially accelerate and increase as we continue launch and commercialization activities throughout the world and as we initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates.

Additional financing could take the form of public or private debt or equity offerings, equity line facilities, bank loans, including additional borrowing under our existing credit facility, collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners and/or the sale or licensing of some of our property.  The amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including:

•

the cost necessary to sell, market and distribute Soliris;

•

the rate of new patient sales and drug utilization by treated patients;

•

the time and cost necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Soliris in multiple countries;

•

the ability to obtain and maintain reimbursement approvals and funding for Soliris and the time necessary to obtain such approvals and funding;

•

the time and cost necessary to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities outside the United States;

•

the time and cost necessary to purchase or to further develop manufacturing processes, arrange for contract manufacturing or build manufacturing facilities and obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for those facilities;

•

changes in applicable governmental regulatory policies or requests by regulatory agencies for additional information or data;

•

the progress, timing and scope of our research and development programs;

•

the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;


•

the integration of the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec businesses;

•

any new collaborative, licensing or other commercial relationships that we may establish; and

•

the cost of any acquisition.

We may not receive additional funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms.  Financial markets in the United States, Europe and the rest of the world have been experiencing significant volatility in security prices, substantially diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to access additional credit or the equity markets in order to finance our operations, grow our operations in any territory, or expand development programs for our product candidates, or that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in economies.  If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back or eliminate our research and development activities or future operations.  We might have to license our technology to others or relinquish commercialization rights.  This could result in sharing revenues that we might otherwise retain for ourselves.  Any of these actions would harm our business.

If we fail to recruit and retain personnel, we may not be able to implement our business strategy.

We are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and scientific personnel, particularly Dr. Leonard Bell, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, and Dr. Stephen P. Squinto, Ph.D., our Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development.  There is intense competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for qualified scientific and technical personnel.  Since our business is science-oriented and specialized, we need to continue to attract and retain such people.  We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business.  We have employment agreements with Dr. Bell and Dr. Squinto.  None of our key personnel is nearing retirement age or to our knowledge, planning to retire.  To our knowledge, there is no tension between any of our key personnel and the Board of Directors.  If we are unable to retain and recruit highly qualified personnel, our ability to execute our business plan will be materially and adversely affected.

In particular, we highly value the services of Dr. Bell, our Chief Executive Officer.  The loss of his services could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our objectives.

We are significantly leveraged.

In February 2012 we and our wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Sàrl, entered into the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks.  The Credit Agreement provides for a

$240,000

senior secured term loan facility and a

$200,000

senior secured revolving credit facility, which includes up to a

$60,000

sublimit for letters of credit and a

$10,000

sublimit for swingline loans.  Our obligations under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and are required to be guaranteed by certain of our future domestic subsidiaries.  The obligations of Alexion Pharma International Sàrl under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us, certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries, and certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and are required to be guaranteed by certain of our future subsidiaries.  All obligations of each borrower under the credit facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of each borrower's assets and the assets of certain guarantors, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries and real estate located in Smithfield, Rhode Island, but excluding intellectual property and assets of certain foreign subsidiaries.  We may elect that the loans under the credit facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus

1.25%

to

2.00%

depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement), or (ii) in the case of borrowings in U.S. dollars, a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect, (B) Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus

0.50%

, and (C) Eurodollar Rate then in effect plus

1.00%

, plus in each case of (A), (B) or (C),

0.25%

to

1.00%

depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement).

The credit facilities, and the contingent consideration payable in connection with our acquisitions remain outstanding or available, and the degree to which we are leveraged could, among other things:

•

make it difficult for us to make payments on the credit facilities;

•

make it difficult for us to obtain financing for additional acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities or other purposes on favorable terms, if at all;

•

make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures; and

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business.

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.


We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including our manufacturing operations at ARIMF, the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, such as medical and biological wastes, and emissions and discharges into the environment, such as air, soils and water sources.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities.  We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating its property or locations to which wastes were sent from its facilities, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or necessarily caused, the contamination.  Such obligations and liabilities, which to date have not been material, could have a material impact on our business and financial condition.

We may expand our business through acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.

Our business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities.  In 2011, we acquired Taligen and certain assets of Orphatec.  In February 2012 we acquired Enobia.  We may seek additional acquisitions or in-licensing of businesses or products to expand our products and capabilities.  Acquisitions of new businesses or products, including the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions, and in-licensing of new products may involve numerous risks, including:

•

substantial cash expenditures;

•

potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities;

•

incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition;

•

difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies;

•

diverting our management's attention away from other business concerns;

•

risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;

•

the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies; and

•

failure of any acquired businesses or products or in-licensed products to achieve the scientific, medical, commercial or other results anticipated.

We have limited experience in the acquisition and integration of other companies.  We cannot assure you that the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions, or any other acquisition or in-licensing of new products, will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us.  We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business, such as Enobia, Taligen or Orphatec, or an acquired or in-licensed product.  In addition, the future success of such transactions would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with any such acquisitions or in-licensing.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of Enobia, Taligen or Orphatec, or any other acquired businesses or companies work or be successful.

We compete with pharmaceutical companies that have significantly greater resources than we for many of the same acquisition and in-licensing opportunities.  Such pharmaceutical companies may be less leveraged and have better access to capital resources that may preclude us from completing any acquisition or in-licensing.  For this and other reasons, we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.  Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business, any acquired business or any acquired or in-licensed products may require a substantial capital investment by us.  We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  We may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders' ownership interest in our company, or securities convertible into our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders' ownership interest in our company upon conversion.

Our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is a change in ownership of Alexion, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.

As of

December 31, 2012

, we had

$453,617

of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOL's), available to reduce taxable income in future years.  Included in our U.S. federal net operating losses is

$10,337

associated with the acquisition of Enobia.  A portion of these NOL's are currently subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (section 382).  We believe it is more likely than not that we will use the majority of net operating losses.  However, the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income.  The net operating loss carryforwards may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income.


Our ability to utilize the NOL's may be further limited if we undergo an ownership change, as defined in section 382.  This ownership change could be triggered by substantial changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock, which are generally outside of our control.  An ownership change would exist if the stockholders, or group of stockholders, who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the value of our stock, or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under section 382 and the regulations promulgated there under, increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of our stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change.  In the event of an ownership change, section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change NOL's.  The limitation imposed by section 382 for any post-change year would be determined by multiplying the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate.  Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built-in gains which may be present with respect to assets held by us at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five-year period after the ownership change.  Our use of NOL's arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

As a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities.  Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements.  If the Internal Revenue Service, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions we take, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, the United States government and other governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our sales and operations are subject to the economic, political, legal and business conditions in the countries in which we do business, and our failure to operate successfully or adapt to changes in these conditions could cause our sales and operations to be limited or disrupted.

Since 2007, we have significantly expanded our operations and expect to continue to do so in the future.  Our operations in foreign countries subject us to the following additional risks:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

political or economic determinations that adversely impact pricing or reimbursement policies;

•

economic problems or political instability that disrupt health care payment systems;

•

difficulties or inability to obtain financing in markets;

•

unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;

•

difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;

•

changes in laws, regulations or enforcement practices with respect to our business, including without limitation laws relating to reimbursement, competition, pricing and sales and marketing of our products;

•

trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities;

•

compliance with tax, employment and labor laws;

•

costs and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified managers and employees to manage and operate the business in local jurisdictions;

•

costs and difficulties in managing and monitoring international operations; and

•

longer payment cycles.

Our business and marketing methods are also subject to regulation by the governments of the countries in which we operate. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other countries prohibit companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  We have policies and procedures designed to help ensure that we and our representatives, including our employees, comply with such laws, however we cannot guarantee that these policies and procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws for actions taken by our representatives.  Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in


which we operate could materially harm our business.

We conduct, or anticipate that we will conduct, a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of our business.  The exposures result from portions of our revenues, as well as the related receivables, and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen and  Swiss Franc.  We manage our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of up to 36 months, to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The purpose of the hedges of intercompany revenue is to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues.  Further, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of approximately 30 days, designed to limit the balance sheet exposure of monetary assets and liabilities. We enter into these hedges to reduce the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on our operating results.  Gains and losses on these hedge transactions are designed to offset gains and losses on underlying balance sheet exposures.  While we attempt to hedge certain currency risks, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business have, in the past, caused foreign currency transaction gains and losses and have also impacted the amounts of revenues and expenses calculated in U.S. dollars and will likely do so in the future.  Likewise, past currency fluctuations have at times resulted in foreign currency transaction gains, and there can be no assurance that these gains can be reproduced.  See also Footnote 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The credit and financial market conditions may aggravate certain risks affecting our business.

Sales of Soliris are dependent, in large part, on reimbursement from government health administration organizations and private and governmental third-party payers, and also co-payments from individual patients in certain situations.  As a result of adverse credit and financial market conditions, and the overall financial climate, these governmental organizations and payers, and/or individuals, may reduce or delay initiation of treatment, may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations, may delay payment or may seek to reduce reimbursement for Soliris in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  For example, in July 2011, we received non-interest bearing bonds issued by the Greek government that mature in 2012 and 2013 for payment on receivables from 2008 and 2009 as part of the Greek government's plan repayment of its debt to international pharmaceutical companies.  We sold the associated bonds in July 2011 and recorded expense of approximately $4,100 through December 31, 2011 related to the reduction of value of the Greek bonds and other delays impacting the book value of our accounts receivable in other countries.  Soliris is approved for the treatment of patients with PNH and aHUS in the United States and the European Union and for the treatment of PNH in several other territories.  If Soliris is approved in additional territories for PNH, aHUS, or for additional indications that are under clinical development, the reimbursement risks and uncertainties associated with adverse credit and financial market conditions may be exacerbated due to increases in the number of patients receiving Soliris that require reimbursement.  Payment defaults by a government payer could require us to expense previously recorded revenue as uncollectible, and might cause us to end or restrict sales to patients in that country.  Further, the risk of payment default by a government payer could require us to revise our revenue recognition policies in regard to that payer, causing revenue to be recorded only on a cash basis, and we may be required to end or restrict sales to patients in that country.

We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies, associated impacts on the financial markets and our business, and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.  The credit and economic conditions in Greece, Italy and Spain, among other members of the European Union deteriorated in 2011 and 2012.  These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries.  We have recorded an allowance related to all or a portion of receivables in each of Greece, Italy and Spain that have been outstanding for greater than one year as of

December 31, 2012

.

We may not be able to successfully mitigate or prevent our exposures to volatile economic and financial conditions and our failure to operate successfully or adapt to changes in these conditions could cause our sales and operations to be limited or disrupted or otherwise harm our business.

Additionally, we rely upon third-parties for certain parts of our business, including Lonza, licensees, wholesale distributors of Soliris, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and other third-party suppliers and financial institutions.  Because of the volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.


Government initiatives that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products could adversely affect our business.

Governments in countries where we operate have adopted or have shown significant interest in pursuing legislative initiatives to reduce costs of health care.  Any such government-adopted health care measures could adversely impact the pricing of Soliris or the amount of coverage and reimbursement available for Soliris from governmental agencies or other third-party payers.  For example, in March 2010, the President signed the PPACA, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry.  PPACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict.  Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under health insurance exchanges, and fraud and abuse enforcement.   While the constitutionality of key provisions of PPACA have been upheld by the Supreme Court, legislative changes remain possible.  In addition, our industry may be affected by broader legislation addressing federal spending, including, for example, a sequester that is scheduled to take effect in March 2013 and cuts to most Medicare spending by 2%.  As another example, the governments of Germany and Spain each approved increases to mandatory rebates on the sales of pharmaceutical products.  Further in January 2013, Alexion was informed by the Advisory Group for National Specialised Services (AGNSS) within the U.K. National Health Service that although Soliris would help save lives and improve the quality of life for children and adults with aHUS, the U.K. Health Ministers decided not to recommend national commissioning of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS at this stage. Rather, Soliris will be referred to NICE for further review as part of its new Highly Specialised Technologies programme.

We expect that the implementation of current laws and policies, the amendment of those laws and policies in the future, as well as the adoption of new laws and policies, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase our product sales or successfully commercialize our product candidates, or could limit or eliminate our future spending on development projects.  In many cases, these government initiatives, even if enacted into law, are subject to future rulemaking by regulatory agencies.  Although we have evaluated these government initiatives and the impact on our business, we cannot know with certainty whether any such law, rule or regulation will adversely affect coverage and reimbursement of Soliris, or to what extent, until such laws, rules and regulations are promulgated, implemented and enforced.  The announcement or adoption of regulatory or legislative proposals could delay or prevent our entry into new markets, affect our reimbursement or sales in the markets where we are already selling Soliris and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, customers and business partners, and personally identifiable information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business.

Natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, shipping embargoes, labor unrest or political instability, could adversely affect our operations, including our ability to supply and commercialize Soliris.

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and the effects of these natural disasters, as well as acts of war or terrorism, shipping embargoes, labor unrest or political instability could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers.  Such events could adversely impact our facilities, or interfere with the manufacture or distribution of Soliris and our product candidates.


Risks Related to Our Common Stock

If the trading price of our common stock continues to fluctuate in a wide range, our stockholders will suffer considerable uncertainty with respect to an investment in our common stock.

The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors such as announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors' operating results or clinical or scientific results, fluctuations in the trading prices or business prospects of our competitors and collaborators, changes in our prospects, particularly with respect to sales of Soliris, and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our common stock.  In particular, the trading price of the common stock of many biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected.  This is due to several factors, including general market conditions, sales of Soliris, the announcement of the results of our clinical trials or product development and the results of our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for our products.  While we cannot predict our future performance, if our stock price continues to fluctuate in a wide range, an investment in our common stock may result in considerable uncertainty for an investor.

Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and our stockholders' rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management.

Because we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Laws, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control that might be beneficial to us or our stockholders.  Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary, or a majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the written request of stockholders who together own of record 50% of the outstanding stock of all classes entitled to vote at such meeting.  Our bylaws also specify that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors.  Our charter does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors, which may have enabled a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to elect one or more directors.  Under our charter, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to designate up to 5,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series.  The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.

Pursuant to our stockholder rights plan, each share of common stock has an associated preferred stock purchase right.  The rights will not trade separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding common stock.  The rights are designed to make it more likely that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to guard against the use of partial tender offers or other coercive tactics to gain control of us.  These provisions could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices.  These provisions could also limit the ability of stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that stockholders may deem to be in their best interests and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.

Item 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

None.


Item 2.

PROPERTIES.

We conduct our primary operations at the owned and leased facilities described below.

We believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our on-going activities. In addition to the locations above, we also lease space in other U.S. states and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization.

In November 2012, we entered into a new lease agreement for approximately 283,000 square feet of office and laboratory space to be constructed in New Haven, Connecticut.  The construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2013 and be completed in 2015.  Upon completion of the new facility, we will relocate our headquarters and Cheshire operations to New Haven.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders through the innovation, development and commercialization of life-transforming therapeutic products. Our marketed product Soliris is the first and only therapeutic approved for patients with two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system:  PNH, a life-threatening and ultra-rare blood disorder, and aHUS, a life-threatening and ultra-rare genetic disease. We are also evaluating additional potential indications for Soliris in severe and ultra-rare diseases in which chronic uncontrolled complement activation is the underlying mechanism, and we are progressing in various stages of development with additional biotechnology product candidates as treatments for patients with


severe and ultra-rare disorders.  We were incorporated in 1992 and began commercial sale of Soliris in 2007.

Soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, transplant rejection and neurology. Soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that effectively blocks terminal complement activity at the doses currently prescribed. The initial indication for which we received approval for Soliris is PNH. PNH is an ultra-rare, debilitating and life-threatening, genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by chronic uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells, or hemolysis. The chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life-threatening thromboses, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark-colored urine (hemoglobinuria).

Soliris was approved for the treatment of PNH by the FDA and the EC in 2007 and by MHLW in 2010, and has been approved in several other territories. Additionally, Soliris has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories.

In September 2011, Soliris was approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with aHUS.  aHUS is a genetic ultra-rare disease characterized by chronic uncontrolled complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy, the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, causing a reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and life-threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart and other vital organs.  Also, in November 2011, the EC granted marketing authorization for Soliris to treat pediatric and adult patients with aHUS in Europe.  The FDA and EC granted Soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with aHUS.

On February 7, 2012, we acquired Enobia, a privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition was intended to further our objective to develop and commercialize therapies for patients with severe, ultra-rare and life-threatening disorders. Enobia's lead product candidate, asfotase alfa, is a human recombinant targeted alkaline phosphatase enzyme-replacement therapy for patients suffering with hypophosphatasia (HPP), an ultra-rare, life-threatening, genetic metabolic disease for which there are no approved treatments. We made a cash payment of

$610,000

, subject to purchase price adjustments, for 100% of Enobia's capital stock. Additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of

$470,000

may be due upon reaching various regulatory and sales milestones. We financed the acquisition with a combination of existing cash and proceeds from our new credit facility.

On February 8, 2011, we acquired patents and assets from Orphatec related to an investigational therapy for patients with MoCD Type A, an ultra-rare genetic disorder characterized by severe brain damage and rapid death in newborns.  We made initial payments of

$3,050

in cash and may make additional future payments of up to

$42,000

in contingent milestone payments upon various development, regulatory and commercial milestones.

On January 28, 2011, we acquired Taligen , a privately held development stage biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition was intended to broaden our portfolio of preclinical compounds and to expand our capabilities in translational medicine. We acquired preclinical compounds and novel antibody and protein regulators of the complement inflammatory pathways. We made an upfront cash payment of

$111,773

for 100% of Taligen’s equity interests. Additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of

$367,000

may be due upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones in both the United States and European Union for up to six product candidates.

Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates

The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, “Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:

•

Revenue recognition;

•

Contingent liabilities;

•

Inventories;


•

Research and development expenses;

•

Share-based compensation;

•

Valuation of goodwill, acquired intangible assets and in-process research and development (IPR&D);

•

Valuation of contingent consideration; and

•

Income taxes.

Revenue Recognition

Net Product Sales

Our principal source of revenue is product sales.  We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, and we have no further performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon receipt of the product by the end customer, which is typically a hospital, physician’s office, private or government pharmacy or other health care facility. Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, such as value-added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in our statements of operations and do not impact net product sales.

In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. We also sell Soliris to government agencies. Outside the United States, our customers are primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers and distributors.

Because of factors such as the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from product sale to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights, Soliris customers often carry limited inventory. We also monitor inventory within our sales channels to determine whether deferrals are appropriate based on factors such as inventory levels, contractual terms and financial strength of distributors.

In addition to sales in countries where Soliris is commercially available, we have also recorded revenue on sales for patients receiving Soliris treatment through named-patient programs.  The relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named-patient basis where Soliris has not received final approval for commercial sale.

We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid in the United States and other programs outside the United States, as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made. Generally, the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months.

We have entered into volume-based arrangements with governments in certain countries in which reimbursement is limited to a contractual amount.  Under this type of arrangement, amounts billed in excess of the contractual limitation are repaid to these governments as a rebate. We estimate incremental discounts resulting from these contractual limitations, based on estimated sales during the limited period, and we apply the discount percentage to product shipments as a reduction of revenue. Our calculations related to these arrangements require estimation of sales during the limitation period, and adjustments in these estimates may have a material impact in the period in which these estimates change.


We have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


as follows:

We record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue, unless we receive an identifiable and separate benefit for the consideration, and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received.  If both conditions are met, we record the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense.  These costs are typically known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception. We record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled.

We sell Soliris to a limited number of customers, and we evaluate the creditworthiness of each customer on a regular basis. In certain European countries, sales by us are subject to payment terms that are statutorily determined. This is primarily the case in countries where the payer is government-owned or government-funded, which we consider to be creditworthy. The length of time from sale to receipt of payment in certain countries typically exceeds our credit terms.  In countries in which collections from customers extend beyond normal payment terms, we seek to collect interest. We record interest on customer receivables as interest income when collected.  For non-interest bearing receivables with an estimated payment beyond one year, we discount the accounts receivable to present value at the date of sale, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue.   If creditworthiness declines further, subsequent adjustments for further declines in credit rating are recorded as bad debt expense as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.  We assess on an ongoing basis whether collectibility is reasonably assured at the time of sale and we also use judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables if and when collection becomes doubtful.

We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business.  For additional information related to our concentration of credit risk associated with certain international accounts receivable balances, refer to the

"Liquidity and Capital Resources"

section below.

Contingent liabilities

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our operating results.


Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the weighted-average cost method.

We capitalize inventory produced for commercial sale, including costs incurred prior to regulatory approval but subsequent to the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) when the Company has determined that the inventory has probable future economic benefit.

Products that have been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, such as Soliris, are also used in clinical programs to assess the safety and efficacy of the products for usage in diseases that have not been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.  The form of Soliris utilized for both commercial and clinical programs is identical and, as a result, the inventory has an "alternative future use" as defined in authoritative guidance.  Raw materials and purchased drug product associated with clinical development programs are included in inventory and charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes and, therefore, does not have an "alternative future use".

For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery.  Delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to us.  Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered.  We also recognize expense for raw materials purchased when the raw materials pass quality inspection and we have an obligation to pay for the materials.

We also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at ARIMF in property, plant and equipment prior to the approval of the facility by regulatory authorities.

We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, which would require adjustments to our inventory values. Soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of 48 months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to realize the carrying value of the Soliris inventory.  In the future, reduced demand, quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels, which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales.

The determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management. A critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts. We then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand. To the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold, we will write down the value of inventory. If actual results differ from those estimates, additional inventory write-offs may be required.

Research and Development Expenses

We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations (CRO’s), clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels are monitored through close communication with the CRO’s and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CRO and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. The estimates are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as necessary, and are included in research and development expenses for the related period. For clinical study sites, which are paid periodically on a per-subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter. The estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed.


Share-Based Compensation

We grant equity awards under one share-based compensation plan known as the Amended and Restated Incentive 2004 Plan. Under this plan, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and other stock-related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary.  Stock-related awards are also outstanding under other share-based compensation plans, but we have not granted awards under these plans since 2004.

Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black-Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term until exercise, forfeiture or cancellation, as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures. We currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. If factors change or we employ different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts.

Valuation of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)

We have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and IPR&D related to our acquisitions. When identifiable intangible assets, including IPR&D, are acquired, we determine the fair values of the assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:

•

timing and costs to complete the in-process projects;

•

timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;

•

estimated future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and

•

discount rates.

We may also utilize a cost approach, which estimates the costs that would be incurred to replace the assets being purchased.  Significant inputs into the cost approach include estimated rates of return on historical costs that a market participant would expect to pay for these assets.

Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur.

Intangible assets related to IPR&D are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of IPR&D and begin amortization. Impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment.  In the third quarter 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of

$26,300

to write-down an IPR&D asset to fair value, which was determined to be de minimis.  As of

December 31, 2012

, the carrying value of our IPR&D was not impaired.

If these projects are not successfully developed, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets, including IPR&D, may become impaired if the underlying projects do not progress as we initially estimated. We believe that the assumptions used in developing our estimates of intangible asset values were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisitions. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs, profitability, or the events associated with such projects, such as clinical results, will occur as estimated.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized.  Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. We are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value, as determined by our traded share price, as compared to our book value of net assets. We completed our annual impairment test as of

December 31, 2012

and determined the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired.


Valuation of Contingent Consideration

We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date.  We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:

•

timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;

•

timing and probability of success of meeting commercial milestones, such as sales levels of a specific compound; and

•

discount rates.

Our contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with our acquisitions.  On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood of or timing of achieving any development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.

The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.

Income Taxes

We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.  We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that has been taken or we expect to take on income tax returns if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained.

We follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted.

We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not certain. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. If we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material adjustments to income tax expense in that period.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard on the presentation of comprehensive income.  The new standard eliminated the current alternative to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.  Under the new standard, companies can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive statements.  We adopted the provisions of this standard during the first quarter of 2012.

In July 2012, the FASB issued a new standard which amends the guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill.  The new standard allows companies an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is


more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the fair value of the asset.  Under the new standard, a company is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the company determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not impaired.  The new standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted the provisions of this guidance for our 2012 annual impairment test.  The adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Comparison of the Year Ended

December 31, 2012

to the Year Ended

December 31, 2011

Net Product Sales

Net product sales by significant geographic region are as follows:

The increase in revenue for fiscal year


versus


was primarily due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris globally. The increase in treated patients was due to physicians requesting Soliris therapy for additional patients, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories and reimbursement for aHUS in the United States.  We also recognized

$3,300

related to an agreement reached with a payer in the second quarter of 2012 related to product shipped during


2011.

The increase in revenues was offset by the negative impact of approximately

$16,566

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates (inclusive of hedging activity) versus the U.S. dollar for the year ended

December 31, 2011

. The negative impact was primarily due to the Euro, offset by a positive impact of the Japanese Yen.  We recorded a gain (loss) in revenue of

$12,869

and

$(6,558)

related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, which is included in revenue from outside the United States, for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

Cost of Sales

In October 2012, we entered into a settlement and non-exclusive license agreement with a third party.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of approximately $38,000 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and will pay royalties on sales of Soliris in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result of this settlement and non-exclusive license agreement, we reduced our estimate for probable contingent liabilities and recorded a gain in cost of sales of $53,377 in the third quarter 2012.

Exclusive of the settlement noted above, cost of sales were

$126,214

and

$93,140

, or

11%

and

12%

of product revenue, respectively, for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris.

Research and Development Expense

Our research and development expense includes personnel, facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, as well as product development costs.  We group our research and development expenses into two major categories: external direct expenses and all other R&D expenses.

External direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development, product development and discovery research. Clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates. Product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to manufacturing development, medical affairs and regulatory functions, including manufacturing of material for clinical and research activities. Discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates. Clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs, while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated.

All other R&D expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products, our product development and our discovery research efforts. These costs have not been allocated directly to each program.

The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses:

During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we incurred research and development expenses of

$222,732

,

an increase

of

$85,311

, or

62%

versus the

$137,421

incurred during the year ended

December 31, 2011

. The

increase

was primarily related to the following:

•

Increase

of

$13,294

in external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab


and our asfotase alfa program acquired in February 2012, as well as an increase in costs related to other clinical programs.  See table below.

•

Increase

of

$33,895

in external product development expenses related primarily to the production of clinical amounts of asfotase alfa.

•

Increase

of

$31,541

in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and development programs.

The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, "Business", for a description of each of these programs:

Prior to January 1, 2006, substantially all of our research and development expenses were related to two products, eculizumab and pexelizumab. We obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of PNH in 2007 in the United States and European Union, and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in 2006.

The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. We cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs. We could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated. For additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs, please refer to Item 1A "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2013 due to clinical development and manufacturing costs related to our expanding development programs. For additional information on these programs, please refer to “Product and Development Programs” in Item I "Business" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Our selling, general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel, corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products. These selling, general and administrative costs include: corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation; marketing and sales operations in support of Soliris; human resources; finance, legal, information technology and support personnel expenses; and other corporate costs such as telecommunications, insurance, audit, government affairs and legal expenses.

The table below provides information regarding selling, general and administrative expense:


During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of

$384,678

,

an increase

of

$76,502

, or

25%

, versus the

$308,176

incurred during the year ended

December 31, 2011

. The

increase

was primarily related to the following:

•

Increase

in salary, benefits and other labor expenses of

$38,035

. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $25,400 related to our global commercial staff to support global expansion. This increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of $12,600 within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure growth as a global commercial entity.

•

Increase

in external selling, general and administrative expenses of

$38,467

.  This increase was primarily due to costs associated with marketing and professional services of $18,400, increased distribution costs of $3,000, increased charitable contributions of $4,800, increased occupancy costs of $4,300 due to expansion of current facilities in the United States and Switzerland and new facilities associated with the acquisition of Enobia, and an increase of $7,000 in other administrative costs incurred in connection with our infrastructure growth.

We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase, at a lower rate than our revenue, in 2013, reflecting our continued growth as a commercial organization throughout the world.

Acquisition-related Costs

We incurred the following acquisition-related costs in


and


associated with our acquisitions of Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec:

The following table provides information for acquisition-related costs for each acquisition:

Included in the acquisition-related costs for Taligen for the year ended

December 31, 2012

is a gain of

$4,331

related to the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to this acquisition.  The decrease in fair value was a result of a decreased likelihood of payments for contingent consideration due to the negative scientific findings, decrease in value and related deprioritization of the age-related macular degeneration program.

Impairment of Intangible Asset

During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we reviewed for impairment the value of an early stage, preclinical indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the Taligen acquisition.  We initiated such review based on our evaluation of negative scientific findings associated with our development of a different asset for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, the likelihood of success for ophthalmic use and the value that can be obtained from a market participant in an arm's length transaction. These developments led us to deprioritize the development of this acquired asset.  As a result, in the third quarter 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of

$26,300

to write-down this asset to fair value, which was determined to be de minimis.


Interest and Other Expense

The following table provides information regarding interest and other expense:

We recognize investment income primarily from our portfolio of cash equivalents. During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, investment income

decreased

$73

, or

4%

to

$1,838

.

We incur interest on our term notes, revolving credit facility, and capital lease obligations. During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, interest expense

increased

$6,614

, to

$7,402

due to interest on borrowings under our new credit facility used in the acquisition of Enobia in February 2012.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses relate to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we recognized

$1,208

of foreign currency loss,

a decrease

of

$1,073

, versus a loss of

$2,281

incurred during the year ended

December 31, 2011

. The losses recorded in these periods were a result of the costs of hedging our exposures, as well as the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs.

Income Taxes

During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we recorded an income tax provision of

$142,744

and an effective tax rate of

35.9%

, compared to an income tax provision of

$54,353

and an effective tax rate of

23.7%

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

.

The income tax provision for


is attributable to the U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes on our profitable operations, as well as to the tax expense of

$21,812

associated with the structuring of the Enobia business.  The tax provision for


is principally attributable to the U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in our profitable operations. In September 2011, we completed our assessment of the impact the election to claim federal foreign tax credits and the federal orphan drug credits would have on our historical tax returns.  Based on this assessment, we elected to claim both the foreign tax credit for the tax year ended December 31, 2010 and orphan drug credit for the tax years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.  The net federal income tax benefit recorded during 2011 as a result of the election to claim the federal foreign tax credit for 2010 and the federal orphan drug credit for 2010 and 2009 was approximately

$15,400

.

The Company was granted an incentive tax holiday in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland effective January 1, 2010, with a final expiration date in 2019. The tax holiday will exempt the Company from most local corporate income taxes in Switzerland through the end of 2014 and is expected to be renewed for an additional 5 years. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by

$3,173

in


and

$2,506

in


.

The U.S. Federal tax credit for research and experimentation expenses expired December 31, 2011.  In connection with this expiration, our 2012 tax expense does not include any benefit from the U.S. Federal tax credit for research and experimentation.  In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which retroactively extends the tax credit for research and experimentation back to January 1, 2012 through the end of 2013 was signed into law.  The effects of a change in tax law is recognized in the period that includes the date of enactment and, therefore, our tax benefit attributable to the 2012 U.S. Federal tax credit for research and experimentation will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013.

We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where the realization is not certain.  We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.


Comparison of the Year Ended

December 31, 2011

to the Year Ended

December 31, 2010

Net Product Sales

Revenues by significant geographic region are as follows:

The increases in revenue for fiscal year


versus


were primarily due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris globally.  The increase in treated patients was due to additional patients and physicians requesting Soliris therapy, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories, including approval for PNH in Japan in the third quarter of 2010, Australia in the first quarter of 2011 and in certain provinces in Canada in the third quarter of 2011, and approval for aHUS in the United States in the third quarter of 2011.

The increase in revenues was offset by the negative impact of approximately $815 for the year ended

December 31, 2011

due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates (inclusive of hedging activity) versus the U.S. dollar for the year ended

December 31, 2010

.  The negative impact was primarily due to the Euro and the British Pound, offset by a positive impact of the Japanese Yen.  We recorded a (loss) gain in revenue of

$(6,558)

and

$8,778

related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, which is included in revenue from outside the United States, for the years ended

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales was

$93,140

and

$64,437

, or

12%

of product revenue, for the years ended

December 31, 2011

and


. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris.

Research and Development Expenses

The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses:

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we incurred research and development expenses of

$137,421

, an increase of

$39,027

, or

40%

, versus the

$98,394

incurred during the year ended

December 31, 2010

. The increase was primarily related to the following:

•

Increase of

$6,434

in external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non-PNH indications, including costs for the STEC-HUS trial initiated in the second quarter 2011.


•

Increase of

$12,344

in external product development expenses related primarily to costs associated with our nephrology clinical programs and regulatory affairs for supporting our clinical programs, including aHUS.

•

Increase of

$3,004

in discovery research expenses related primarily to costs associated with our Translation Medicine group initiated from the acquisition of Taligen.

•

Increase of

$16,385

in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and development programs.

The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, "Business", for a description of each of these programs:

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

The table below provides information regarding selling, general and administrative expense:

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of

$308,176

, an increase of

$81,410

, or

36%

, versus the

$226,766

incurred during the year ended

December 31, 2010

. The increase was primarily related to the following:

•

Increase in salaries, benefits and other labor expenses of

$50,483

. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $35,943 related to our global commercial staff to support global expansion and to prepare for the initiation of Soliris as a therapy for aHUS which was granted approval in the United States and Europe in the fourth quarter 2011. This increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of $14,540 within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure growth as a global commercial entity.

•

Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of

$30,927

.  The increase was primarily due to costs associated with marketing and professional services of $26,410, occupancy costs of $4,528 due to expansion of current facilities in the United States and Switzerland and new facilities in Turkey, India and China and, increases of $2,544 due to increased bad debt expense associated with declines in credit ratings on our Greek receivables in quarters subsequent to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.


Other Income and Expense

The following table provides information regarding interest and other income and expense:

We recognize investment income primarily from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities.  During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, investment income

increased

$400

, or

26%

, to

$1,911

due primarily to higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, interest expense

increased

$84

, or

12%

, to

$788

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we recognized

$2,281

of foreign currency loss,

a decrease

of

$153

, versus a loss of

$2,434

incurred during the year ended

December 31, 2010

.  The

decrease

was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs.

Income Taxes

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we recorded an income tax provision of

$54,353

and an effective tax rate of

23.7%

, compared to an income tax provision of

$51,981

and an effective tax rate of

34.9%

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

.  The income tax provision for


and


are principally attributable to the U.S. Federal, state, and foreign income taxes in our profitable operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except per share data)

The following table summarizes the components of our financial condition as of

December 31, 2012

and

December 31, 2011

:

The

increase

in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the net proceeds received from the common stock offering completed in May 2012, proceeds from our new credit facility, net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and cash generated from operations, offset by cash used for the Enobia acquisition, capital expenditures and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.

We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly those related to research and product development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, international expansion, commercialization of products and capital investment. However, we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash and cash equivalents should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future.

Since the commercial launch of Soliris in 2007, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows from operations.  We expect to continue to be able to fund for the foreseeable future, our operations including principal and interest payments on our credit facility and contingent payments from our acquisitions principally through our cash flows from operations.  We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of equity or debt financings or from other sources, if necessary, for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes.


Financial Instruments

Until required for use in the business, we may invest our cash reserves in money market funds or high-quality marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy. The stated objectives of our investment policy is to preserve capital, provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements, maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions.

Financial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents, accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts. At

December 31, 2012

, two individual customers accounted for

18%

and

12%

of the accounts receivable balance. At

December 31, 2011

, the same two customers accounted for

18%

and

13%

of the accounts receivable balance.

We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business.  The credit and economic conditions in Greece, Italy and Spain, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated throughout 2011 and 2012.  These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries.  Substantially all of our accounts receivable due from these countries are due from or backed by sovereign or local governments, and the amount of non-sovereign accounts receivable is not material. Our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in Greece is limited, as we do not have a material amount of accounts receivable in Greece.

As of

December 31, 2012

and


, our total gross accounts receivable in Italy and Spain were approximately

$82,200

and

$77,000

, respectively.  As of

December 31, 2012

and


, approximately

$21,100

and

$21,300

, respectively, of these amounts has been outstanding for greater than one year, and we have recorded an allowance of approximately

$2,000

and

$400

, respectively, related to these gross receivables.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we recorded $21,334 of accounts receivable in Spain within other non-current assets, which approximates the amount of the receivables that we estimate with collection periods beyond one year.  During the year ended

December 31, 2012

and


, we have recorded expense of approximately

$1,100

and

$350

, respectively, related to the expectation of delayed payment from these countries.  Our net accounts receivable from these countries as of

December 31, 2012

and


are summarized as follows:

We manage our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. As of

December 31, 2012

, we have foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling

$964,189

. These outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of

$17,180

, of which an unrealized gain of

$27,240

is included in other assets, offset by an unrealized loss of

$10,060

included in other liabilities. The counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are large multinational commercial banks, and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material.

At

December 31, 2012

, our financial assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value.  We have classified our financial assets and liabilities as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, but substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  Our Level 2 assets consist primarily of money market funds and foreign exchange forward contracts.  Our Level 2 liabilities consist also of foreign exchange forward contracts.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. Our Level 3 liabilities consist of contingent consideration related to acquisitions.

Acquisitions and Contingent Consideration Obligations

In February 2012, we completed a business combination with Enobia.  This acquisition required us to make upfront cash payments of

$623,876

, which we have paid from our available cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from our new credit facility.  In 2012, as a result of structuring the Enobia business, we recorded income tax expense of

$21,812

in our income statement.  The structuring will require us to make a cash payment of approximately $50,000 in early 2013, and this amount is fully accrued on our balance sheet as of

December 31, 2012

.


The purchase agreements for the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions include contingent payments totaling up to

$470,000

,

$367,000

and

$42,000

, respectively, if and when certain development and commercial milestones are achieved.  Of these milestone amounts, $564,000 and $315,000 of the contingent payments relate to development and commercial milestones, respectively.  We do not expect that any significant contingent payments will be made in the next 12 months and, accordingly, we do not expect these amounts to have an impact on our liquidity in the near-term.  As future payments become probable, we will evaluate methods of funding payments, which could be made from available cash, cash generated from operations or proceeds from other financing.

Long-term Debt

In February 2012, we and our wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Sàrl, entered into the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders and other parties named in the Credit Agreement that provides for a

$240,000

senior secured term loan facility payable in equal quarterly installments of

$12,000

starting

June 30, 2012

and a

$200,000

senior secured revolving credit facility, which includes up to a

$60,000

sublimit for letters of credit and a

$10,000

sublimit for swingline loans.  We may also use the facilities for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. Any of Alexion's wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries may borrow funds under the facilities upon satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Credit Agreement.   In connection with the acquisition of Enobia in February 2012, we borrowed

$240,000

under the term loan facility and

$80,000

under the revolving facility and we used our available cash for the remaining purchase price.  During the second quarter ended 2012, we repaid the revolving facility in full.  In addition to the required quarterly installments of $12,000, we also pre-paid

$55,000

of the term loan facility during the third quarter of 2012, and we had

$149,000

outstanding as of

December 31, 2012

.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we had open letters of credit of

$9,695

, and our borrowing availability under the revolving facility was

$190,305

at

December 31, 2012

. We expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet debt service obligations.

Contingent Liabilities

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information, and changes in the estimated amounts and timing of paying these potential liabilities could have a material impact on our liquidity.

The estimates of amounts potentially owed to other third parties may be influenced by the outcome of future litigation or other claims, if any, the results of which are uncertain. An increase in estimated amounts owed or a requirement to pay these amounts on an accelerated basis may result in a material adverse effect on liquidity.  In October 2012, we entered into a settlement and non-exclusive license agreement with a third party.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of approximately $38,000 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and will pay royalties on sales of Soliris in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we recorded accrued expenses of

$25,450

for probable royalties owed to third parties.

Taxes

We do not record U.S. tax expense on the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the businesses offshore.  We do not have any present or anticipated future need for cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, as cash generated in the U.S., as well as borrowings, are expected to be sufficient to meet future U.S. liquidity needs.  At

December 31, 2012

, approximately

$128,000

of our cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries, a significant portion of which is required for liquidity needs of our foreign subsidiaries.  In connection with the acquisition of Enobia, certain of our foreign subsidiaries have bank debt which remains outstanding at

December 31, 2012

.  Due to the liability position of our foreign subsidiaries, these subsidiaries will repay the bank debt, as well as any outstanding intercompany debt, prior to having excess cash available which could be used to repatriate to our entities in the United States.  While our expectation is that all foreign undistributed earnings are permanently invested, there could be certain unforeseen future events that could impact our permanent reinvestment assertion.  Such events include acquisitions, corporate restructurings or tax law changes not currently contemplated.

At

December 31, 2012

, we have pre-tax federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of

$453,617

, and

$97,452

, respectively. These NOL’s expire between 2021 and 2032. We also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of

$80,755

and

$7,513

, respectively. These income tax credits expire between 2014 and 2032. Due to the amount of our NOL’s and credit carryforwards, we do not anticipate paying substantial U.S. federal income taxes within the next twelve months. We expect to pay cash taxes in various U.S. states and in foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net


operating losses.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer's ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50% over a three-year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year. Additionally, in connection with our acquisition of Enobia, we acquired

$10,337

of net operating losses subject to a limitation. However, we believe that such limitations are not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any significant amount of our federal NOL’s.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

In November 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

$400,000

of our common stock.  This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.  We expect that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund any share repurchases.

Cash Flows

The following summarizes our net change in cash and cash equivalents:

The

increase

in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and stock option exercises, offset by cash used for the Enobia acquisition and repurchases of shares of our common stock.

Operating Activities

The components of cash flows from operating activities, as reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are as follows:

•

Our reported net income was

$254,822

and

$175,315

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

•

Non-cash items included depreciation and amortization, impairment of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, deferred taxes, unrealized foreign currency (gain) loss, gains and losses on forward contracts and currency translation adjustments, and were

$177,072

and

$111,952

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

•

Net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was

$21,281

and

$17,183

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.  The

$21,281

change in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to:

•

Increase in accounts receivable of

$72,870

due to the increased number of patients treated with Soliris globally, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories.

•

Increase in inventory of

$6,265

related to increased production of inventory to support commercial growth.

•

Increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of

$17,041

, primarily related to prepaid taxes and prepaid manufacturing costs.

•

Increase of

$61,723

in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily related to increases in accrued income taxes, rebates and compensation, offset by a decrease in accrued royalties.  The decrease in accrued royalties was related to the intellectual property settlement.


•

Increase of

$13,172

in deferred revenue due to increased shipments in advance of recognizing revenue.

In 2013, we expect increases in cash flow from operations which will be highly dependent on sales levels, and the related cash collections, from Soliris.

Investing Activities

The components of cash flows from investing activities consisted of the following:

•

Additions to property, plant and equipment were

$21,846

and

$21,982

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

•

Maturities of marketable securities of

$94,458

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

.

•

Payments of

$605,735

and

$105,886

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively, related to  acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash flows from financing activities reflected proceeds from the exercise of stock options of

$66,438

and

$35,765

for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.  In addition, during


, we recognized proceeds of

$462,212

in connection with the sale of

5,000

shares of our common stock.

In connection with the acquisition of Enobia in February 2012, we borrowed

$240,000

under the term loan facility and

$80,000

under the revolving facility, and we used our available cash for the remaining purchase price.  During the second quarter of 2012, we repaid the revolving facility in full.  In addition, during


, we made payments of

$91,000

against the term loan facility.

During the fourth quarter of


, we repurchased

$11,553

worth of shares of our common stock under a repurchase program that was approved by our Board of Directors in November 2012.


Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at

December 31, 2012

and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non-termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:

The contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and other factors described in Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Note 9 "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax matters of

$12,393

at

December 31, 2012

. The timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at

December 31, 2012

. We do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

We also did not include contingent payments related to the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions, as the timing of payment for these amounts was not reasonably estimable at

December 31, 2012

. Contingent payments associated with  these business combinations total up to

$470,000

for Enobia,

$367,000

for Taligen and

$42,000

for Orphatec.  We do not expect to make any significant contingent payments in the next 12 months.

Credit Facilities

On February 7, 2012, we and our wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Sàrl, entered into the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders and other parties named in the Credit Agreement that provides for a

$240,000

senior secured term loan facility payable in equal quarterly installments of

$12,000

beginning on

June 30, 2012

and a

$200,000

senior secured revolving credit facility through February 7, 2017.

We may elect that the loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 1.25% to 2.00% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement), or (ii) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect, (B) Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, and (C) Eurodollar Rate then in effect plus 1.00%, plus in each case of (A), (B) or (C), 0.25% to 1.00% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement).


Interest is payable quarterly for Base Rate loans and, in the case of LIBOR-based loans, at the end of the applicable interest period, with the principal due on February 7, 2017, the maturity date.

Our obligations under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and are required to be guaranteed by certain of our future domestic subsidiaries.  The obligations of Alexion Pharma International Sàrl under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us, certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries, and certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and are required to be guaranteed by certain of our future subsidiaries.  All obligations of each borrower under the credit facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of each borrower's assets and the assets of certain guarantors, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries and real estate located in Smithfield, Rhode Island, but excluding intellectual property and assets of certain foreign subsidiaries.

The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. Further, the Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults.  If an event of default occurs, the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan.

Operating Leases

Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease approximately

235,300

square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut and approximately

40,000

square feet of space at our regional executive and sales offices in Lausanne, Switzerland. In addition to the locations above, we also lease space in other U.S. states and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization.

We believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our on-going activities.

In November 2012, we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately 328,000 square feet of  office and laboratory space to be constructed in New Haven, Connecticut.  The construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2013 and be completed in 2015.  The term of the new lease will commence upon the landlord's substantial completion of the building and will expire 12 years later, with a minimum renewal option of 7 years and a maximum renewal option of 20 years, provided that we expand our lease to include all rentable space in the building.   The lease provides for monthly payments, ranging from $795 to $907, over the term of the lease.  Upon completion of the New Haven facility, we will relocate our headquarters and Cheshire operations to New Haven.

In November 2012, in connection with the planned construction of facilities in New Haven, Connecticut, we also entered into an agreement with the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development which provides for a forgivable loan and grants totaling $26,000 and tax credits of up to $25,000.  The program requires that we meet certain criteria in order to prevent forfeiture or repayment of the loan, grants and credits, which include (i) maintaining corporate headquarters in Connecticut for the next 10 years; and (ii) achieving and maintaining up to 668 full-time employment positions in the State of Connecticut over the next 6 years.  It is unlikely that we will be able to realize the full value of the available tax credits and we are currently exploring alternatives for the disposition of these credits.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we have not received any grant funds or tax credits associated with our agreement with the State of Connecticut.

Commercial Commitments

Our commercial commitments consist of research and development, license, operational, clinical development, and manufacturing cost commitments, along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs, which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with Lonza.


Lonza Agreement

We have supply agreements with Lonza relating to the manufacture of eculizumab and asfotase alfa, which requires payments to Lonza at the inception of contract and upon the initiation and completion of product manufactured.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our plans for future levels of manufacturing by Lonza, which depends upon our commercial requirements, the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of ARIMF.

We have various agreements with Lonza, with remaining total commitments of approximately

$169,000

through 2018.  Such commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances.  If we terminate certain supply agreements with Lonza without cause, we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement.  Under an existing arrangement with Lonza, we also pay Lonza a royalty on sales of Soliris manufactured at ARIMF.

Additional Commercial Commitments

Additional payments related to our commercial commitments, such as licenses, aggregating to approximately

$1,350

, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current preclinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). These amounts are not included in the above table.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Interest Rate Risk

As of

December 31, 2012

, we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds, and we do not believe a change in interest rates would have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In February 2012, we entered into the Credit Agreement with a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR, Prime Rate, Federal Funds Rate or Eurodollar Rate, at our election, plus an applicable credit spread.  We do not expect changes in interest rates related to the Credit Agreement to have a material effect on our financial statements.  At

December 31, 2012

, we had approximately

$149,000

of variable rate debt outstanding.  If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1% for the year, annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately

$1,490

.

Foreign Exchange Market Risk

As a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Swiss Franc against the U.S. dollar. The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables and payables, and product sales denominated in foreign currencies. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. We have substantial operations based in Switzerland to support our business outside the U.S., and accordingly, our expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the value of the Swiss Franc against the U.S. dollar.

We currently have a derivative program in place to achieve the following: 1) limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, using contracts with durations of up to 30 days and 2) hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany product sales, using contracts with durations of up to 36 months. The objectives of this program are to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues. This program utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce, not eliminate, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates.

As of

December 31, 2012

and


, we held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling

$964,189

and

$692,577

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2012

and


, our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of

$17,180

and

$14,854

, respectively.  The increase in outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts resulted primarily from increases in forecasted intercompany revenues.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are multinational commercial banks. We believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material.

Since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities, we do not expect that a hypothetical 10% adverse fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our


foreign currency sensitive net assets, which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our foreign exchange forward contracts. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales.

Credit Risk

As a result of our foreign operations, we are exposed to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business.

We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business.  The credit and economic conditions in Greece, Italy and Spain, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated throughout 2011 and 2012.  These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries.  Substantially all of our accounts receivable due from these countries are due from or backed by sovereign or local governments, and the amount of non-sovereign accounts receivable is not material. Our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in Greece is limited, as we do not have a material amount of accounts receivable in Greece.

As of

December 31, 2012

and


, our total gross accounts receivable in Italy and Spain were approximately

$82,200

and

$77,000

, respectively.  Our net accounts receivable from these countries as of

December 31, 2012

and


are summarized as follows:

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,) as of

December 31, 2012

. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of

December 31, 2012

, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Management of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


Management utilized the criteria set forth in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

. Based on the assessment, management has concluded that, as of

December 31, 2012

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended

December 31, 2012

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Alexion”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders through the innovation, development and commercialization of life-transforming therapeutic products.  Our marketed product Soliris® (eculizumab) is the first and only therapeutic approved for patients with two ultra-rare and severe disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system: paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an ultra-rare and life-threatening blood disorder, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), an ultra-rare and life-threatening genetic disease.  We are also evaluating other potential indications for Soliris in other diseases in which chronic uncontrolled complement activation is the underlying mechanism, and we are progressing with other biotechnology product candidates in ultra-rare and severe disorders which are now in various stages of development. We were incorporated in 1992 and began commercial sale of Soliris in 2007.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexion and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  On February 7, 2012, we acquired Enobia Pharma Corp (Enobia).  All of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition, and Enobia's results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Dividend Policy

We have never paid a cash dividend on shares of our stock. We currently intend to retain our earnings to finance future operations and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We believe the most complex judgments result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and are significant to our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The most significant areas involving estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows:

•

Revenue recognition;

•

Contingent liabilities;

•

Inventories;

•

Research and development expenses;

•

Share-based compensation;

•

Valuation of goodwill, acquired intangible assets and in-process research and development (IPR&D);

•

Valuation of contingent consideration; and

•

Income taxes.

Foreign Currency Translation

The financial statements of our subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, historical exchange rates for stockholders’ equity and weighted average exchange rates for operating results. Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other

F-8

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations in other income and expense.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value, and include short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Our derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value using observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risks. Our  debt obligations are carried at historical cost, which approximates fair value.  Our contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisitions are valued based on various estimates, including probability of success, discount rates and amount of time until the conditions of the milestone payments are met.

Accounts Receivable

Our standard credit terms vary based on the country of sale and range from


to


days. Our consolidated average days’ sales outstanding ranges from


to


days. We sell Soliris to a limited number of customers, and we evaluate the creditworthiness of each such customer on a regular basis. In certain European countries, sales by us are subject to payment terms that are statutorily determined. This is primarily the case in countries where the payer is government-owned or government-funded, which we consider to be creditworthy. The length of time from sale to receipt of payment in certain countries exceeds our credit terms.  In countries in which collections from customers extend beyond normal payment terms, we seek to collect interest. We record interest on customer receivables as interest income when collected.  For non-interest bearing receivables with an estimated payment beyond one year, we discount the accounts receivable to present value at the date of sale, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue.   Subsequent adjustments for further declines in credit rating are recorded as bad debt expense as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.  We also use judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables if and when collection becomes doubtful, and we also assess on an ongoing basis whether collectibility is reasonably assured at the time of sale.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents, accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts. We invest our cash reserves in money market funds or high-quality marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy.  The stated objectives of our investment policy is to preserve capital, provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements, maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions.

We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business.  The credit and economic conditions in Greece, Italy and Spain, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated throughout 2011 and 2012.  These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries.  Substantially all of our accounts receivable due from these countries are due from or backed by sovereign or local governments, and the amount of non-sovereign accounts receivable is not material. Our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in Greece is limited, as we do not have a material amount of accounts receivable in Greece.

December 31, 2012

and


are summarized as follows:

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the weighted-average cost method.

The components of inventory are as follows:

Capitalization of Inventory Costs

We capitalize inventory produced for commercial sale, including costs incurred prior to regulatory approval but subsequent to the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) when the Company has determined that the inventory has probable future economic benefit.

Products that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory authorities, such as Soliris, are also used in clinical programs to assess the safety and efficacy of the products for usage in diseases that have no been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.  The form of Soliris utilized for both commercial and clinical programs is identical and, as a result, the inventory has an "alternative future use" as defined in authoritative guidance.  Raw materials and purchased drug product associated with clinical development programs are included in inventory and charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes and, therefore, does not have an "alternative future use".

For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery.  Delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to us.  Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered.  We also recognize expense for raw materials purchased for developmental purposes when the raw materials pass quality inspection and we have an obligation to pay for the materials.

We also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property, plant and equipment prior to the approval of the facility by regulatory authorities.

Inventory Write-Offs

We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, which would require adjustments to our inventory values. Soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of


months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to realize the carrying value of the Soliris inventory.

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

Derivative Instruments

We record the fair value of derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value is dependent on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.

All qualifying hedging activities are documented at the inception of the hedge and must meet the definition of highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash. The effectiveness of the qualifying hedge contract is assessed quarterly. We record the fair value of the qualifying hedges in other current assets, other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of qualifying hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, this amount is reclassified into revenue. Any non-qualifying portion of the gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reported in other income and expense.

Prepaid Manufacturing Costs

Cash advances paid by us prior to receipt of the inventory are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs. The cash advances are subject to forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled production. We expect the carrying value of the prepaid manufacturing costs to be fully realized.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We estimate economic lives as follows:

•

Building and improvements—five to thirty years

•

Machinery and laboratory equipment—three to twenty years

•

Computer hardware and software—two to five years

•

Furniture and office equipment—three to seven years

Leasehold improvements and assets under capital lease arrangements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life or the term of the respective lease. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Construction-in-progress reflects amounts incurred for property, plant, or equipment construction or improvements that have not been placed in service.

Intangible Assets

Our intangible assets consist of licenses, patents, purchased technology and acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D).  Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur as described in "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" below.

Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired businesses and the fair value of their identifiable tangible and intangible net assets and is not amortized. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill might not be recoverable. No impairment charges have occurred as a result of our annual impairment assessments.  We test our goodwill annually for impairment on December 31.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived assets, which are primarily comprised of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or group of assets is not

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, IPR&D is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the IPR&D.

In the third quarter of 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of

$26,300

associated with an indefinite-lived intangible asset acquired in connection with the purchase of Taligen.  We did not recognize any other impairment loss for long-lived assets during the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


.

Contingent Consideration

We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date.  On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.  The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.

Contingent Liabilities

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our operating results.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method, with the purchase price of the common stock recorded separately as a deduction from stockholders' equity.

Revenue Recognition

Our principal source of revenue is product sales. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, and we have no further performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon receipt of the product by the end customer, which is typically a hospital, physician’s office, private or government pharmacy or other health care facility. Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, such as value-added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in our statements of operations and do not impact net product sales.

In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. We also sell Soliris to government agencies. Outside the United States, our customers are primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers and distributors.

Because of factors such as the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from product sale to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights, Soliris customers often carry limited inventory. We also monitor inventory within our sales channels to determine whether deferrals are appropriate based on factors such as inventory levels, contractual terms and financial strength of distributors.

In addition to sales in countries where Soliris is commercially available, we have also recorded revenue on sales for patients receiving Soliris treatment through named-patient programs.  The relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named-patient basis where Soliris has not received final approval for commercial sale.

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid in the United States and other programs outside the United States, as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made. Generally, the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months.

We have entered into volume-based arrangements with governments in certain countries in which reimbursement is limited to a contractual amount.  Under this type of arrangement, amounts billed in excess of the contractual limitation are repaid to these governments as a rebate. We estimate incremental discounts resulting from these contractual limitations, based on estimated sales during the limited period, and we apply the discount percentage to product shipments as a reduction of revenue. Our calculations related to these arrangements require estimation of sales during the limitation period, and adjustments in these estimates may have an impact in the period in which an adjustment is made.

We record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue, unless we receive an identifiable and separate benefit for the consideration and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received.  If both conditions are met, we record the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense.  These costs are typically known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception. We record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including payroll and benefits, pre-clinical, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, manufacturing development and scale-up costs, product development and regulatory costs, contract services and other outside contractor costs, research license fees, depreciation and amortization of lab facilities, and lab supplies. These costs are expensed as incurred. We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the vendors that perform the services.

Share-Based Compensation

We have one share-based compensation plan known as the 2004 Incentive Plan. Under this plan, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and other stock-related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary. To date, share-based compensation issued under the plan consists of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock at the dates of grant. Generally, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to employees fully vest four years from the grant date. Stock options have a contractual term of 10 years. We recognize share-based compensation expense, based on the fair value of stock awards, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which typically equals the vesting period.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share (EPS) are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted EPS, net income is adjusted for the after-tax amount of interest and deferred financing costs associated with our convertible debt, and the denominator reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, unvested restricted stock, unvested restricted stock units or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, using the treasury stock method, as well as the potential dilution if the remaining convertible notes were converted to common stock.

Income Taxes

We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that has been taken or we expect to take on income tax returns if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes changes in equity that are excluded from net income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in pension liabilities, unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses on hedge contracts. Certain of these changes in equity are reflected net of tax.

A summary of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component is summarized as follows:

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard on the presentation of comprehensive income.  The new standard eliminated the current alternative to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.  Under the new standard, companies can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive statements.  We adopted the provisions of this standard during the first quarter of 2012.

In July 2012, the FASB issued a new standard which amends the guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill.  The new standard allows companies an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the fair value of the asset.  Under the new standard, a company is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the company determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not impaired.  The new standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted the provisions of this guidance for our 2012 annual impairment test.  The adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions

Acquisition of Enobia Pharma Corp.

On February 7, 2012, we acquired Enobia,  a privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Enobia were recorded

F-15

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values. The reported consolidated financial condition after completion of the acquisition reflects these fair values. Enobia's results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  The acquisition is intended to further our objective to develop and commercialize therapies for patients with severe, ultra-rare and life-threatening disorders.  Enobia's lead product candidate asfotase alfa, is a human recombinant targeted alkaline phosphatase enzyme-replacement therapy for patients suffering with hypophosphatasia (HPP), an ultra-rare, life-threatening, genetic metabolic disease for which there are no approved treatments.

We made an upfront cash payment of

$623,876

for

100%

of Enobia's capital stock.  Additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of

$470,000

would be due upon reaching various regulatory and sales milestones.  We financed the acquisition with existing cash and proceeds from our new credit facility.

A reconciliation of upfront payments in accordance with the purchase agreement to the total purchase price is presented below:

The initial estimate of fair value of contingent consideration was

$117,000

, which was recorded as a noncurrent liability. We determined the fair value of these obligations to pay additional milestone payments using various estimates, including probabilities of success, discount rates and amount of time until the conditions of the milestone payments are met. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, representing a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The resulting probability-weighted cash flows were discounted using a cost of debt rate of

5.2%

for developmental milestones and a weighted average cost of capital rate of

13.0%

for commercial milestones.  These rates are representative of market participant assumptions. The range of estimated milestone payments is from

zero

if no clinical milestones are achieved for any product to

$470,000

if various regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

Subsequent to the acquisition date, we have adjusted the contingent consideration to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in operating earnings. Changes in fair values reflect new information about the probability and timing of meeting the conditions of the milestone payments. In the absence of new information, changes in fair value will only reflect the interest component of contingent consideration related to the passage of time as development work progresses towards the achievement of the milestones. At

December 31, 2012

, the fair value of the contingent consideration for Enobia was

$124,411

.  Changes in fair value of the consideration for Enobia was

$7,411

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.

The fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are based on preliminary estimates and are subject to change.  The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:

F-16

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

Asset categories acquired in the Enobia acquisition included working capital, fixed assets, deferred tax assets and IPR&D. The fair value of working capital was determined to approximate book values.  The fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been prepared on a preliminary basis, and changes to that allocation may occur as additional information becomes available related to indemnification assets and deferred taxes.

Intangible assets associated with IPR&D projects relate to Enobia's lead product candidate, asfotase alfa. The estimated fair value of

$587,000

was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, a variation of the income approach.  The multi-period excess earnings method estimates the value of an intangible asset equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to that intangible asset.  The fair value using the multi-period excess earnings method was dependent on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Enobia of

13.0%

, which represents a rate of return that a market participant would expect for these assets.

The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition. We do not expect any portion of this goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill attributable to our acquisition of Enobia has been recorded as a noncurrent asset and is not amortized, but is subject to an annual review for impairment.  The factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill included the synergies that are specific to our business and not available to market participants, including our unique ability to commercialize therapies for rare diseases, our skills and relationships related to biologics manufacturing, our existing relationships with specialty physicians who can identify patients with HPP and a global distribution network to facilitate immediate drug delivery.

We recorded a net deferred tax liability of

$31,471

.  This amount was primarily comprised of

$78,527

related to IPR&D, offset by acquired net operating losses and research credit carryovers totaling

$47,056

.

For the year ended

December 31, 2012

, we recorded

$6,794

of expenses associated with the operations of Enobia from February 7, 2012 through March 31, 2012 in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.   Effective April 1, 2012, the operations of Enobia were integrated into our operations.

$367,000

in contingent milestone payments upon achievement of various development and commercial milestones.  The range of estimated milestone payments is from

related to the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to this acquisition.  The decrease in fair value was a result of a decreased likelihood of payments for contingent consideration due to the negative scientific findings, decrease in value and related deprioritization of the age-related macular degeneration program (Note 5).

Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmbH

On February 8, 2011, we acquired certain patents and assets from Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Orphatec) related to an investigational therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A, an ultra-rare genetic disorder characterized by severe brain damage and rapid death in newborns. We made initial payments of

$3,050

in cash and may make additional future payments of up to

$42,000

in contingent milestone payments upon various development, regulatory and commercial milestones.  The range of estimated milestone payments is from

zero

if no products gain market approval to

if all indications for up to two products gain both U.S. and European marketing approval and reach applicable sales levels.

The initial estimate of fair value of contingent consideration was

In July 2006, we acquired a manufacturing plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island for the commercial production of Soliris and development and manufacturing of future products. Since this date, we have incurred costs related to the construction of the plant to support full-scale commercial manufacturing. We have also capitalized costs related to validation activities which are directly attributable to preparing the facility for its intended use, including engineering runs and inventory production necessary to obtain approval of the facility from government regulators for the production of a commercially approved drug. In December 2009, we received final regulatory approval for production of commercial quantities of eculizumab by the European Commission. Accordingly, our plant was considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use. As a result of the approval, we placed the plant in service.

The production of inventory for preparing the facility for its intended use requires two types of production: engineering runs which are used for testing purposes only and do not result in saleable inventory, and validation runs which are used for validating equipment and may result in saleable inventory.  The costs associated with inventory produced during engineering runs and normal production losses during validation runs are capitalized to fixed assets and depreciated over the asset's useful life.  Saleable inventory produced during the validation process is initially treated as a fixed asset; however, upon regulatory approval, this inventory is reclassified to inventory and expensed in cost of goods sold or research and development expenses as product has been sold or utilized in R&D activities, respectively.  Abnormal production costs incurred during the validation process are expensed as incurred.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Intangible assets and goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, are as follows:

Amortization of our intangible assets was approximately

$5,660

,

$5,087

and

$4,552

for the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


, respectively. Assuming no changes in the gross cost basis of intangible assets, the estimated amortization of intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows:

As of

December 31, 2012

, we have recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets of

$628,250

, which consists of

$587,000

,

$33,200

and

$8,050

of purchased IPR&D from our acquisitions of Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec, respectively.  As of

December 31, 2012

, except as noted below, there have been no significant changes that would impact the carrying value of IPR&D since the date of acquisition.

During the third quarter of 2012, we reviewed for impairment the value of an early stage, preclinical indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the Taligen acquisition.  We initiated such review based on our evaluation of negative scientific findings associated with our development of a different asset for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, the likelihood of success for ophthalmic use and the value that can be obtained from a market participant in an arm's length transaction. These developments led us to deprioritize the development of this acquired asset.  As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of

$26,300

to write-down this asset to fair value, which was determined to be de minimis based on the value of the asset to a market participant in an arm's length transaction.  The fair value of this IPR&D asset was determined using the income approach, which used significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.  These unobservable inputs included, among other things, risk-adjusted forecast future cash flows to be generated by this asset, contributory asset charges for other assets employed in this IPR&D project and the determination of an appropriate discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital of

22.0%

to be applied in calculating the present value of future cash flows.  The impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We operate internationally and, in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The exposures result from portions of our revenues, as well as the related receivables, and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. We manage our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of up to


months, to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The purpose of the hedges of intercompany revenue is to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon contract inception. At

December 31, 2012

, we have open contracts with notional amounts totaling

$801,835

that qualified for hedge accounting.

The impact on accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and earnings from foreign exchange contracts that qualified as cash flow hedges, for the years ended

are as follows:

Assuming no change in foreign exchange rates from market rates at

December 31, 2012

,

$11,200

of a gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified to revenue over the next 12 months.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of approximately


days, designed to limit the balance sheet exposure of monetary assets and liabilities. We enter into these hedges to reduce the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on our operating results. Hedge accounting is not applied to these derivative instruments as gains and losses on these hedge transactions are designed to offset gains and losses on underlying balance sheet exposures. As of

December 31, 2012

, the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts where  hedge accounting is not applied was

$162,354

.

We recognized a gain of

$3,518

and

$790

, in other income and expense, for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively, associated with the foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments under the guidance. These amounts were largely offset by gains or losses in monetary assets and liabilities.

Debt

On February 7, 2012, we and our wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Sàrl, entered into a Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, that provides for a

$240,000

senior secured term loan facility

F-22

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

payable in equal quarterly installments of

$12,000

starting

June 30, 2012

and a

$200,000

senior secured revolving credit facility through February 7, 2017.  In addition to borrowings upon prior notice, the revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit up to

$60,000

and borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, of up to

$10,000

.  Borrowings can be used for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.  With the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the term loan facility and/or the revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed

$150,000

.

We may elect that the loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i)

LIBOR

plus

1.25%

to

2.00%

depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement), or (ii) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A)

Prime Rate

then in effect, (B)

Federal Funds Rate

then in effect plus

0.50%

, and (C)

Eurodollar Rate

then in effect plus

1.00%

, plus in each case of (A), (B) or (C),

0.25%

to

1.00%

depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement).  Interest is payable quarterly for Base Rate loans and, in the case of LIBOR-based loans, at the end of the applicable interest period, with the principal due on

February 7, 2017

, the maturity date.

Our obligations under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and are required to be guaranteed by certain of our future domestic subsidiaries.  The obligations of Alexion Pharma International Sàrl under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us, certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries, and certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and are required to be guaranteed by certain of our future subsidiaries.  All obligations of each borrower under the credit facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of each borrower's assets and the assets of certain guarantors, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries and real estate located in Smithfield, Rhode Island, but excluding intellectual property and assets of certain foreign subsidiaries.

The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. Further, the Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults.  If an event of default occurs, the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan.

In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, we paid

$6,184

in financing costs which are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt.

In connection with the acquisition of Enobia in February 2012, we borrowed

$240,000

under the term loan facility and

$80,000

under the revolving facility, and we used our available cash for the remaining purchase price.  During 2012, we repaid the revolving facility in full and made payments of

$91,000

against the term loan.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we had

$149,000

outstanding on the term loan.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we had open letters of credit of

$9,695

, and our borrowing availability under the revolving facility was

$190,305

.

The fair value of our long term debt, which is measured using Level 2 inputs, approximates book value.

On February 7, 2012, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Prior Credit Agreement), dated March 7, 2011 was terminated.  All outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement were canceled.  The Prior Credit Agreement was terminated in connection with, and simultaneously with, execution of the Credit Agreement described above.

Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

We rely on Lonza Group AG and its affiliates (Lonza), a third party manufacturer, to produce a portion of commercial and clinical quantities of Soliris and for clinical quantities of asfotase alfa, and we have contracted and expect to continue contracting for product finishing, vial filling and packaging through third parties.  We have various agreements with Lonza,

F-23

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

with remaining total commitments of approximately

$169,000

through 2018.  Such commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances.  If we terminate certain supply agreements with Lonza without cause, we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement.  Under an existing arrangement with Lonza, we also pay Lonza a royalty on sales of Soliris manufactured at ARIMF.

Contingent Liabilities

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our operating results.

In October 2012, we entered into a settlement and non-exclusive license agreement with a third party.  Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of approximately

$38,000

in the fourth quarter of 2012 and will pay royalties on sales of Soliris in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  As a result of the settlement and non-exclusive license agreement, we reduced our estimate for probable contingent liabilities and have recorded a gain in cost of sales of

$53,377

in the third quarter 2012.  At

December 31, 2012

and


, we have recorded

$25,450

and

$82,010

, respectively, in accrued expenses for probable contingent liabilities and royalties owed to third parties.

On January 26, 2011, Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics, Inc. (Novartis) filed a civil action against us and other biopharmaceutical companies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Novartis claims willful infringement by us of U.S. Patent No. 5,688,688. Novartis seeks, among other things, monetary damages. If it is finally determined that we infringe the Novartis patent, we may be required to pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Soliris regarding certain manufacturing technology. Although we do not believe that the manufacture of Soliris infringes a valid patent claim owned by Novartis, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in defending against such action. Given the early stages of this litigation, management does not currently believe a loss related to this matter is probable or that the potential magnitude of such loss or range of loss, if any, can be reasonably estimated.

In addition to the Novartis claim, other third parties may claim that the development, manufacture, use or commercialization of Soliris or other drugs under development infringes patents owned or granted to such third parties. We are aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the manufacture, use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, and recombinant human single chain antibodies. Soliris and many of our product candidates are genetically engineered antibodies, including recombinant humanized antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, or recombinant human single chain antibodies. In respect to some of these patents, we have obtained licenses or expect to obtain licenses. We estimate our obligations for probable contingent liabilities based on our assessment of estimated royalties potentially owed to other third parties. A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could have a material adverse effect on our business. However, the amount of such loss or a range of loss, if any, beyond amounts currently accrued, cannot be reasonably estimated.

Operating Leases

As of

December 31, 2012

, we lease our headquarters and primary research and development facilities in Cheshire, Connecticut. The leases are set to expire in in 2016 and 2020, and we would be subject to contractual penalties of approximately

$3,800

if the leases were to terminate early. Monthly fixed rent started at approximately

$287

, increasing to approximately

$294

over the term of this lease. We also lease space for our regional executive and sales offices in Lausanne, Switzerland, as well as in other U.S. states and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization.

Aggregate lease expense was

$16,758

,

$10,424

and

$6,980

for the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


, respectively. Lease expense is being recorded on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease terms.

In November 2012, we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately

328,000

square feet of office and laboratory space to be constructed in New Haven, Connecticut.  The construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2013 and be completed in 2015.  The term of the new lease will commence upon the landlord's substantial completion of the building and will expire

12 years

after the completion date, with a minimum renewal option of

7 years

and a maximum renewal option of

20 years

, provided that we expand our lease to include all rentable space in the building.   The lease provides for monthly payments, ranging from

$795

to

$907

, over the term of the lease.  Upon completion of the new facility, we will relocate our

headquarters and Cheshire operations to New Haven.

In November 2012, in connection with the planned construction of facilities in New Haven, Connecticut, we also entered into an agreement with the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development which provides for a forgivable loan and grants totaling

$26,000

and tax credits of up to

$25,000

.  The program requires that we meet certain criteria in order to prevent forfeiture or repayment of the loan, grants and credits, which include (i) maintaining corporate headquarters in Connecticut for the next

10 years

; and (ii) achieving and maintaining up to


full-time employment positions in the State of Connecticut over the next

6 years

.  It is unlikely that we will be able to realize the full value of the available tax credits and we are currently exploring alternatives for the disposition of these credits.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we have not received any grant funds or tax credits associated with our agreement with the State of Connecticut.

Aggregate future minimum annual rental payments, exclusive of costs related to our new operating lease for facilities to be constructed in New Haven, Connecticut, which are contingent upon construction of the facility, for the next five years and thereafter under non-cancellable operating leases (including facilities and equipment) as of

December 31, 2012

are:

License and Research and Development Agreements

We have entered into a number of license, research and development and manufacturing development agreements since our inception. These agreements have been made with various research institutions, universities, contractors, collaborators, and government agencies in order to advance and obtain technologies and services related to our business.

License agreements generally provide for us to pay an initial fee followed by annual minimum royalty payments. Additionally, certain agreements call for future payments upon the attainment of agreed upon milestones, such as, but not limited to, Investigational New Drug (IND) application or approval of Biologics License Application. These agreements require minimum royalty payments based on sales of products developed from the applicable technologies, if any.

Clinical and manufacturing development agreements generally provide for us to fund manufacturing development and on-going clinical trials. Clinical trial and development agreements include contract services and outside contractor services including contracted clinical site services related to patient enrollment for our clinical trials. Manufacturing development agreements include clinical manufacturing and manufacturing development and scale-up. We have executed a large-scale product supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG for the long-term commercial manufacture of Soliris.

The minimum fixed payments (assuming non-termination of the above agreements) as of

December 31, 2012

, for each of the next five years are as follows:

Income Taxes

The income tax provision is based on income before income taxes as follows:

The components of the income tax provision are as follows:

We reversed the valuation allowance against certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2010 where realization of those assets was more likely than not. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where the realization is not certain. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.

Due to the amount of our NOL’s and credit carryforwards, we do not anticipate paying substantial U.S. federal income taxes in the next twelve months. We are currently paying cash taxes in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net operating losses.

At

December 31, 2012

, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of

$453,617

and

$97,452

, respectively. These NOL's are inclusive of federal and state net operating losses of

$10,337

from our acquisition of Enobia.  Included in the NOL’s are federal and state NOL’s of

$436,893

and

$45,850

, respectively, attributable to excess tax benefits from the exercise of non-qualified stock options. The tax benefits attributable to these NOL’s will be credited directly to additional paid in capital when utilized to offset taxes payable. Our NOL’s expire between 2021 and 2032. We also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of

$80,755

and

$7,513

, respectively. These income tax credits expire between 2014 and 2032. Additionally, included in these income tax credit carryforwards are federal income tax credit carryforwards of

$59,881

attributable to excess tax benefits from the exercise of non-qualified stock options.

Certain stock option exercises resulted in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant. Although these additional tax benefits or “windfalls” are reflected in net operating loss carryforwards, pursuant to authoritative guidance, the additional tax benefit associated with the windfall is not recognized until the deduction reduces regular taxes payable. Accordingly, since the tax benefit does not reduce our current taxes payable due to net operating loss carryforwards, these “windfall” tax benefits are not reflected in our net operating losses and credit carryforward in deferred tax assets for all periods presented.

We were granted an incentive tax holiday in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland effective January 1, 2010, with a final expiration date in 2019. The tax holiday will exempt the Company from most local corporate income taxes in Switzerland through the end of 2014 and is expected to be renewed for an additional


years. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by

$3,173

in


and

$2,506

in


.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer's ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of

50%

over a three-year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year. Additionally, in connection with our acquisition of Enobia, we acquired

$10,337

of net operating losses subject to a limitation. However, we believe that such limitations are not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any significant amount of our federal NOL’s and income tax credit carryforwards.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. The reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:

In 2012, as a result of structuring the Enobia business, we recorded income tax expense of

$21,812

in our income statement.  The structuring will require us to make a cash payment of approximately

$50,000

in early 2013, and this amount is fully accrued on our balance sheet as of

December 31, 2012

.

In September 2011, we completed our assessment of the impact the election to claim federal foreign tax credits and the federal orphan drug credits would have on our historical tax returns.  Based on this assessment, management elected to claim both the foreign tax credit for the tax year ended December 31, 2010 and orphan drug credit for the tax years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.  The net federal income tax benefit recorded during 2011 as a result of the election to claim the federal foreign tax credit for 2010 and the federal orphan drug credit for 2010 and 2009 was approximately

$15,400

Provisions have been made for deferred taxes based on the differences between the basis of the assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the basis of the assets and liabilities for tax purposes using currently enacted tax rates and regulations that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, which exclude "windfall" tax benefits, are as follows:

We follow authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition.

The beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits reconciles as follows:

We recognize the interest accrued and the penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties and the tax expense was not significant as of

December 31, 2012

. Unless related to excess tax benefits from stock options, all of our unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would have a favorable impact on the effective tax rate.

We file federal and state income tax returns in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have statute of limitations ranging from


to


years. However, the statute of limitations could be extended due to our NOL carryforward position in a number of our jurisdictions. The tax authorities generally have the ability to review income tax returns for periods where the statute of limitation has previously expired and can subsequently adjust the NOL carryforward or tax credit amounts. Accordingly, we do not expect to reverse any significant portion of the unrecognized tax benefits within the next year.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced an examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2008 and 2009 during the second quarter 2011 that is now anticipated to be completed within the next twelve months.  As a result of this audit, it is

F-28

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change over the next twelve months.  The impact to our unrecognized tax benefits is difficult to determine based on the preliminary stage of discussions with the IRS.

As of

December 31, 2012

, we have not paid U.S. income taxes on

$184,321

of undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be either permanently reinvested or subject to a tax free liquidation and do not give rise to significant incremental U.S. taxes.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes which might be payable on our undistributed earnings due to a variety of factors, including the timing, extent and nature of any repatriation.  While our expectation is that all foreign undistributed earnings are permanently invested, there could be certain unforeseen future events that could impact our permanent reinvestment assertion.  Such events include acquisitions, corporate restructuring or tax law changes not currently contemplated.

During the fourth quarter of


, we applied for and received a favorable tax incentive from the State of Rhode Island based on increasing our employment levels at our manufacturing plant. Additionally, we received a favorable ruling from the State of Rhode Island related to our state apportionment.  The deferred tax benefit attributable to these items recorded in the fourth quarter was

$4,240

.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock

At

December 31, 2012

, we have one stock option plan, the 2004 Incentive Plan (“2004 Plan”). Under the 2004 Plan, restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively referred to as Restricted Stock), incentive and non-qualified stock options, and other stock-related awards, may be granted for up to a maximum of

35,874

shares to our directors, officers, key employees and consultants. Stock options granted under all Plans have a maximum contractual term of

ten

years from the date of grant, have an exercise price not less than the fair value of the stock on the grant date and generally vest over four years.

The following table summarizes the components of share-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations:

, and changes during the year then ended is presented in the table and narrative below:

Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


was

$308,009

,

$114,712

,


and


was

$27,301

,

$23,485

and

$20,039

, respectively.

The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following ranges of weighted average assumptions:

The expected stock price volatility rates are based on historical volatilities of our common stock. The risk-free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. The average expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We have evaluated three distinct employee groups in determining the expected life assumptions, and we estimate the expected life of stock options based on historical experience of exercises, cancellations and forfeitures of our stock options.

A summary of the status of our nonvested Restricted Stock and changes during the period then ended is as follows:

Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock

In February 1997, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of

one

preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock (including all future issuances of common stock). Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised

F-30

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010

(amounts in thousands except per share amounts)

to purchase

one hundredth

of a share of a new series of preferred stock at an exercise price of

$75.00

, subject to adjustment (see below). The rights may be exercised only after a public announcement that a party acquired

20%

or more of our common stock or after commencement or public announcement to make a tender offer for

20%

or more of our common stock. The rights, which do not have voting rights, expire on March 6, 2017, and may be redeemed by us at a price of

$0.01

per right at any time prior to their expiration or the acquisition of

20%

or more of our stock. The preferred stock purchasable upon exercise of the rights will have a minimum preferential dividend of

$10.00

per year, but will be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, a dividend of


times the dividend declared on a share of Common Stock. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the shares of preferred stock will be entitled to receive a minimum liquidation payment of

$100

per share, but will be entitled to receive an aggregate liquidation payment equal to


times the payment to be made per share of Common Stock.

On February 23, 2007, our Board of Directors amended the purchase price under the preferred stock purchase rights. Further, as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock effected on August 22, 2008, the number of shares of preferred stock purchasable upon proper exercise of each preferred stock purchase right automatically adjusted from

one hundredth

of a share of preferred stock to

two hundredths

of a share of preferred stock. Therefore, the purchase price, for each

two hundredths

of a share of preferred stock to be issued upon the exercise of each preferred stock purchase right is

$300.00

. Except for the increase in the purchase price, the terms and conditions of the rights remain unchanged.

In the event that we are acquired in a merger, other business combination transaction, or

50%

or more of our assets, cash flow, or earning power are sold, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a right shall have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current exercise price, that number of shares of common stock of the surviving company which at the time of such transaction would have a market value of

two

times the exercise price of the right.

Common Stock

In May 2012, in conjunction with our addition into the S&P 500 Index, we completed the sale of

5,000

shares of our common stock in a public offering.  The net proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering were

$462,212

.

Share Repurchases

In November 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

$400,000

of our common stock.  This repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to acquire a particular number of shares.  The program may be discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion.  Under the program, we repurchased


shares of our common stock at a cost of

$11,553

during the fourth quarter of

Fair Value Measurement

Authoritative guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.

Valuation Techniques

Items classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy, consisting of an institutional money market fund held at a multinational financial institution, are valued based upon pricing of securities with similar investment characteristics and holdings. Our derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange derivatives that are measured at fair value using observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risks. Based on these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Items classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, consisting of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions, were valued based on various estimates, including probability of success, discount rates and amount of time until the conditions of the milestone payments are met.

As of

December 31, 2012

, there has not been any impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties’ credit risks.

Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plan

We have one qualified 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to the statutory allowable amount for any calendar year. We make matching contributions equal to:

•

$1.00

for each dollar contributed up to the first

4%

of an individual’s base salary and incentive cash bonus; and

•

$0.50

for each dollar contributed of the next

2%

of such compensation.

For the years ended

December 31, 2012

,


and


, we recorded matching contributions of approximately

$3,700

,

$2,882

and

$1,893

, respectively.

Defined Benefit Plans

We maintain defined benefit plans for employees outside the United States, including retirement benefit plans required by applicable local law. The plans are valued by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The liabilities correspond to the projected benefit obligations of which the discounted net present value is calculated based on years of employment, expected salary increases, and pension adjustments.

The following table sets forth the funded status and the amounts recognized for defined benefit plans:

The Company measures the fair value of plan assets based on the prices that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The following table presents total plan assets by investment category as of

December 31, 2012

and the classification of each investment category within the fair value hierarchy with respect to the inputs used to measure fair value:

All plan asset investments are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are valued utilizing observable prices for similar instruments and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active.  The investment objective is to maximize the overall return from investment income and capital appreciation consistent with the preservation of capital considering investment strategies and asset allocation limits as determined by pension law. The targeted allocation for these funds (if any) is as follows:

At

December 31, 2012

, we have recorded a liability of

$8,478

in other non-current liabilities and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, of

$5,712

related to an additional minimum liability.

The following table provides the weighted average assumptions used to calculate net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations:

The discount rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation represent the yield on high quality AA-rated corporate bonds for periods that match the duration of the benefit obligations.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents a weighted average of expected returns per asset category.

The rate of return considers historical and estimated future risk free rates of return as well as risk premiums for the relevant investment categories.

The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows:

Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) are as follows:
