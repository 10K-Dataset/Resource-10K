Business.

General

Waste Management, Inc. is a
holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. When the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When we use the term “WM,” we are referring only to Waste Management, Inc., the parent holding company.

WM was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name “USA Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a Delaware company in
1995. In a 1998 merger, the Illinois-based waste services company formerly known as Waste Management, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM and changed its name to Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”). At the same time,
our parent holding company changed its name from USA Waste Services to Waste Management, Inc. Like WM, WM Holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries. For details on the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of WM, WM Holdings and their subsidiaries, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our principal executive
offices are located at 1001 Fannin Street, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone number is (713) 512-6200. Our website address is www.wm.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form

8-K

are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the SEC. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WM.”

We are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services. We partner with our residential,
commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. Our “Solid Waste”
business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services. Our “Traditional Solid Waste” business excludes
our recycling and resource recovery services. Through our subsidiaries, we are also a leading developer, operator and owner of landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities in the United States. In December 2014, we sold
our Wheelabrator business, which provides

waste-to-energy

services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. During 2016, our largest customer represented 1% of annual
revenues. We employed approximately 41,200 people as of December 31, 2016.

We own or operate 248 landfill sites, which is the
largest network of landfills in North America. In order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets, where the distance to landfills is typically farther, we manage 310 transfer stations that consolidate, compact and transport waste
efficiently and economically. We also use waste to create energy, recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity. We are a leading recycler in North America, handling
materials that include paper, cardboard, glass, plastic and metal. We provide cost-efficient, environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities, businesses and households across the United States and Canada as well as other services that
supplement our Traditional Solid Waste business.

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the
environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming more complex, and our aim is to address the current needs, while anticipating
the expanding and evolving needs, of our customers. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a
more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader, we have the



Index to Financial Statements

expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing
environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive.

Our fundamental strategy has not changed; we remain
dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement, with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions, the
regulatory environment, asset and resource availability and current technology. We believe that focused differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets, will deliver profitable growth and
competitive advantages. Simultaneously, we believe the combination of cost control, process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the Company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and
enhanced service quality. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as our
recycling operations.

We believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry. In
addition, we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and common stock repurchases. In December 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.41 to $0.425
per share for dividends declared in 2017, which is a 3.7% increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2016. This is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows and marks the 14th consecutive year of dividend
increases. All quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

Operations

General

We
evaluate, oversee and manage the financial performance of our Solid Waste business subsidiaries through our 17 Areas. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments. In December 2014, we
sold our Wheelabrator business, which provides

waste-to-energy

services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Refer to Note 19
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this divestiture. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business as described below. These operations are presented in this
report as “Other.”

We have expanded certain of our operations through acquisitions, which are discussed further in Note 19 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2016, Waste Management Inc. of Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, acquired certain operations and business assets of Southern Waste Systems/Sun Recycling (“SWS”) in Southern Florida.
The acquired business assets include residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste collection, processing/recycling and transfer operations, equipment, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements. In March 2015, we acquired Deffenbaugh
Disposal, Inc., (“Deffenbaugh”), one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest with assets including collection operations, transfer stations, recycling facilities and landfills.

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network. Collection
involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station, material recovery facility (“MRF”) or disposal site. We generally provide collection services under one of two types of
arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we have a

three-year

service agreement. The fees under the agreements are influenced by factors such as
collection frequency, type of collection equipment we furnish, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel
containers to most customers to store their solid waste between pick-up dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many are designed to be lifted mechanically and either
emptied into a truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site. By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality, homeowners’ association or some other regional authority that gives us the exclusive right to
service all or a portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are typically for periods of three to seven years. We also provide services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to households. The fees for residential
collection are either paid by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service.

Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in North America. At December 31, 2016, we owned or operated 243 solid
waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills, which represents the largest network of landfills in North America. Solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of water
and air pollution, and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation. A landfill must meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations during its design, construction, operation and closure. The operation and closure activities of a
solid waste landfill include excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These operations are carefully
planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace.

All solid waste management companies must
have access to a disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. The significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and, as a result, third-party haulers often dispose of waste at
our landfills. It is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer to as internalization, rather than using

third-party

disposal
facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated



Index to Financial Statements

margins and stronger operating cash flows. The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including competition and the type and
weight or volume of solid waste deposited.

Under environmental laws, the federal government (or states with delegated authority) must
issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also comply with specialized operating
standards. Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these treatments involve the
separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner designed to provide

long-term

containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable
geologic formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers.

Transfer.

At December 31, 2016, we owned or operated 310 transfer stations in North America. We deposit waste at these stations, as do
other waste haulers. The solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities. Fees charged to
third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors.

The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would
otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect. It enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks, railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks,
allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and (iii) we can
retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do
not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties. There are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for municipalities. In most cases, we own the permits
and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station.

Recycling.

Our recycling operations provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage. We were the first major solid waste company to
focus on residential single-stream recycling, which allows customers to mix recyclable paper, plastic and glass in one bin. Residential single-stream programs have greatly increased the recycling volumes. Single-stream recycling is possible through
the use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies. We have also been advancing the single-stream recycling programs for commercial applications. Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for
processing and resale or other disposition. Our recycling operations include the following:

Materials processing

— Through our collection operations, we collect recyclable materials from residential, commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our MRFs for processing. At December 31, 2016, we operated 95 MRFs where paper,
cardboard, metals, plastics, glass, construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale.



Index to Financial Statements

Commodities recycling

— We market and resell recyclable commodities
globally. We manage the marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market demands and product quality.

Recycling brokerage services

— We also provide recycling brokerage services, which involve managing the marketing
of recyclable materials for third parties. The experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage volumes for third parties. Utilizing the resources
and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers, we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements.

Some of the recyclable materials processed in our MRFs are purchased from various sources, including third parties and our own operations. The
price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate.” In some cases, rebates are based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum

per-ton

rates but are generally based upon
the price we receive for sales of processed goods, market conditions and transportation costs. As a result, changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers, which are recorded as
“Operating expenses” within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In recent years, we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an
acceptable margin on the materials we process and sell.

Other.

Other services we provide include the following:

Although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services, our strategic accounts organization, which is
managed by our Strategic Business Solutions organization, works with customers whose locations span the United States. Our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service, billing and management of accounts to streamline the
administration of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs.

Our Energy and Environmental Services
organization offers our customers in all Areas a variety of services in collaboration with our Area and strategic accounts programs, including (i) construction and remediation services; (ii) services associated with the disposal of fly
ash, residue generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks; (iii) in-plant services, where our employees work

full-time

inside our customers’ facilities to provide

full-service

waste management solutions and consulting services; this service is managed through our Energy and Environmental Services organization but reflected principally in our collection business and
(iv) specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations; revenues for this service are also reflected principally in our collection business. Our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to
provide customers with full management of their waste. The breadth of our service offerings and the familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate,
identifying recycling opportunities, determining the most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and
environmentally friendly.

We develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our WM Renewable Energy
organization. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil
fuel. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, in the same category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At December 31, 2016, we had 131 landfill gas beneficial use
projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills. For 103 of these projects, the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators. The electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal utilities or
power cooperatives. For 16 of these projects, the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. For 11 of these projects, the landfill gas is processed
to pipeline-quality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers. For one of these projects, the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used as vehicle fuel.



Index to Financial Statements

We continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and
solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations. These investments include joint ventures, acquisitions and partial ownership interests. The solutions and services include the collection of project waste, including construction debris
and household or yard waste, through our Bagster

®

program; the development, operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities; operation of a landfill

gas-to-liquid

natural gas plant; solar powered trash compactors; and organic waste-to-fuel conversion technology. We also offer portable self-storage and long distance moving services through a joint venture;
fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker

®

program; portable restroom servicing under the name
Port-o-Let

®

; and street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties.

Wheelabrator.

On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash
proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain

post-closing

adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from
divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator
facilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these agreements.

Wheelabrator provides

waste-to-energy

services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Our Wheelabrator business was a separate reportable segment until the sale of the business in 2014 as
discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition

We encounter intense competition from governmental,

quasi-governmental

and private sources in all
aspects of our operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of three national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain
discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. In recent years, the industry has seen some additional
consolidation, though the industry remains intensely competitive. The industry’s national and regional competitors are often significant competitors in local markets. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities
that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs.

Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge are
determined locally, and typically vary by volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the
geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense competition in our Solid Waste business based on pricing and quality of service. We have also begun competing for business based on breadth of
service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of
waste.

Seasonal Trends

Our
operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during
the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.

Service
disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other



Index to Financial Statements

hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern United
States, can increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other unusual event occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such
revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.

Employees

At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 41,200

full-time

employees, of which approximately 7,800
were employed in administrative and sales positions and the balance in operations. Approximately 8,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their
obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits; (ii) supporting

variable-rate

tax-exempt
debt and (iii) estimated final capping, closure,

post-closure

and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills. We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of credit,
insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity.

Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party surety and insurance companies; (ii) an
entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, National Guaranty Insurance Company of Vermont, the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds and/or insurance policies on our
behalf. Letters of credit generally are supported by our

long-term

U.S. revolving credit facility (“$2.25 billion revolving credit facility”) and other credit facilities established for that
purpose.

Insurance

We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers’
compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under
the related insurance policy. As of December 31, 2016, our commercial General Liability Insurance Policy carried self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried
self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31, 2016, our automobile liability insurance program included a per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to an additional deductible of $4.8 million
in the $5 million to $10 million layer. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our
estimated insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2016 are summarized in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability, often referred to as “Broad Form Side A,” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage, often referred
to as “Side B.” The Side A policy covers directors and officers directly for loss, including defense costs, when corporate indemnification is unavailable. Side A-only coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the Company, as the Company
is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers.



Index to Financial Statements

Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws
and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the EPA, Environment Canada, and various other federal, state, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in the United States and
Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.

Because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner, a significant amount of
our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting,
operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and

post-closure

obligations. In connection with our acquisition, development or expansion of a waste
management or disposal facility or transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required
governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital
and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.

In recent years, we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by
regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. However, the new United States presidential administration has called for substantial changes to areas of federal tax and foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in
favor of reducing regulation, including environmental regulation. We cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the United States, the timing of any such changes, or the impact of any
such changes on our business. While reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs, the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our Company. It is likely
that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us.

The primary United States
federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), as amended, regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop
programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991, the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA, which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically
implemented by the states, although states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in the ordinary course of our operations.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
(“CERCLA”) which is also known as Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have created actual or potential environmental hazards.
CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal sites upon current and former site owners and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the site and transporters who selected
the disposal site and transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional release of hazardous substances; it can be based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of lawful, unintentional and
non-negligent action, of hazardous substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable statutes and regulations. The EPA may issue orders requiring responsible parties to perform response actions at sites, or the EPA may seek recovery
of funds expended or to be expended in the future at sites. Liability may include contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a



Index to Financial Statements

defendant in a CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators in an administrative or

judicially-approved

settlement. Liability under CERCLA could also include obligations to a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) that voluntarily expends site clean-up costs. Further, liability for
damage to publicly-owned natural resources may also be imposed. We are subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed and as a generator or transporter of hazardous
substances disposed of at other locations.

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, known as the Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a variety of sources,
including solid and hazardous waste disposal sites. If

run-off

from our operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct
sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards for management of storm water run-off that require landfills and other waste-handling
facilities to obtain storm water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a

publicly-owned

treatment works, the facility must comply with
discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act
provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act,
including large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities. In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and
emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and existing large landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for municipal solid waste landfills subject to the NSPS. These
regulations impose limits on air emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act and, in many instances,
require installation of landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions or to treat and utilize landfill gas on-or

off-site.

The EPA entered into a settlement agreement with the Environmental
Defense Fund to evaluate the 1996 NSPS for new landfills as required by the Clean Air Act every eight years and revise them if deemed necessary. The EPA entered into a consent decree to finalize the NSPS rule in July 2016. On August 29, 2016, the
EPA published two rules with new requirements for landfill gas control at both new municipal solid waste landfills (constructed or modified after July 17, 2014) as well as existing landfills (operating after November 8, 1987 and not modified after
July 17, 2014). The stated intent of the rules was to reduce methane emissions from landfills as part of the federal regulatory efforts to curtail emission of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) to ameliorate the effects of climate change. Working
with our trade associations and other landfill owners and operators, we have identified significant legal, technical and implementation concerns with the rules. Together we have filed administrative petitions asking that the EPA stay the rules and
initiate a rulemaking process to address our concerns, while also filing a petition for judicial review.

Should the EPA or
the court not address our legal and technical concerns in the final rules, we will reassess the capital and operating cost impact to our operations. However, we do not believe that the ultimate regulatory changes would have a material adverse impact
on our business as a whole.

Additionally, emission and fuel economy standards have been imposed on manufacturers of transportation
vehicles (including heavy-duty waste collection vehicles). The EPA and the Department of Transportation finalized Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles — Phase 2 on August 16,
2016. The rule will increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions standards for our collection fleet between model years 2021



Index to Financial Statements

and 2027; however, we expect to be able to purchase fully compliant vehicles that will meet our operational needs. The regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet, but we do not
believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, (“OSHA”) establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or
serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and various reporting and record keeping obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of
hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of hazardous materials
and hazardous waste, including safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

We are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in United States federal regulations affecting our
business:

•

In 2010, the EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V GHG Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs, including
methane and carbon dioxide. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored
thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation.

In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that
significantly limited the applicability and scope of EPA permitting requirements for GHGs from stationary sources, concluding that: the EPA may not treat GHGs as an air pollutant for purposes of determining whether a source is required to obtain a
PSD or Title V permit; and the EPA can continue to require that PSD permits otherwise required based on emissions of conventional pollutants contain limitations on GHG emissions based on Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”).
Following this ruling, the EPA issued a policy memorandum in July 2014 advising that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling effectively narrows the scope of biogenic CO


permitting issues that remain
for the EPA to address. Further, on October 3, 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the PSD and Title V GHG permitting regulations and proposed establishing a significant emissions rate (“SER”) of 75,000 tons of CO


equivalent, below which, sources would not be required to implement additional control technologies for their GHG emissions. This SER threshold should prevent most of our operational changes, such
as landfill expansions and beneficial gas recovery projects, from being subject to PSD or Title V permit requirements due to our GHG emissions – assuming the EPA classifies biogenic CO


emissions as carbon neutral. The EPA has not yet finalized the rulemaking, nor has it addressed how it will exempt biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from waste-derived feedstocks (municipal solid waste and landfill gas) from PSD and Title V air
permitting. The EPA nonetheless anticipates basing this proposal on the rationale that those emissions are likely to have minimal or no net atmospheric contributions, or may even reduce such impacts, when compared to an alternate method of disposal.
These conclusions have been recommended to the EPA by its independent Science Advisory Board. As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling and the EPA policy and proposed regulatory action, we continue to believe the potential impact of the PSD and
Title V GHG Tailoring Rule on our air permits, compliance and results of operations is significantly reduced.

Other recent final and
proposed rules to increase the stringency of certain National Ambient Air Quality Standards, such as the Ozone rule finalized in October 2015, and related PSD increment/significance thresholds could affect the cost, timeliness and availability of
air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In general, controlling emissions involves installing collection wells in a landfill and routing the gas to a suitable



Index to Financial Statements

energy recovery system or combustion device. As of December 31, 2016, we had 131 projects at owned or operated landfills where landfill gas was captured and utilized for its renewable energy
value rather than flared. Efforts to curtail the emission of GHGs and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls, with associated capital or operating costs; however, we do not
believe that such regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

—

The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases”
could increase our costs to operate.

The EPA clarified in its November 19, 2014 policy memorandum that states may rely on
waste-derived biogenic feedstocks in their future proposed compliance plans required by the final Clean Power Plan rules and the proposed federal plan, both published in October 2015, which may create new or expanded opportunities for renewable
energy projects. According to the EPA, the federal plan would fill any gaps pending implementation of State or Tribal plans to achieve required emissions reductions, but would no longer apply when a State or Tribal plan is approved.

We are taking steps to anticipate the future needs of our customers which include investing in and developing ever-more-advanced recycling and
reuse technologies. Potential climate change and GHG regulatory initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide

low-carbon

services to our customers, and we increasingly view our ability to offer
lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth. If the United States were to impose a carbon tax or other form of GHG regulation increasing demand for

low-carbon

service offerings in the
future, the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable.

•

In 2011, the EPA published the Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials (“NHSM”) Rule, which provides the standards and procedures for identifying whether NHSM are solid waste under RCRA when used as fuels or
ingredients in combustion units. The EPA also published New Source Performance Standards and Emission Guidelines for commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units (“CISWI”) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards for
commercial and industrial boilers (“Boiler MACT”). The EPA published clarifications and amendments to the three rules in 2013 and legal challenges to the rules were subsequently filed by both industry and environmental groups. In May 2015,
the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the NHSM Rule together with the amendments to the rule that support some of our projects in which we are seeking to convert biomass or other secondary materials into products, fuels or energy. Through
rulings in July and December of 2016 related to the CISWI and Boiler MACT challenges, the Court vacated certain elements of those rules while remanding other aspects of the rules to the EPA for reconsideration. Because the EPA reconsideration
process is ongoing it is not possible to quantify the financial impact of all these rulemakings at the present time. However, we believe the rules and administrative determinations will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole
and are more likely to facilitate our efforts to reuse or recover energy value from secondary material streams.

•

In December 2014, the EPA issued a final rule regulating the disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion residuals (“CCR”). The regulations encourage beneficial use of CCR in encapsulated uses (e.g., used
in cement or wallboard), and use according to established industry standards (e.g., application of sludge for agricultural enrichment). The EPA also deemed disposal and beneficial use of CCR at permitted municipal solid waste landfills exempt from
the new regulations because the RCRA Subtitle D standards applicable at municipal solid waste landfills provide at least equivalent protection. The new standards are consistent with our approach to handling CCR at our sites currently, and we believe
the new standards will provide a potential growth opportunity for the Company. States may impose standards more stringent than the federal program, and under the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, may receive approval to run
permitting programs for CCR in their states. This codification of the CCR rule provides utilities with a stable regulatory regime.



Index to Financial Statements

State, Provincial and Local Regulations

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations. Each state and province in which we operate has
its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the
design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types
of requirements.

Our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal. Many state and
local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste, and electronics at landfills. The number of state and local governments with recycling
requirements and disposal bans continues to grow, while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging.

Various
states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. While laws that overtly discriminate against

out-of-state

waste
have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or
taxes on the importation of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control”
regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that
was privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions
on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste
management services.

Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or
implemented in many places around the world, including in the United States and Canada. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with
the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal
law establishing EPR in the United States or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could take, and in some cases have taken, steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a
fundamental impact on the waste, recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste
services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the
parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and to
deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness, unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.

Foreign Import and Export Regulations

Enforcement or implementation of foreign and domestic regulations can affect our ability to export products. A significant portion of the fiber
that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe,



Index to Financial Statements

particularly China. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and

non-conforming

materials
that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables. The higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence,” as well as
increased container weight tracking and port fees, have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry. Additionally, the new presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility
of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade. Restrictions and tariffs on exporting would have a significant impact on our recycling operations.

Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of

non-recyclables,

which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. Despite increased costs associated with export requirements, we believe we are well positioned among our potential
competitors to respond to and comply with such regulations. In recent years, we have been revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle
properly.

Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation

Our Energy Services line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and
production operations. There remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of
methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015, as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules
regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. On the other hand, we believe the size,
capital structure, regulatory sophistication and established reliability of our Company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services.

Emissions from Natural Gas Fueling and Infrastructure

We operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. As of December
31, 2016, we were operating 95 natural gas fueling facilities, 28 of which also serve the public or

pre-approved

third parties, in 31 states and three Canadian provinces. Concerns have been raised about the
potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. We have partnered with the environmental organization Environmental Defense Fund, as well as other heavy-duty equipment users and experts,
on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers. We anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavy-duty fleet may ultimately help inform regulations that will affect equipment manufacturers and will define operating
procedures across the industry. Additional regulation of, or restrictions on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. We are not yet able to evaluate potential operating
changes or costs associated with such regulations, but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our future investment in natural gas vehicles.

Federal, State and Local Climate Change Initiatives

In light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change, we have identified a strategic business opportunity
to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions. As part of our on-going marketing evaluations, we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable
carbon reductions, such as waste reduction, increased recycling, and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel.



Index to Financial Statements

We use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider. We are active in
support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints. We understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and actively seek
opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we work with stakeholders at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable,
low-carbon fuels and electricity.

We continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather
events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events. We are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events, which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a
reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors.

In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business, we may make
“forward-looking statements.”

Forward-looking

statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results.

Forward-looking

statements are often identified by the words, “will,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,”
“plan,” “forecast,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend” and words of a similar nature and generally include statements containing:

•

projections about accounting and finances;

•

plans and objectives for the future;

•

projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our performance; or

•

our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or future events, circumstances or performance.

You should view these statements with caution. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. They are
based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. All aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone or taken
together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events,
circumstances or developments. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements
for 2017 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forward-looking statements made by the Company.

The waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition
and operating results may be materially adversely affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental,

quasi-governmental

and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of three national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying
sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy
and other by-products. In recent years, the industry has seen some additional consolidation, though the industry remains intensely competitive. The industry’s national and regional competitors are often significant competitors in local markets.
We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer



Index to Financial Statements

needs. These counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them. Also,
such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage. In addition, some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations, allowing them to reduce their prices to expand
sales volume or to win

competitively-bid

contracts, including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities. When this happens, we may lose customers and be unable to execute
our pricing strategy, resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business.

If we fail to implement our
business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.

Our future financial
performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place
significant demands on those resources. See Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

—

Overview

for more information on our business strategy.

There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following:

•

Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy.

•

We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.

•

A key element of our strategy is yield management through focus on price leadership, which has presented challenges to keep existing business and win new business at reasonable returns. We have also continued our
environmental fee, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee to offset costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases and our unwillingness to pursue lower margin volumes may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations.
Additionally, we have in the past and continue to face purported class action lawsuits related to our customer service agreements, prices and fees.

•

We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result.

•

We may not be able to maintain cost savings achieved through restructuring efforts.

•

Strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

—

We may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to
our assets

.

•

Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on
favorable terms, and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions.

•

Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of
emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others.

•

Integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.

•

Liabilities associated with acquisitions, including ones that may exist only because of past operations of an acquired business, may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than anticipated.

•

Execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial
plans.



Index to Financial Statements

•

We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and

non-strategic

operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses.

In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our
control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our
business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business
strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.

Compliance with existing or
increased future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures, and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry
for our competitors.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial, and local level in the United States and
Canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and
related matters. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

•

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities;

•

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes;

•

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of

out-of-state

waste or certain categories of waste;

•

mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or

•

limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams.

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail
operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other
governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

We also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure,

post-closure

and
environmental remediation at our existing landfills. We establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals because of the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of, including
actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or third-party landfill operators, among other reasons. Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure,

post-closure

and
remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals.

Various states have enacted, or are considering
enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation



Index to Financial Statements

authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of

out-of-state

or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several
state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The United States Congress’ adoption of
legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste certain types of flow control, or courts’
interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.

Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places
around the world, including in the United States and Canada. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding
responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law
establishing EPR in the United States or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental
impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

In recent years, we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the
number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. However, the new United States presidential administration has called for substantial changes to areas of federal tax and foreign
trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation, including environmental regulation. We cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the United States, the
timing of any such changes, or the impact of any such changes on our business. While reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs, the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier
to entry that benefits our Company. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us.

Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. A significant portion of the fiber that we
market is shipped to export markets across the globe, particularly China. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled
paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables. The higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry,
particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of

non-recyclables,

which results in increased processing and
residual disposal costs. Additionally, the new presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade. If Operation
Green Fence or other similar initiatives, such as increased container weight tracking and port fees, new regulations, or restrictions and tariffs on exporting increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs
from our customers, such initiatives regulations, restrictions and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and plastics, which are subject to
significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint, and the price fluctuations for these commodities could be impacted by significant
changes in United States foreign trade policy and increased tariffs on international trade, as Chinese paper mills are the primary consumer of the fiber we market. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our
operating income and cash



Index to Financial Statements

flows positively, as we experienced in 2016, or negatively, as we experienced in 2015 and 2014. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to
commodity price fluctuations. The increase in market prices in 2016 for commodities resulted in a

year-over-year

increase in revenue of $51 million. The decline in market prices in 2015 and 2014 for
commodities resulted in

year-over-year

decreases in revenue of $138 million and $53 million, respectively. Additionally, under some agreements, our recycling
operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers. In some cases, if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for recycling commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may be
subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated. As we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations,
the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall.

Fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business, including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products. Significant
variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations.
Additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our Energy Services business. Demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices,
such as the pronounced price decreases beginning in late 2014 and continuing low prices throughout 2015 and 2016. Any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future.

Changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely affect our Energy Services business.

Energy Services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our
control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. Changes in laws or government regulations regarding GHG emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’ costs of doing business and reduce
oil and gas exploration and production by customers. There remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened federal
regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of oil
and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such
services.

Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our
revenues and operating results to decline.

Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal,
such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types
of waste, such as yard waste, food waste, and electronics at landfills. Where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills.
Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our
landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Our landfills currently provide and, together with our divested

waste-to-energy

facilities, have historically provided our
highest income from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste
entirely, then our revenues and operating results may decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected
due to disposal alternatives.



Index to Financial Statements

Developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management
industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability.

Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities
are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable

by-products.

We and many other companies are investing
in these technologies. It is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. As a
result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives.

If we are not able to
develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer.

Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect, new technologies.
Research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in
the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the
investments required to bring new products and services to market. Further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new
technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. Our Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of
waste. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial
results may suffer.

Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand.

We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our
brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or
not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in
demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our
reputation and restore the value of our brand.

Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations,
as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities.

There is risk of incurring significant
environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the
property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations
involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the
counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us.



Index to Financial Statements

Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such
arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in legal and
administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit
we need; and

•

local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are
subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or
other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well
as material charges for asset impairments.

Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet
certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate
or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant.

General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our
revenues and our income from operations margins.

Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic
factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our
revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows.
In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by
customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase
in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, a prolonged economic downturn in China could significantly impact prices for post-consumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations.

Some of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could
negatively impact our operating results.

We provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which
have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased
rates.

Many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers
of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national
accounts, could negatively affect our operating results.



Index to Financial Statements

In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in
investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had $491 million of

variable-rate

tax-exempt bonds with interest rates reset on either
a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the weakness
in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.

We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease
our revenue and increase our costs.

Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to
obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain.
Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other
political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or
regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding
existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Significant shortages in diesel fuel
supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses.

The price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate
significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil and gas producers,
regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could
substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge
program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, we have recently settled
cases that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices, and we continue to face similar claims. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs,
increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins.

We have an extensive
natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices.

We operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. However, natural
gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in North America; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. It will remain necessary for us
to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions
on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the price



Index to Financial Statements

and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the
benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program.

We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected.

We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third
parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in
implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations.

A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to
litigation risk.

We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social
networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business
involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic
information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions
and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If
we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber
incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with
our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential litigation and liability
and competitive disadvantage.

Our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in
regulations related to labor unions.

Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely
continue in the future. Certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and,
if successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our
operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans.

We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (“Multiemployer Pension
Plans”) for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In



Index to Financial Statements

the event of our withdrawal from a Multiemployer Pension Plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on
various factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded Multiemployer Pension
Plans, and we recognized related expenses of $51 million in 2015 and $4 million in 2014. See Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans.

Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others.

Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as truck accidents,
equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. Additionally, we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability, releases of hazardous materials, and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters.
There may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. We also build and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of
which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. Any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees
and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction.

While we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as
vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also
tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense.

We have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities.

The
amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are
generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other
insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments
in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we
estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations
with respect to

variable-rate

tax-exempt

debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or
surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position,
which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the
types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party



Index to Financial Statements

insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. It is possible that
we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital
resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.

We may record material charges against our
earnings due to impairments to our assets.

In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we capitalize certain
expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to,
shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could
warrant asset impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized
costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of
certain triggering events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations.

Our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our
growth and development plans, or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile.

If economic conditions or other
risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share
repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may
need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our
financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of
other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third-party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would
increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected.

Additionally, we have $1.6 billion of
debt as of December 31, 2016 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and
Canadian term loan. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow.

We may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our C$50 million Canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash
needs, to the extent available, until maturity in July 2020 and March 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had $426 million of outstanding borrowings and $789 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the
$2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving unused and available credit capacity of $1,035 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the Canadian revolving credit facility. In the event of a default under our credit
facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do.



Index to Financial Statements

Additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would
have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.

The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations
restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate.

Our landfill operations emit methane,
identified as a GHG. There are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change
legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our

lower-carbon

service options, the materiality of which we cannot
predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG
emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation.
However, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs.

The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior
performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer
months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter
revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.

Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods
of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the
year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern United States, can increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other unusual event occurrences can boost revenues through
additional work for a limited time, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.

For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year,
and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results.

We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third
parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with United States or foreign laws or regulations.

Some of our
projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and with applicable local
laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local
partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.



Index to Financial Statements

Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material
adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.

From time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating
to the conduct of our business. We are also party to civil litigation. As a large company with operations across the United States and Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our
business. Actions that have been filed against us, and that may be filed against us in the future, include personal injury, property damage, commercial, customer, and

employment-related

claims, including
purported state and national class action lawsuits related to:

•

alleged environmental contamination, including releases of hazardous materials and odors;

•

sales and marketing practices, customer service agreements, prices and fees; and

•

federal and state wage and hour and other laws.

The timing of the final resolutions to these
types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.

We may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and
interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we occupy approximately 366,000 square
feet under leases expiring through 2020. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Illinois, Connecticut and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations in all
50 states, the District of Columbia and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily landfills and
other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our operating properties, vehicles and equipment are adequately maintained and sufficient for our current
operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional property and equipment for expansion, for replacement of assets and in connection with our strategic growth plans. For more information, see Item 7.

Our quarterly dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were
$726 million in 2016, or $1.64 per common share, $695 million in 2015, or $1.54 per common share, and $693 million in 2014, or $1.50 per common share.

In December 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.41 to $0.425 per share for
dividends declared in 2017. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other
factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Our share repurchases have also been made in accordance with plans approved by our
Board of Directors. We announced in December 2015 that the Board of Directors authorized up to $1 billion in future share repurchases. During 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of $725 million of our common stock under accelerated share
repurchase (“ASR”) agreements, of which $150 million was repurchased pursuant to the Board of Directors authorization granted in February 2015. We received a total of 11.2 million shares pursuant to these ASR agreements with a
weighted average per share purchase price of $60.49. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In November 2016, the Company entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase $225 million of our common stock. At the beginning of the repurchase period, we delivered $225 million in cash and received
2.8 million shares based on a stock price of $63.41 per share. The ASR agreement completed in February 2017, at which time we received 0.4 million additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the
repurchase period of $69.43.

(b)

We announced in December 2016 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $750 million in future share repurchases, which supersedes and replaces remaining authority under any prior Board of Directors
authorization for share repurchases.

Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will
depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2016. This discussion may contain
forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

. The following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

Our
Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming
more complex, and our aim is to address the current needs, while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs, of our customers. We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste
management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by
delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive.

Our fundamental strategy has not changed; we remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our
core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement, with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions, the regulatory environment, asset and resource availability and current technology. We believe that
focused differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets, will deliver profitable growth and competitive advantages. Simultaneously, we believe the combination of cost control, process
improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the Company’s strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies
that may generate additional value and related market dynamics, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as our recycling operations.

We believe that execution of our strategy will deliver shareholder value and leadership in a dynamic industry.

Notable items of our 2016 financial results include:

•

Revenues of $13,609 million in 2016 compared with $12,961 million in 2015, an increase of $648 million. This increase in revenues is primarily attributable to (i) the combined impact of yield and
volume growth, which contributed $437 million of additional revenues, primarily in our collection and disposal and recycling operations and (ii) acquisitions, net of divestitures, which contributed $238 million of revenue growth,
primarily due to the acquisition of certain operations and business assets of SWS in January 2016. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation related to our Canadian operations;

•

Operating expenses of $8,486 million in 2016, or 62.4% of revenues, compared with $8,231 million, or 63.5% of revenues, in 2015. This increase of $255 million is primarily attributable to
(i) incremental costs attributable to acquired businesses, net of divestitures, of approximately $143 million; (ii) increased landfill operating costs of $97 million, primarily landfill leachate management costs;
(iii) increased cost of goods sold of $60 million, primarily related to higher recycling commodity prices and (iv) costs associated with higher volumes, estimated at $60 million. These increases were partially offset by lower
fuel costs of $66 million, primarily due to lower

year-over-year

average fuel prices;

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,410 million in 2016, compared with $1,343 million in
2015, or 10.4% of revenues for both periods. This increase of $67 million is primarily attributable to higher labor and related benefits of $94 million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation



Index to Financial Statements

costs, merit increases and higher severance costs. These increases were partially offset by reduced legal fees, lower bank charges and favorable litigation settlements;

•

Income from operations of $2,296 million, or 16.9% of revenues, in 2016 compared with $2,045 million, or 15.8% of revenues, in 2015, an increase of $251 million. In addition to the items discussed above,
the comparability was also affected by asset impairments and unusual items in both periods, as discussed below;

•

Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $1,182 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, for 2016, as compared with $753 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, for 2015. The increase was primarily driven
by the earnings growth of our core operations discussed above as well as the 2015 loss on early extinguishment of debt discussed below; and

•

In 2016, we returned $1,451 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared with $1,295 million in 2015.

The Company had a very successful 2016, exceeding expectations and carrying forward our momentum from 2015 by generating strong earnings and
cash flow. Our commitment to executing on our strategies of disciplined profitable volume growth and controlling costs, through focused differentiation and continuous improvement, drove these impressive results in 2016 and have built a strong
foundation to produce solid earnings and generate further growth in 2017. This growth, combined with our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet, supports the Company’s continued focus on investing in our business, paying dividends,
pursuing attractive opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions and considering the market for share repurchases.

The
following explanations of certain items that affected the comparability of the years presented has been provided to support investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2016 results were affected by the following:

•

The recognition of

pre-tax

charges aggregating to $151 million, primarily related to (i) a $43 million impairment charge due to a loss of expected volumes for a
landfill; (ii) a $42 million charge to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in Harris County, Texas; (iii) $41 million of impairment charges related to

minority-owned,

cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies; (iv) a $10 million goodwill impairment charge related to our
LampTracker

®

reporting unit and (v) an $8 million loss on the sale of a

majority-owned

organics company. These charges had a negative impact
of $0.26 on our diluted earnings per share.

Our 2015 results were affected by the following:

•

The recognition of a

pre-tax

loss of $555 million, primarily related to the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through

make-whole

redemption and cash tender offers. These charges had a negative impact of $0.75 on our diluted earnings per share;

•

Pre-tax

charges of $51 million associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per
share; and

•

Net

pre-tax

charges of $102 million resulting from impairments, restructuring and divestitures, of which $66 million related to the impairment of our oil and gas
producing properties. These items had a negative impact of $0.14 on our diluted earnings per share.

Free Cash Flow

As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use
this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested).
We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of



Index to Financial Statements

refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However,
we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we
have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements.

Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation
to “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies:

When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the comparable
period in 2015, the increase of $462 million is primarily related to (i) higher earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business; (ii) cash proceeds of $67 million from the termination of our

cross-currency

swaps in the first quarter of 2016; (iii)

trustee-managed

multiemployer defined benefit pension plan (“Multiemployer Pension Plan”) settlement
payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iv) lower annual incentive plan cash payments of $46 million in the current year; partially offset, by higher income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with
equity-based transactions, of $36 million in the current year. Additionally, we experienced net favorable changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including
payroll and incentive accruals.

When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 2014, the
increase of $167 million is primarily related to (i) lower income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with

equity-based

transactions, of $329 million in 2015; (ii) lower interest
paid of $77 million in 2015 and (iii) the settlement of forward-starting swap liabilities of $36 million in 2014. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in cash earnings due to the sale of our Wheelabrator
business in 2014; (ii) Multiemployer Pension Plan settlement payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iii) higher

year-over-year

annual incentive
plan payments of approximately $65 million in 2015. Finally, we experienced net unfavorable changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and
incentive accruals.

Capital expenditures increased by $106 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and by $82 million in 2015 compared
to 2014. The increase in our capital expenditures in both years is generally the result of additional spending on new business opportunities and acquisitions, growth in our existing business and asset replacement timing. In addition, the
construction of a waste-water treatment facility at one of our landfills also contributed to the increase in 2016. Although we experienced capital expenditure increases in both 2016 and 2015, the Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on
capital management.

The significantly higher proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) for the
year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is largely driven by the 2014 sales of (i) our Wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion; (ii) our investment in Shanghai Environment Group, which was
part of our Wheelabrator business, for $155 million and (iii) our Puerto Rico operations for consideration of $80 million, including $65 million in cash.

Acquisitions

Southern Waste Systems

/Sun Recyclin

g

(“SWS”)

— On January 8, 2016, Waste Management Inc. of Florida, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, acquired certain operations and business assets of SWS in Southern Florida for total consideration of $525 million. The acquired business assets include residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste
collection, processing/recycling and transfer operations, equipment, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements.

Deffenbaugh
Disposal, Inc. (“Deffenbaugh”)

— On March 26, 2015, we acquired Deffenbaugh, one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest, for total consideration, net of cash acquired, of $400 million.
Deffenbaugh’s assets include collection operations, transfer stations, recycling facilities and landfills.

Divestitures

Wheelabrator Business

— On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital
Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale, which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures,
asset impairments and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net adjustments to this gain were immaterial on a pre-tax basis. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into
several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these agreements.

Other —

In addition to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, we also divested our Puerto Rico operations, as well as
certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in 2014.

In total, these divested businesses and assets provided
$0.18 of diluted earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Debt Issuance Costs

— In April 2015, and as subsequently amended, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued amended authoritative guidance associated with debt issuance costs which were previously presented as assets related to recognized debt liabilities. The amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs, other than those costs related to
line of credit arrangements, be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, which is similar to the presentation for debt discounts and premiums. This guidance was effective for the Company on January 1,
2016. The Company’s adoption of this guidance was applied retrospectively and resulted in a reclassification of $52 million of such costs in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.

Consolidation —

In February 2015, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with consolidation. The amended
guidance makes changes to existing consolidation requirements associated with the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities, including limited partnerships and variable
interest entities. The guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure
of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be
calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the
greatest amount of uncertainty



Index to Financial Statements

relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities,

long-lived

asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated
with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.

Landfills

Accounting for
landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement
obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping
event.

Landfill Costs

— We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and
expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and
landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill
buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts
previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs.

Final Capping Costs

— We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials
and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. The
landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs
annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to
a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income
prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Closure and

Post-Closure

Costs

— We base our estimates for closure and

post-closure

costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and

post-closure

monitoring
and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the
forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in
estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is
recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our
engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to
compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.

Expansion Airspace

— We also include
currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an



Index to Financial Statements

expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we
must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and

•

Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must
meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy
provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and
circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a

landfill-specific

review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review
by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 16 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2016, three landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace
because the permit application process did not meet the one- or five-year requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our
calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and

post-closure

of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.

Once the remaining
permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density
obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial
and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial
selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent

multi-level

review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally
indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will
be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets
related to closure and

post-closure

activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such
estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to



Index to Financial Statements

higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be
considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort,
the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may
have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and
certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a
number of estimates and assumptions.

Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate
sites based on

site-specific

facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the
amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then
either developed using our internal resources or by

third-party

environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.

Long-Lived Asset Impairments

We assess our

long-lived

assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards.
If necessary, impairments are recorded in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Property and Equipment, including Landfills and

Definite-Lived

Intangible Assets —

We
monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator
occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will
determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair
value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations
and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less



Index to Financial Statements

than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Estimating future cash flows
requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.

The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion
projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny
the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to
cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of
all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a

probability-weighted

cash flow
estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. See Item 7.

— Expansion Airspace

above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit.

Goodwill

— At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using
Level 3 inputs.

We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative
assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we
determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment.

If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or

two-step

impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The
first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an
indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is
based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows
and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions
that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of

publicly-traded

companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of
their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using
valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.

Fair value is computed
using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our
judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable.

and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods.

Indefinite-Lived

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill

— At least annually, and more
frequently if warranted, we assess

indefinite-lived

intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment.

When performing the impairment test for

indefinite-lived

intangible assets, we generally first conduct
a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value
of the asset to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value.

Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We
discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe this approach is
appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected

long-term

performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business.

Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash
flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of these
assets is reasonable.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income
tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a
valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable
items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances
change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Should interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of provision for
income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Insured and

Self-Insured

Claims

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’
compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if
future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Results of Operations

Operating
Revenues

Our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal,
and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling



Index to Financial Statements

and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or
weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at
our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenues
generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs
for diesel fuel. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, including both our Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”) and Energy and Environmental Services organizations, recycling brokerage
services, landfill gas-to-energy services and expanded service offerings and solutions. We also offer portable

self-storage

and long distance moving services; fluorescent bulb and universal waste

;
and street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below. Our Wheelabrator business, divested in December 2014, provides
waste-to-energy services and manages

(i)

Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s related business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year.

Our revenues increased $648 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year, driven by
(i) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016; (ii) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations; (iii) higher volumes and (iv) higher market prices for the recycling commodities we
sell. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were (i) lower revenues from our fuel surcharges program due to lower year-over-year diesel fuel prices; (ii) divestitures and (iii) foreign currency translation which affects
revenues from our Canadian operations.

Our revenues decreased $1,035 million, or 7.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as
compared to the prior year, driven by (i) divestitures in 2014, principally our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area; (ii) lower volumes;
(iii) lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to declining diesel fuel prices; (iv) lower market prices for the recycling commodities we sell and (v) foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these revenue declines
were

(i) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations and (ii) revenue from acquired operations, primarily the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh in March 2015.

The following provides further details about our period-to-period change in revenues:

Average yield

Collection and disposal average yield

— This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our
collection, transfer and landfill operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average
price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers.

Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $267 million, or 2.4%, and $203 million, or 1.8%, for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We experienced growth in yield for all of our collection and disposal lines of business in both 2016 and 2015. The details are as follows (dollars in millions):

Revenues from our environmental fee contributed $72 million and $17 million for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to our collection and disposal average yield.

Recycling commodities

— Our revenues
increased $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year period due to a 7%

year-over-year

increase in the market prices for the
recycling commodities we sell at our recycling facilities and through our recycling brokerage services. During 2015, revenues declined by $138 million as compared with the prior year due to a 12%

year-over-year

decline in recycling commodities prices.

Fuel surcharges and mandated fees
—

These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, decreased $67 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These revenues fluctuate in response to
changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. Market prices for diesel fuel decreased approximately 14% in 2016 and 30% in 2015, which caused the decline in fuel surcharge revenues in 2016 and 2015. The
mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These fees did not have a significant impact on
the comparability of the periods presented.



Index to Financial Statements

Volume

Our revenues increased $186 million, or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year due to higher volumes.
The year-over-year comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions, as discussed below. We experienced higher volumes in all of our collection and disposal lines of business, with the exception of our residential line of business, as a result
of (i) improving market conditions; (ii) reduced customer churn and improved sales performance supported by our focus on disciplined growth and (iii) an additional workday in 2016.

Additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2016 to 2015 are as follows:

•

Due to our focus on renegotiating existing contracts and winning new contracts with reasonable returns, we continue to see revenue declines in our residential line of business; and

•

In our ancillary service businesses, we experienced higher volumes in 2016 as compared with the prior year resulting from our Energy and Environmental Services organization, particularly our remediation and construction
services, WM Renewable Energy and our portable

self-storage

businesses. These volume increases were partially offset by lower volumes resulting from lower oil prices, which negatively affected both our oil and
gas producing properties and our oilfield services business.

Declines in our volumes caused our revenue to decrease
$215 million, or 1.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with the prior year. We experienced lower volumes in (i) our collection line of business, primarily due to competition and our pricing strategies; (ii) our MRFs,
primarily driven by the rationalization of our underperforming assets and our strategy to not renew municipal contracts that did not reflect current market conditions and (iii) our ancillary services businesses, primarily due to the loss of
certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization and lower oil prices, which negatively affected both our oil and gas producing properties and our oilfield services business. These decreases in volumes were partially offset by increases in the
municipal solid waste business driven by new business and improving market conditions that favorably affected our landfill and transfer lines of business.

Acquisitions and divestitures

Revenues increased $268 million and $174 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared with the
prior year periods, due to acquisitions. The increase in revenues in 2016 was principally due to the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016. The revenue increase in 2015 was principally due to the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh in March
2015.

These revenues were offset by revenue decreases of $30 million and $762 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, due to divestitures. The decrease in revenues in 2015 was primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014 of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and
collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs
discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party
disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste
collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling business, including rebates paid
to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host
community fees, contingent landfill



Index to Financial Statements

lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental
remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability,
workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies.

Our operating expenses increased $255 million, or 3.1%, when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased $771 million, or 8.6%, when
comparing 2015 with 2014. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 62.4% in 2016, 63.5% in 2015, and 64.3% in 2014.

Significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between periods reported include:

Labor and related benefits

— The increase in labor and related benefits in 2016 as compared with 2015 was due to (i) higher
wages due to merit increases; (ii) additional costs associated with the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016; (iii) health and welfare cost increases; (iv) an additional workday in 2016 and (v) higher incentive compensation
costs. These cost increases were partially offset by (i) $51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans and (ii) lower headcount and contract labor costs in 2016 due to
operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business.

The decrease in labor and related benefits in 2015 as compared with 2014 was
due to (i) reduced costs of $88 million due to the divestitures in 2014 of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area; (ii) lower headcount and
contract labor costs due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business and lower volumes in our collection line of business and (iii) lower health and welfare costs. These cost decreases were partially offset by (i)
$51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans; (ii) higher wages due to merit increases and (iii) additional costs associated with the acquired operations of
Deffenbaugh in March 2015.

Transfer and disposal costs —

The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2016 compared to 2015
was driven by acquisitions, primarily SWS, and our overall increase in volumes. The increase in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to incurring third-party costs for services previously provided on an intercompany basis prior to the
divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. These cost increases were partially offset by $53 million in reduced costs due to the divestitures in 2014.



Index to Financial Statements

Maintenance and repairs

— The increase in maintenance and repairs in 2016 compared to
2015 was primarily driven by (i) higher labor and parts and supplies costs and (ii) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of SWS. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was largely driven by a $177 million decrease
due to the divestitures in 2014, which was partially offset by increased costs related to the acquired operations of Deffenbaugh.

Subcontractor costs

— The increase in subcontractor cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by (i) acquisitions and
(ii) higher volumes in our WMSBS organization. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by
(i) volume decreases in our WMSBS organization and (ii) lower landfill and recycling costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers.

Cost of goods sold —

The increase in cost of goods sold in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to (i) higher market prices for
recycling commodities and (ii) increased costs in our remediation services business, partially offset by lower costs due to continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was
due to (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities; (ii) lower costs of $81 million due to the 2014 divestitures; (iii) increased efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and (iv) ongoing recycling
business improvement efforts around inbound quality control.

Fuel —

The decrease in fuel costs in 2016 and 2015 when compared
to the prior year periods was driven by (i) lower fuel prices; (ii) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles;

(iii) year-over-year

increases in natural gas fuel excise credits and (iv) reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet. The
increase in collection volumes in 2016 partially offset these decreases.

Disposal and franchise fees and taxes —

The increase
in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to (i) higher landfill volumes and (ii) increased municipal franchise fees and subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers. The decrease when
comparing 2015 to 2014 is primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014.

Landfill operating costs —

The increase in landfill
operating costs when comparing 2016 to 2015 is primarily due to higher leachate management costs. Leachate management costs have increased because, in certain parts of the country, we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment
facilities, the third-party fees charged for treatment of waste water have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased.

Higher leachate transportation and disposal costs also affected the comparison of our landfill operating costs for 2015 and 2014, though the
increased costs were more than offset by the impact of 2014 divestitures and discount rate adjustments. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we record adjustments to our landfill operating costs for changes in U.S.
Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets.

Risk management
—

The decrease in costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a reduction in certain uninsured losses and, to a lesser extent, decreased workers’ compensation claims.

Other —

The decrease in costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily related to lower rental costs and favorable adjustments to
our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions. The decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was principally driven by a decrease of $63 million due to the divestitures in 2014.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits which include salaries, bonuses, related
insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation;



Index to Financial Statements

(ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts
and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs,

facility-related

expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges,
computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $67 million, or 5.0%, when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased
$138 million, or 9.3%, when comparing 2015 with 2014. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.4% in 2016, 10.4% in 2015 and 10.6% in 2014.

Significant factors affecting our expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 include:

Labor and related benefits

— The increase in labor and related benefits was primarily due to (i) higher incentive
compensation costs; (ii) merit increases; (iii) higher severance costs and (iv) acquisitions.

Professional fees

— The decrease in professional fees was primarily due to lower legal fees.

Other

— The decrease in other expenses
was principally driven by favorable litigation settlements and lower bank charges.

The divestitures in 2014, primarily the sale of our
Wheelabrator business in December 2014, favorably affected all cost categories when comparing expenses in 2015 to 2014. In addition to the impact of divestitures, other significant factors affecting our expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 include:

Labor and related benefits

— The decrease in labor and related benefits was due to (i) cost savings from our August 2014
reorganization and (ii) lower incentive compensation costs, which were partially offset by merit increases.

Other

— The
decrease in other expenses was principally driven by lower litigation settlement costs and our continued focus on controlling costs.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses include (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases,
on a

straight-line

basis from three to 40 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement
costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a

units-of-consumption

method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site,
which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our

Company-specific

criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final
capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is



Index to Financial Statements

consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach
or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset.

The increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets during
2016 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the acquired operations of SWS in January 2016. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2016 as compared to the prior year is due to increased volumes at our landfills,
partially offset by changes in our landfill estimates.

The decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2015 as
compared to the prior year is primarily due to the December 2014 sale of our Wheelabrator business as discussed further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2015 as compared to
the prior year is primarily due to increased volumes, a portion of which relates to the acquisition of Deffenbaugh in March 2015. This increase was partially offset by favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates.

Restructuring Costs

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $2 million was related
to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $15 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $10 million was
related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with the loss of a municipal contract in our Eastern Canada Area and our acquisition of Deffenbaugh. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease
obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

In August 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several
Corporate functions to better support achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, including cost reduction. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations. Approximately 650 employees
separated from our Corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $70 million was
related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net charges of $82 million, primarily related to (i) $66 million of charges
to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties as a result of the continued decline in oil and gas prices; (ii) $18 million of charges to write down or divest certain assets in our recycling operations and (iii) a
$5 million impairment of a landfill in our Western Canada Area due to revised

post-closure

cost estimates. Partially offsetting these charges was $7 million in net gains from divestitures, including
a $6 million gain on the sale of an oil and gas producing property in 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we
recognized net gains of $160 million, primarily related to the following:

•

Divestitures

— We recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of certain
landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information related to our divestitures.

•

Oil and gas producing properties impairments

— We recognized $272 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties, primarily as a result of the pronounced decrease in oil
and gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2014.

•

Goodwill impairments

— We recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our recycling reporting unit.

•

Other impairments

— We recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations.

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and
analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments.

Solid Waste —

The most significant items affecting the results
of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2016 are summarized below:

•

Our Traditional Solid Waste business benefited from internal revenue growth; and

•

We recognized $51 million of charges associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans in 2015 impacting all three tiers.

In addition, the following items affected the comparability of 2016 to 2015:

•

Our recycling business was favorable in 2016 compared to 2015 principally due to (i) continued cost reductions; (ii) higher market prices for recycling commodities and (iii) the impairment of various
recycling assets in 2015;

•

Increased leachate management costs in Tier 2 in 2016;

•

Higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to merit increases, higher incentive compensation costs and increases in health and welfare costs; and

•

The impairment of a landfill in Tier 2 in 2016 due to a loss of expected volumes.

In
addition, the following items affected the comparability of 2015 to 2014:

•

The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on the results of our Canadian operations in Tiers 1 and 2 in 2015;

•

The unfavorable impact on our oilfield services business, primarily in Tier 2, of reduced drilling and auxiliary activities as a result of declining oil and gas prices in 2015;

•

The transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment to this segment in 2015; and

•

Our recycling business was unfavorable in 2015 compared to 2014 principally due to (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) the impairment of various recycling assets in 2015. These
unfavorable amounts were partially offset by continued cost reductions.



Index to Financial Statements

Other

— Our “Other” income from operations includes (i) our WMSBS
organization; (ii) those elements of our landfill

gas-to-energy

operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Energy and
Environmental Services and WM Renewable Energy organizations that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (iii) our recycling brokerage services and (iv) our expanded service offerings and solutions, such as
portable

self-storage

and long distance moving services, fluorescent lamp recycling, and interests we hold in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations
reflects the results of

non-operating

entities that provide financial assurance and

self-insurance

support for our Solid Waste business.

The following items affected comparability of 2016 to 2015:

•

A $66 million charge related to impairments of oil and gas producing properties recognized in 2015;

•

Our energy related businesses’ results were higher in 2016 principally driven by an increase in remediation services costs to industrial customers in 2015;

•

Increased WMSBS costs, driven in part by the transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment to this segment in 2016; and

•

Increased expenses in 2016 from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items related to a loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company and goodwill impairments, primarily related to our LampTracker

®

reporting unit.

The following items affected comparability of 2015 to
2014:

•

Net charges of $66 million and $339 million primarily related to impairments of oil and gas producing properties recognized in 2015 and 2014, respectively;

•

Our energy related businesses’ results were lower in 2015 principally driven by an increase in remediation services costs to industrial customers in 2015; and

•

The transfer of certain sales employees from our Corporate and Other segment to this segment in 2015.

Corporate and Other

The
following items affected comparability of 2016 to 2015:

•

Higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to higher incentive compensation costs, severance costs, health and welfare costs and merit increases;

•

An increase in a subsidiary’s estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in Harris County, Texas in 2016;

•

Decreased risk management costs in 2016; and

•

The transfer of certain sales employees to our Other segment from this segment in 2016.

The
following items affected comparability of 2015 to 2014:

•

Restructuring costs related to our August 2014 reorganization and subsequent benefits resulting from our restructuring efforts;

•

Lower health and welfare costs in 2015 primarily driven by lower claims and reduced headcount;

•

The transfer of certain sales employees to our Solid Waste and Other segments from this segment in 2015;

•

Continued focus on controlling costs resulting in lower professional fees, telecommunications, contract labor, and travel and entertainment in 2015;



Index to Financial Statements

•

Charges for the settlement of a legal dispute and related fees in 2014;

•

Unfavorable adjustments in 2014 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets to present value; and

•

Increased risk management costs in 2015 primarily related to certain higher than anticipated general liability claim settlements and a favorable risk management allocation in 2014.

Wheelabrator —

The most significant item affecting the results of operations of our Wheelabrator business in 2014 was a
$519 million gain on sale of this business in December 2014.

Interest Expense, net

Our interest expense, net was $376 million in 2016, $385 million in 2015 and $466 million in 2014. During 2016, the decrease in
interest expense was primarily attributable to the impacts of lower market interest rates on certain of our tax-exempt bonds, partially offset by increased borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. During 2015, the decrease
in interest expense was primarily attributable to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes. As a result of the combination of make-whole redemptions of certain senior notes, cash tender offers to purchase certain
senior notes and the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1%.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $555 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount for 2015 was
primarily associated with the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through

make-whole

redemption and cash tender offers. We replaced substantially all of the debt
extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon interest rates and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations. The “Loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our Consolidated Statement of
Operations for 2015 includes $122 million of charges related to

make-whole

redemptions and $430 million of charges related to cash tender offers.

Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities

We recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $44 million, $38 million and $53 million in 2016, 2015 and
2014, respectively. These losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage

low-income

housing properties and a refined coal facility. The tax impacts
realized as a result of our investments in

low-income

housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in

Provision for Income Taxes.

Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. The amount in 2014 includes charges of $11 million primarily to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value.

Other, net

We
recognized other, net expense of $50 million, $7 million and $29 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were impacted by impairment charges of $42 million, $5 million and
$22 million, respectively, related to

other-than-temporary

declines in the value of minority-owned, cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies.
In addition, we recognized $8 million of expense during the first quarter of 2016 associated with the termination of our

cross-currency

swaps, which is discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded provisions for income taxes of $642 million, $308 million and $413 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
These tax provisions resulted in effective income tax rates of 35.2%, 29.1% and 23.6% for the



Index to Financial Statements

years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is primarily affected by (i) variations in
our income before income taxes, as discussed above; (ii) federal tax credits; (iii) tax audit settlements; (iv) the realization of state net operating losses and credits; (v) adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes
and (vi) the tax implications of impairments and divestitures. The impacts of these items are summarized below:

•

Investments Qualifying for Federal Tax Credits

— Our

low-income

housing properties and refined coal facility investments reduced our provision for income taxes
by $55 million, $57 million and $58 million, primarily as a result of the tax credits realized from these investments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information related to these investments.

•

Other Federal Tax Credits

— During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized federal tax credits in addition to the tax credits realized from our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal
facility, resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $14 million, $15 million and $13 million, respectively.

•

Tax Audit Settlements

— The settlement of various tax audits resulted in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $11 million, $10 million and $12 million for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•

State Net Operating Losses and Credits

— During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized state net operating losses and credits resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $10 million,
$17 million and $16 million, respectively.

•

Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes

– Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns and changes in state laws resulted in a
reduction of $10 million, $18 million and $24 million to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•

Tax Implications of Impairments

— A portion of the impairment charges recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 are not deductible for tax purposes. Had the charges been fully deductible, our provision for income
taxes would have been reduced by $15 million, $2 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our
impairment charges.

•

Tax Implications of Divestitures

— During 2014, the Company recorded a net gain of $515 million primarily related to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain
landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $138 million. During 2015, the Company recorded an additional $10 million net gain
primarily related to

post-closing

adjustments on the Wheelabrator divestiture and had this gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $4 million. During 2016, the
Company recorded a loss of $9 million related to the divestiture of certain assets and had the associated tax loss been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have decreased by $5 million. Refer to Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our divestitures.

Based on current tax laws and
regulations, we expect our 2017 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5% based on projected income before income taxes, federal tax credits and other permanent items.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million in 2016 and $1 million in 2015 and net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests was $40 million in 2014. The income for 2014 was principally related to third-parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies (“LLCs”) that owned three

waste-to-



Index to Financial Statements

energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator business. In December 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs from the third parties. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as
part of the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business. Refer to Notes 19 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities,
respectively.

Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis

We owned or operated 243 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2016 and 244 solid waste and five secure
hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2015. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the years ended December 31 and remaining capacity, measured in cubic yards of waste, at

(b)

We received expansion permits at 13 of our landfills during 2016 and six of our landfills during 2015, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal
capacity of our existing landfills.

(c)

Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed
in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and

site-specific

factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to
moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit;
optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training.

These amounts include 1.2 million tons at both December 31, 2016 and 2015, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to
other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects.

When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the
management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2016, our closed sites management group managed 213 closed landfills.

Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2016 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill
life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each
of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are
seeking expansion permits at 16 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills

section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will
be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 47 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume.

The number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2016, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining
permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:

Of the 248 landfills, 200 are owned, 35 are operated under lease agreements and the remaining 13 are operated under other contractual agreements. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and

post-closure

obligations of these landfills.



Index to Financial Statements

As of December 31, 2016, we have 15 landfills which are not currently accepting waste. We
performed tests of recoverability for eight of these landfills and during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $43 million charge to impair one of these landfills in Western Pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes. For the
other seven landfills, with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of $281 million, the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our

probability-weighted

estimation
approach exceeded the carrying values. We did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining seven landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was immaterial.

Landfill Assets

— We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include
expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring
equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs
associated with landfill final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities, which are discussed further below.

The changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 are

As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2017, and
approximately $900 million in 2018 and 2019 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due
to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations.

Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement
obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting
for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or
for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably
estimated.

(a)

Leachate management costs have increased because, in certain parts of the country, we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment facilities, the third-party fees charged for treatment of waste water
have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased.

Amortization of Landfill Airspace

—
Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following:

•

the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our
landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and

•

the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and

post-closure

obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and
capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs.

Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption
basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure
and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping
asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a

per-ton

basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly,
each landfill has multiple

per-ton

amortization rates.

The following table presents our landfill
airspace amortization expense on a

per-ton

basis for the years ended December 31:

$

$

3.96



Index to Financial Statements

Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 248 landfills, and

per-ton

amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill
development and landfill final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill
airspace amortization expense measured on a

per-ton

basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We
continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business
conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills;
(ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations;
(v) final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt, payment of interest and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital expenditures,
acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program.

We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall
financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of
December 31, 2016 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in our outstanding debt balances from
December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to (i) net debt borrowings of $375 million and (ii) the impacts of other

non-cash

changes in our debt balances due to hedge
accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, discounts, premiums and deferred loan costs.

As of December 31, 2016,
the current portion of our

long-term

debt balance of $417 million includes (i) $230 million of short-term borrowings under our long-term $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and (ii)



Index to Financial Statements

$187 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $126 million of tax-exempt bonds.

As of December 31, 2016, we have classified $196 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility
as long-term because we intend and have the ability to refinance or maintain these borrowings on a long-term basis. We generally use available cash to repay borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and any
remaining balances are maintained by extending the maturities of the borrowings. Our current projections indicate that we will maintain $196 million of the $426 million of borrowings outstanding for the next 12 months. The remaining
$230 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility is classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2016, we also have $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12
months and an additional $491 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit. The interest rates on our variable-rate

tax-exempt

bonds are generally reset on either a
daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed Company bonds with investors at

market-driven

rates and we currently expect future
remarketings to be successful. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the intent and ability to use availability under our
$2.25 billion revolving credit facility to fund the debt obligations until they can be remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we classified these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016.

We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding
letters of credit, categorized by type of facility at December 31 (in millions):

of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,035 million.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

— The most significant items affecting the comparison of
our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 are summarized below:

•

Increase in earnings —

Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization and asset
impairments and unusual items, increased by $337 million on a

year-over-year

basis, principally driven



Index to Financial Statements

by earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business. Our 2015 results included $51 million of charges associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans,
of which payments of approximately $60 million were made in 2015.

•

Cross-currency swaps

— During the first quarter of 2016, we terminated our cross-currency swaps associated with the anticipated cash flows of intercompany loans between WM Holdings and its wholly-owned
Canadian subsidiaries, as discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the termination, we received cash proceeds of $67 million, which were classified as a change in “Other current assets”
and “Other assets.”

•

Decrease in annual incentive plan cash payments —

Payments for our annual incentive plans are typically made in the first quarter of the year based on prior year performance. Our cash flow from operating
activities was favorably impacted by $46 million on a

year-over-year

basis, as the annual incentive cash payments made in 2016 were lower than the cash payments
made in 2015.

•

Increase in income tax payments

— Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was $36 million higher on a year-over-year basis largely driven by
higher pre-tax earnings in the current year.

•

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures —

Our cash flows from operating activities were favorably impacted on a

year-over-year

basis due to net changes in our assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2015 as compared with 2014 are summarized below:

•

Increased earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business —

In 2015, we saw an increase in earnings from our Traditional Solid Waste business, which was enhanced by acquisitions and corporate overhead
cost reductions. These cash flow improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in earnings from our recycling operations.

•

Cash flow of divested businesses

— The divestiture of Wheelabrator in December 2014 coupled with the sale of other Solid Waste businesses throughout 2014 negatively affected the

year-over-year

comparison by approximately $140 million.

•

Decrease in income tax payments

— Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $329 million lower on a

year-over-year

basis, largely driven by (i) lower

year-over-year

pre-tax

earnings primarily due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015 and (ii) the income tax implications and related impacts of divestitures and impairment charges.

•

Decrease in interest payments

— Cash paid for interest decreased $77 million primarily due to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes during 2015, which is discussed
further in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

Increase in annual incentive plan cash payments

— Payments for our annual incentive plans are typically made in the first quarter of the year based on prior year performance. Our cash flow from operations
was unfavorably impacted by approximately $65 million on a

year-over-year

basis, as the annual incentive plan payments made in 2015 were significantly higher than payments made in 2014.

•

Multiemployer Pension Plan settlements —

In 2015, we paid approximately $60 million for the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

•

Forward-starting swaps

— During the first quarter of 2014, the

forward-starting

interest rate swaps associated with the anticipated issuance of senior notes in 2014 matured and we paid cash of



Index to Financial Statements

$36 million to settle the liabilities related to these swaps, as discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This cash payment was classified as a change in
“Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.”

•

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures

— Our cash flow from operating activities was unfavorably impacted on a

year-over-year

basis by net changes in our assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities

— The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash
flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Capital expenditures —

We used $1,339 million during 2016 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,233 million in 2015 and $1,151 million in 2014. The increase in our capital
expenditures in both years is generally the result of additional spending on new business opportunities and acquisitions, growth in our existing business and asset replacement timing. In addition, the construction of a waste-water treatment facility
at one of our landfills also contributed to the increase in 2016. Although, we experienced capital expenditure increases in both 2016 and 2015, the Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management.

•

Proceeds from divestitures —

Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) were $43 million in 2016, $145 million in 2015 and $2,253 million in 2014.
In 2016 and 2015, $2 million and $79 million of these divestitures, respectively, were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations, with the remaining amounts generally
related to the sale of fixed assets. In 2014, our proceeds from divestitures were primarily related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill
and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area.

•

Acquisitions

— Our spending on acquisitions was $611 million, $554 million and $35 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, $525 million of our spending on
acquisitions was for certain operations and business assets of SWS. The remainder of our 2016 acquisition spending primarily related to our Solid Waste business. In 2015, $400 million of our spending on acquisitions was for the collection and
disposal operations of Deffenbaugh. The remainder of our 2015 acquisition spending primarily related to our Solid Waste business. All of our 2014 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information related to our acquisitions. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings.

•

Investments in unconsolidated entities

— We made $21 million, $20 million and $33 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In
2016 and 2015, our investments primarily consisted of additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility, which generates federal tax credits. In 2014, our investments primarily related to additional capital
contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility and waste diversion technology companies.

•

Net receipts from restricted funds

— Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts contributed $51 million and $19 million to our investing activities in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. In 2015, these activities were largely related to our replacement of funded trust and escrow accounts with alternative forms of financial assurance.

•

Other

— Net cash used by our other investing activities was $4 million and $58 million in 2016 and 2014, respectively, and net cash provided by our other investing activities was
$3 million during 2015. Net cash used by our other investing activities of $58 million during 2014 was primarily associated with the funding of notes receivable associated with Wheelabrator’s investments in the United Kingdom, prior
to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014.



Index to Financial Statements

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The most significant items affecting the
comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Common stock repurchase program —

For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors.

We paid $725 million, $600 million and $600 million for share repurchases during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 15
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We announced in December 2016 that the Board of Directors has
authorized up to $750 million in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend
declarations.

•

Cash dividends —

For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors.

We paid aggregate cash dividends of $726 million, $695 million and $693 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
increase in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.375 in 2014 to $0.385 in 2015 and to $0.41 in 2016 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as a result of our common
stock repurchase program.

In December 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.41
to $0.425 per share for dividends declared in 2017. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future
business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

•

Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options —

The exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $63 million, $77 million and $93 million during 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively. The year-over-year changes are generally due to the number of stock options exercised and the exercise price of those options.

Premiums paid on early extinguishment of debt —

Premiums paid on early extinguishment of debt were $2 million and $555 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount for 2015 was primarily
related to (i) make-whole premiums paid on certain senior notes that the Company decided to redeem in advance of their scheduled maturities and (ii) premiums paid to tender certain high-coupon senior notes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions.

•

Acquisitions of and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests

— The acquisitions of and distributions paid to our noncontrolling interests were $1 million, $1 million and
$125 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The amount for 2014 is primarily attributable to the purchase of the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs related to our waste-to-energy facilities in December 2014 for $91 million. The
LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the Wheelabrator divestiture, also in December 2014. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these LLCs.

Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016, without the impact of discounting and
inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and

post-closure

will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills.

(b)

These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments related to our

long-term

debt, excluding interest.

(c)

Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2016 include $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire within the next 12 months. If the

re-offerings

of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the
scheduled maturity of the borrowings for purposes of this disclosure. For additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

(d)

Our recorded debt obligations include

non-cash

adjustments associated with discounts, premiums, deferred loan costs and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging
activities. These amounts have been excluded as they will not impact our liquidity in future periods.

(e)

Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods and interest payable on our debt. We have also made certain
guarantees, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

(f)

Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our

variable-rate

debt was calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2016. For
debt balances outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, we have reflected limited interest amounts due to the

short-term

nature of the borrowings. For debt balances outstanding under
our Canadian term loan, we have reflected interest based on the current outstanding principal assuming the amount remains unchanged through maturity. As of December 31, 2016, we had $88 million of accrued interest related to our debt
obligations.

(g)

Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require
us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are subject to change
and actual cash flow obligations in the near future may be different. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations.

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements

We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the

Guarantees

section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial
position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2016, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

New Accounting Standards Pending Adoption

Income Taxes —

In October 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the timing of recognition of income
taxes for

intra-entity

transfers of assets other than inventory. The amended guidance requires the recognition of income taxes when the transfer of the asset occurs, which replaces current U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) that defers the recognition of income taxes until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on
January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows —

In August 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance
associated with the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash
flows. The objective of both amendments was to reduce existing diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of this
amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Financial Instrument Credit Losses —

In June 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the measurement
of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable, with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are
assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Stock
Compensation —

In March 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with

stock-based

compensation as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity of
compliance with GAAP, while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided. The amended guidance changes both the accounting and financial reporting for certain income tax impacts of stock-based compensation. All excess tax
benefits and tax deficiencies will be required to be recognized as an income tax benefit or provision rather than as a component of equity. The guidance also provides for changes in the calculation of forfeitures related to the expense of
stock-based compensation. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this amended guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Leases

— In February 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with lease accounting. The amended guidance
requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases. The disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will
also be required. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial
statements and disclosures.



Index to Financial Statements

Financial Instruments

— In January 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative
guidance associated with the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The amended guidance will require certain equity investments that are not consolidated to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized
in net income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and
evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

— In May 2014, the FASB issued
amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended guidance associated with revenue
recognition is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented (“full retrospective method”) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption (“modified retrospective method”).

To assess the impact of the
standard, we utilized internal resources to lead the implementation effort and supplemented them with external resources. Our internal resources read the amended guidance, attended trainings and consulted with

non-authoritative

groups to assist with interpretation of the amended guidance. Surveys were sent to and returned by all operating segments to assess the potential impact of the amended guidance and to tailor
specific procedures to evaluate the potential impact. Based on the results of these surveys, we judgmentally selected a sample of contracts based on size and specifically identified contract traits that could be accounted for differently under the
amended guidance. We also selected a representative sample of contracts to corroborate the survey results. We have completed our preliminary review of all contracts and are in the process of compiling and summarizing the results to determine whether
additional review and analysis is necessary.

Based on our work to date, we believe we have identified all material contract types and
costs that may be impacted by this amended guidance. We expect to quantify and disclose the expected impact, if any, of adopting this amended guidance in the third quarter Form 10-Q. While we are still evaluating the impact of the amended guidance,
we currently do not expect it to have a material impact on operating revenues.

Upon adoption of the amended guidance, we anticipate
recognizing an asset from the capitalization of sales incentives as contract acquisitions costs. Under the amended guidance, sales incentives will be capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship. Currently, the
Company expenses approximately $65 million in sales incentives annually. As noted above, we are still evaluating other possible impacts on our consolidated financial statements, including potential changes in the classification of certain
revenue streams currently reported on a gross basis and on our disclosures. The Company is also currently planning to adopt the amended guidance using the modified retrospective method as of January 1, 2018.

Inflation

While inflationary increases
in costs can affect our income from operations margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2016,
approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and
will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.



Index to Financial Statements

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain
commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2016.

Interest Rate Exposure

— Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $9.4 billion of

long-term

debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives, discounts, premiums and
debt issuance costs. We have $1.6 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months. Our

variable-rate

debt obligations include (i) $491 million of
tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (ii) $473 million of

tax-

exempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire
within the next 12 months; (iii) $426 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and (iv) $239 million of borrowings outstanding under our Canadian term loan. We currently estimate that a
100-basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding

variable-rate

debt obligations would increase our 2017 interest expense by approximately $15 million.

Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our
fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change.

We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market

risk-sensitive

debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An
instantaneous, 100-basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $595 million at December 31, 2016.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust
funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short-term
maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

Commodity Price Exposure

— In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market
risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the
markets in which we operate. We attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities
increase or decrease, our revenues may also increase or decrease.

Currency Rate Exposure

— We have operations in Canada as
well as certain support functions in India and investments in Hong Kong. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating costs.
However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations. Historically, we hedged a portion of our foreign currency risk using currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of
intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. In March 2016, we terminated our

cross-currency

swaps. At termination, we received $67 million in cash for the fair value of the hedged
position and reported this amount as a component of “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The realized loss from the termination did not materially affect our results of operations. Refer
to Notes 8 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives and translation.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the principal executive and financial officers, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal controls are
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and includes those policies and procedures that:

i.

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

ii.

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

iii.

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on the
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2016.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Waste Management, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016, and our report dated February 16, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014

1. Business

The financial statements
presented in this report represent the consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation; its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which Waste Management, Inc. or its subsidiaries are
the primary beneficiaries as described in Note 20. Waste Management Inc. is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. When the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in
this document, those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When we use the term “WM,” we are referring only to Waste Management, Inc., the parent holding company.

We are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services. We partner with our residential,
commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. Our “Solid Waste”
business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services. Through our subsidiaries, we are also a leading
developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the United States.

We evaluate, oversee and manage the financial
performance of our Solid Waste business subsidiaries through our 17 Areas. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, which are presented in this report as “Other.” Additional information
related to our segments is included in Note 21.

In December 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business, which provides waste-to-energy
services and manages

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants. Refer to Note 19 for additional information related to our divestitures.

2. Adoption of New Accounting Standards and Reclassifications

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Debt Issuance Costs

— In April 2015, and as subsequently amended, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued amended authoritative guidance associated with debt issuance costs which were previously presented as assets related to recognized debt liabilities. The amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs, other than those costs related to
line of credit arrangements, be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, which is similar to the presentation for debt discounts and premiums. This guidance was effective for the Company on January 1,
2016. The Company’s adoption of this guidance was applied retrospectively and resulted in a reclassification of $52 million of such costs in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.

Consolidation

— In February 2015, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with consolidation. The amended
guidance makes changes to existing consolidation requirements associated with the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities, including limited partnerships and variable
interest entities. The guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

When necessary, reclassifications have been made to our prior period financial information in order to conform to the current year
presentation.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of WM, its wholly-owned and

majority-owned

subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in unconsolidated entities are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.

Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure
of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be
calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the
greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities,

long-lived

asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and
self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less
at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments
held within our trust funds and escrow accounts, and accounts receivable. We make efforts to control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other financial interests with a diverse group of
credit-worthy financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit
limits and monitoring procedures, although generally we do not have collateral requirements for credit extensions. We also control our exposure associated with trade receivables by discontinuing service, to the extent allowable, to non-paying
customers. However, our overall credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large number and diversity of customers we serve. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, no single customer represented greater than 5% of total accounts
receivable.

Accounts and Other Receivables

Our receivables, which are recorded when billed, when services are performed or when cash is advanced, are claims against third parties that
will generally be settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection
trends; type of customer, such as municipal or commercial; the age of outstanding receivables; and existing economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances indicate



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that specific receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is given to the collectability of those balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly.

Past-due

receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful. Also, we recognize interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable as the interest
accrues under the terms of the notes. We no longer accrue interest once the notes are deemed uncollectible.

Other receivables, at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, include receivables related to income tax payments in excess of our current provision for income taxes of $352 million and $439 million, respectively.

Parts and Supplies

Parts and supplies consist primarily of spare parts, fuel, tires, lubricants and processed recycling materials. Our parts and supplies are
stated at the lower of cost, using the average cost method, or market.

Landfill Accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept waste. These costs
generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property); permitting; excavation; liner material and installation; landfill leachate collection systems; landfill gas collection systems;
environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas; and directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes asset
retirement costs, which represent estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities. These costs are discussed below.

Final Capping, Closure and

Post-Closure

Costs

— Following is a description of our asset
retirement activities and our related accounting:

•

Final Capping

— Involves the installation of flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace
capacity has been consumed. Final capping asset retirement obligations are recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific final capping event with a corresponding
increase in the landfill asset. Each final capping event is accounted for as a discrete obligation and recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated with each final capping event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required), demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs incurred after the site ceases
to accept waste, but before the landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state regulatory agency. These costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase
in the landfill asset. Closure obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing closure activities.

•

Post-Closure

— Involves the maintenance and monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to maintain and monitor
landfill sites for a 30-year period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset.

Post-closure

obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing

post-closure

activities.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel,
engineers and accountants. Our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value. Absent quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value is based on the best
available information, including the results of present value techniques. In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use historical experience, professional engineering
judgment and quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract with third parties or perform the work
ourselves. In those instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component of operating income when the work is completed.

Once we have determined the final capping, closure and

post-closure

costs, we inflate those costs to
the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we inflated these costs in current dollars until the expected time of payment using an inflation
rate of 2.5%. We discounted these costs to present value using the

credit-adjusted,

risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred, consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes
in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the historical weighted average rate of the recorded
obligation. As a result, the

credit-adjusted,

risk-free discount rate used to calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to each individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted average rate
applicable to our long-term asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2016 is approximately 6.0%. We expect to apply a credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate of 4.0% to liabilities incurred in the first quarter of 2017.

We record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and

post-closure

liabilities for our
landfills based on the capacity consumed through the current period. The fair value of final capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the expected timing of each final
capping event. The fair value of closure and

post-closure

obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire landfill and the expected timing of each closure and

post-closure

activity. Because these obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure and post-closure
activities could result in a material change in these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or extent of future final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities typically result in both (i) a current adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset and (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively
over either the remaining capacity of the related discrete final capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace (as defined below) of the landfill. Any changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill assets are
then recognized in accordance with our amortization policy, which would generally result in amortization expense being recognized prospectively over the remaining capacity of the final capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace
of the landfill, as appropriate. Changes in such estimates associated with airspace that has been fully utilized result in an adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill assets with an immediate corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace
amortization expense.

Interest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities is recorded using the effective interest
method and is recorded as final capping, closure and

post-closure

expense, which is included in “Operating” expenses within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The amortizable basis of a landfill includes
(i) amounts previously expended and capitalized; (ii) capitalized landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs; (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs required to develop the landfill site to its
remaining permitted and expansion capacity and (iv) projected asset retirement costs related to landfill final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities.

Amortization is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying expense as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each
component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do not own, but operate through lease or other contractual agreements, the rate per ton is
calculated based on expected capacity to be utilized over the lesser of the contractual term of the underlying agreement or the life of the landfill.

We apply the following guidelines in determining a landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:

•

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The
remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace
associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the
expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and

•

Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must
meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy
provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and
circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a

landfill-specific

review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review
by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 16 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2016, three landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace
because the permit application process did not meet the one- or five-year requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our
calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and

post-closure

of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace
utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for
future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining,
depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent

multi-level

review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill
is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will
be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets
related to closure and

post-closure

activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and

post-closure

activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such
estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most
significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense.
If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may
have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and
certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a
number of estimates and assumptions.

Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate
sites based on

site-specific

facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the
amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then
either developed using our internal resources or by

third-party

environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation is inherently difficult. We recognize and accrue for an estimated remediation
liability when we determine that such liability is both probable and reasonably estimable. Determining the method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number of assumptions be made. There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates
of the costs associated with the likely site remediation alternatives identified in the investigation of the extent of environmental impact. In these cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If no amount within a
range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately $120 million higher than the
$246 million recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2016. Our ultimate responsibility may differ materially from current estimates. It is possible that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the
results of environmental studies, the inability to identify other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require us to record additional liabilities. Our ongoing review of our
remediation liabilities, in light of relevant internal and external facts and circumstances, could result in revisions to our accruals that could cause upward or downward adjustments to income from operations. These adjustments could be material in
any given period.

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and the timing of the
payments are fixed or reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in current dollars (by 2.5% at December 31, 2016 and 2015) until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value using a risk-free discount rate, which is based on
the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted average period until settlement of the underlying obligation. We determine the risk-free discount rate and the inflation rate on an annual basis unless interim changes would
significantly impact our results of operations. For remedial liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in “Operating” expenses in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The following table summarizes the impacts of revisions in the risk-free discount rate applied to our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets during the reported periods (in millions) and the risk-free discount rate
applied as of each reporting date:

The portion of our recorded environmental remediation liabilities that were not subject to inflation or
discounting, as the amounts and timing of payments are not fixed or reliably determinable, was $90 million and $52 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Had we not inflated and discounted any portion of our environmental
remediation liability, the amount recorded would have remained the same at December 31, 2016 and decreased $3 million at December 31, 2015.

Property and Equipment (exclusive of landfills, discussed above)

We record property and equipment at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and maintenance activities are
expensed as incurred. We depreciate property and equipment over the



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for our depreciable property and equipment. When property and equipment are retired, sold or
otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations as an offset or increase to operating expense for the period.

The estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows (in years):

Useful Lives

Vehicles — excluding rail haul cars

3 to 10

Vehicles — rail haul cars

10 to 20

Machinery and equipment — including containers

3 to 30

Buildings and improvements

5 to 40

Furniture, fixtures and office equipment

3 to 10

We include capitalized costs associated with developing or obtaining

internal-use

software within furniture, fixtures and office equipment. These costs include direct external costs of materials and services used in developing or obtaining the software and internal costs for
employees directly associated with the software development project.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our business. Our most significant lease obligations are for property and equipment
specific to our industry, including real property operated as a landfill or transfer station. Our leases have varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations that we
consider in determining minimum lease payments. The leases are classified as either operating leases or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating Leases (excluding landfills discussed below)

— The majority of our leases are operating leases. This classification
generally can be attributed to either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease payments as a result of real property lease obligations that vary based on the volume of waste we receive or process or (ii) minimum lease terms that are much
shorter than the assets’ economic useful lives. Management expects that in the normal course of business our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by other leases, or replaced with fixed asset expenditures. Our rent expense during each of
the last three years and our future minimum operating lease payments for each of the next five years for which we are contractually obligated as of December 31, 2016 are disclosed in Note 11.

Capital Leases (excluding landfills discussed below)

— Assets under capital leases are capitalized using interest rates determined
at the inception of each lease and are amortized over either the useful life of the asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a straight-line basis. The present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation. Our future
minimum annual capital lease payments are included in our total future debt obligations as disclosed in Note 7.

Landfill Leases

— From an operating perspective, landfills that we lease are similar to landfills we own because generally we will operate the landfill for the life of the operating permit. The most significant portion of our rental obligations for
landfill leases is contingent upon operating factors such as disposal volumes and often there are no contractual minimum rental obligations. Contingent rental obligations are expensed as incurred. For landfill capital leases that provide for minimum
contractual rental obligations, we record the present value of the minimum obligation as part of the landfill asset, which is amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis over the shorter of the lease term or the
life of the landfill.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Acquisitions

We generally recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, based on
fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition.

Contingent Consideration —

In certain acquisitions, we agree to pay
additional amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue levels, targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for expanded landfill airspace. We have
recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition with any differences between the acquisition-date fair value and the ultimate settlement of the obligations being recognized as an
adjustment to income from operations.

Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities —

Assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies such as

pre-acquisition

environmental matters and litigation are recognized at their acquisition-date fair value when their respective fair values can be determined. If the fair values of such
contingencies cannot be determined, they are recognized at the acquisition date if the contingencies are probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated.

Acquisition-date

fair value estimates are revised as necessary if, and when, additional information
regarding these contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to finalization of purchase accounting, these revisions are accounted for as adjustments to income from operations.
All acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize goodwill, but as
discussed in the

Long-Lived

Asset Impairments

section below, we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer and supplier relationships, covenants

not-to-compete,

licenses, permits (other than landfill permits, as all landfill-related intangible assets are combined with landfill tangible assets and amortized using our landfill amortization policy), and
other contracts. Other intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are generally amortized using either a 150% declining balance approach or a

straight-line

basis as we determine
appropriate. Customer and supplier relationships are typically amortized over a term ranging between 10 and 15 years. Covenants

not-to-compete

are amortized over the term of the non-compete covenant, which is
generally two to five years. Licenses, permits and other contracts are amortized over the definitive terms of the related agreements. If the underlying agreement does not contain definitive terms and the useful life is determined to be indefinite,
the asset is not amortized.

Long-Lived Asset Impairments

We assess our

long-lived

assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards.
If necessary, impairments are recorded in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Property and Equipment, including Landfills and

Definite-Lived

Intangible Assets

— We
monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If
cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of
undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected
cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less
than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary
from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.

The
assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting
process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may
periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary
course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a
result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a

probability-weighted

cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded.

Goodwill

— At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using
Level 3 inputs.

We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative
assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we
determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment.

If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or

two-step

impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at a reporting unit. The
first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an
indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is
based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows
and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions
that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of

publicly-traded

companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of
their reported earnings.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides
a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.

Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash
flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our
reporting units is reasonable.

Refer to Note 13 for information related to impairments recognized during the reported periods.

Indefinite-Lived

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill

— At least annually, and more
frequently if warranted, we assess

indefinite-lived

intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment.

When performing the impairment test for

indefinite-lived

intangible assets, we generally first conduct
a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value
of the asset to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value.

Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We
discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe this approach is
appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected

long-term

performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business.

Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash
flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of these
assets is reasonable.

Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts

Our restricted trust and escrow accounts consist principally of funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping, closure,
post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. At several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling final capping, closure, post-closure and
environmental remediation obligations. Balances maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements; (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual arrangements;
(iii) the ongoing use of funds for qualifying final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities; (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills and (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments
held in the trust fund or escrow accounts. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $105 million of restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are primarily included in “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 20
for additional discussion related to restricted trust and escrow accounts for final capping, closure,

post-closure

or environmental remediation obligations.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Investments in unconsolidated entities over which the Company has significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Investments in entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees’ operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The following table
summarizes our equity and cost method investments as of December 31 (in millions):



Equity method investments

$


$


Cost method investments



Investments in unconsolidated entities

$


$


We monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and
write them down to their fair value when

other-than-temporary

declines exist. Fair value is generally based on (i) other third-party investors’ recent transactions in the securities; (ii) other
information available regarding the current market for similar assets and/or (iii) a market or income approach, as deemed appropriate. Impairments of equity and cost method investments are recorded in “Equity in net losses of
unconsolidated entities” and “Other, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively.

Foreign
Currency

We have operations in Canada, as well as certain support functions in India and investments in Hong Kong. Local
currencies generally are considered the functional currencies of our operations and investments outside the United States. The assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation difference is reflected as a component of comprehensive income.

Derivative Financial Instruments

From time to time, we will use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. In prior years, we used interest rate swaps to maintain a strategic portion of our long-term debt obligations at variable, market-driven interest rates or in anticipation of planned senior note issuances to effectively lock
in a fixed interest rate for those anticipated issuances. Through March 2016, we used foreign currency exchange rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates for anticipated intercompany cash transactions between Waste
Management Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary (“WM Holdings”), and its Canadian subsidiaries. Prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014, we used electricity commodity derivatives to mitigate the variability in
our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity. The financial statement impacts of our derivatives are discussed in Notes 8 and 14.

We obtain valuations of our hedging instruments from third-party pricing models. The estimated fair values of derivatives used to hedge risks
fluctuate over time and should be viewed in relation to the underlying hedged transaction and the overall management of our exposure to fluctuations in the underlying risks. The fair value of derivatives is included in other current assets, other
long-term assets, current accrued liabilities or other

long-term

liabilities, as appropriate. Any ineffectiveness present in either fair value or cash flow hedges is recognized immediately in earnings without
offset. There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness in 2016, 2015 or 2014.

•

Foreign Currency Derivatives

— Our cross-currency swaps had been designated as cash flow
hedges for accounting purposes, which resulted in the unrealized changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments being recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within the equity



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was reclassified to earnings as the hedged cash flows affected earnings. In
each of the periods presented, these derivatives effectively mitigated the impacts of the hedged transactions, resulting in immaterial impacts to our results of operations for the periods presented.

•

Interest Rate Derivatives

— Our previously outstanding interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixed-rate senior notes had been designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
Accordingly, derivative assets were accounted for as an increase in the carrying value of our underlying debt obligations and derivative liabilities were accounted for as a decrease in the carrying value of our underlying debt instruments. These
fair value adjustments are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged instruments. Treasury locks and forward-starting swaps executed in prior years were designated as cash flow hedges for
accounting purposes. The fair value of these derivative instruments was recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within the equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated balance in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified to earnings as the hedged cash flows occur.

Insured and

Self-Insured

Claims

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health
and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external
actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. The gross estimated liability associated with settling unpaid claims is included in “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets if expected to be
settled within one year; otherwise, it is included in long-term “Other liabilities.” Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are reflected as current “Other receivables” or

long-term

“Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services; from
the sale of recyclable commodities; from the sale of electricity and landfill gas, which are byproducts of our landfill operations and from the sale of oil and gas and organic lawn and garden products. The fees charged for our services are generally
defined in our service agreements and vary based on contract-specific terms such as frequency of service, weight, volume and the general market factors influencing a region’s rates. The fees we charge for our services generally include our
environmental fee, fuel surcharge and regulatory recovery fee, which are intended to pass through to customers increased direct and indirect costs incurred. We generally recognize revenue as services are performed or products are delivered. For
example, revenue typically is recognized as waste is collected, tons are received at our landfills or transfer stations, or recycling commodities are delivered.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services include, among others, certain residential contracts that are billed on a
quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as revenue in the period service is provided.

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Capitalized Interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development, including landfill expansion projects, certain assets under construction,
including operating landfills and landfill

gas-to-energy

projects and internal-use software. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, total interest costs were $394 million, $407 million and $487 million,
respectively, of which $9 million was capitalized in 2016, $16 million was capitalized in 2015 and $16 million was capitalized in 2014. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, interest was capitalized primarily for landfills under construction.

Income Taxes

The
Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and Canada. Current tax obligations associated with our provision for income taxes are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of “Accrued liabilities” and the
deferred tax obligations are reflected in “Deferred income taxes.”

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between
the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant
judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain
positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.

Should interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts would be accrued and
classified as a component of provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Contingent Liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
authoritative guidance on accounting for contingencies. We are party to pending or threatened legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters in various jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict the outcome of litigation, as it is subject to many
uncertainties. Additionally, it is not always possible for management to make a meaningful estimate of the potential loss or range of loss associated with such contingencies. See Note 11 for discussion of our commitments and contingencies.

obligations.

(b)

The amount reported in 2015 for our environmental remediation liabilities includes the impact of an increase in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our liabilities from 2.0% at December 31, 2014 to 2.25% at
December 31, 2015, resulting in a decrease of $3 million to our environmental remediation liabilities and a corresponding decrease to “Operating” expenses.

The amount reported in 2016 for environmental remediation liabilities includes the impact of an increase in the risk-free discount rate used to
measure our liabilities from 2.25% at December 31, 2015 to 2.5% at December 31, 2016, resulting in a decrease of $2 million to our environmental remediation liabilities and a corresponding decrease to “Operating” expenses.

(c)

The amount reported in 2016 for our landfill liabilities includes an increase of $13 million due to acceleration of the expected timing of closure and

activities
for a landfill. See Note 13 for further discussion of the impairment charge related to this landfill.

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The amount reported in 2016 for our environmental remediation liabilities includes the impact
of an increase of $44 million in our cost estimates associated with a subsidiary’s closed site in Harris County, Texas. See Notes 11 and 13 for further discussion of this environmental remediation adjustment.

(d)

The amount reported for our 2015 landfill liabilities include an increase of approximately $18 million as a result of our acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc. (“Deffenbaugh”).

Our recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2016 include the impacts of inflating certain of these costs based on our expectations of the
timing of cash settlement and of discounting certain of these costs to present value. Anticipated payments of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities, as measured in current dollars, are $28 million in 2017, $21 million
in 2018, $29 million in 2019, $63 million in 2020, $17 million in 2021 and $88 million thereafter.

At several of our
landfills, we provide financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. Generally, these trust funds are
established to comply with statutory requirements and operating agreements. See Notes 18 and 20 for additional information related to these trusts.

Debt Classification

As of December 31, 2016, the current portion of our

long-term

debt balance of $417 million
includes (i) $230 million of short-term borrowings under our long-term U.S. revolving credit facility (“$2.25 billion revolving credit facility”) and (ii) $187 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next
12 months, including $126 million of tax-exempt bonds.

As of December 31, 2016, we have classified $196 million of borrowings
outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility as long-term because we intend and have the ability to refinance or maintain these borrowings on a long-term basis. We generally use available cash to repay borrowings outstanding
under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and any remaining balances are maintained by extending the maturities of the borrowings. Our current projections indicate that we will maintain $196 million of the $426 million of
borrowings outstanding for the next 12 months. The remaining $230 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility is classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2016, we also have $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12
months and an additional $491 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit. The interest rates on our variable-rate

tax-exempt

bonds are generally reset on either a
daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed Company bonds with investors at

market-driven

rates and we currently expect future
remarketings to be successful. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the intent and ability to



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

use availability under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility to fund the debt obligations until they can be remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we classified these borrowings as
long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016.

Access to and Utilization of Credit Facilities

$2.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility

— Our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing in July 2020 provides us with
credit capacity to be used for either cash borrowings or to support letters of credit. The rates we pay for outstanding loans are generally based on LIBOR plus a spread depending on the Company’s debt rating assigned by Moody’s Investors
Service and Standard and Poor’s. The spread above LIBOR ranges from 0.805% to 1.3%. At December 31, 2016, we had $426 million of outstanding borrowings and $789 million of letters of credit issued and supported by this facility,
leaving unused and available credit capacity of $1,035 million.

Commercial Paper Program

— In August 2016, we entered
into a $1.5 billion commercial paper program that enables us to borrow funds for up to 397 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. In order to
borrow in the commercial paper market, the Company must obtain short-term credit ratings. We are in the process of working with the credit rating agencies to obtain these ratings and, as a result, we did not have any commercial paper borrowings
as of or during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Canadian Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility

— In March 2016, we
amended and restated our Canadian credit agreement (which includes a term loan and revolving credit facility), to decrease the revolving credit capacity, increase the amount of term credit, and extend the term through March
2019.    Waste Management of Canada Corporation and WM Quebec Inc., wholly-owned subsidiaries of WM, are borrowers under this agreement. The amended and restated credit agreement provides the Company (i) C$50 million of
revolving credit capacity, which can be used for borrowings or letters of credit, and (ii) C$460 million of non-revolving term credit that is prepayable without penalty. Prior to closing, there was a balance of C$90 million remaining
on the prior C$500 million term loan. Upon closing, the term loan was fully drawn to repay the indebtedness owed under the prior Canadian credit agreement and to repay C$370 million of intercompany debt. WM and WM Holdings guarantee all
subsidiary obligations outstanding under this credit agreement. The rates we pay for outstanding loans under the Canadian credit agreement are generally based on the applicable LIBOR plus a spread depending on the Company’s debt rating assigned
by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. The spread above LIBOR ranges from 0.875% to 1.5%. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the Canadian revolving credit agreement.

Other Letter of Credit Facilities

— As of December 31, 2016, we had utilized $492 million of other letter of credit
facilities, which are both committed and uncommitted, with terms extending through December 2018.

Debt Borrowings and Repayments

$2.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility

—

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net
borrowings of $406 million under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. These net borrowings included funds to support our acquisition of certain operations and business assets of SWS. Refer to Note 19 for additional information
related to this acquisition.

Canadian Term Loan

— During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repaid C$27 million,
or $20 million, of advances under our prior Canadian term loan reducing the balance to C$90 million at the time of the amendment and restatement of the credit agreement. Upon closing of the new Canadian credit agreement, we borrowed
C$460 million, or $347 million, to repay the prior term loan and to allow our Canadian subsidiaries to repay C$370 million, or $280 million, of intercompany debt. From April 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, we repaid
C$139 million, or $105 million, of advances under our Canadian term loan.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Senior Notes

— In May 2016, we issued $500 million of 2.4% senior notes that
mature in May 2023. We utilized the net proceeds of $496 million to repay $500 million of 2.6% senior notes that matured in September 2016.

Tax-Exempt Bonds —

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repaid $146 million of our tax-exempt bonds with available
cash. In May 2016, we elected to refund and reissue $143 million of tax-exempt bonds in order to reduce the interest costs associated with this debt. The “Loss on early extinguishment of debt” reflected in our Consolidated Statement
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $3 million of charges related to these refundings.

Scheduled Debt
Payments

— Principal payments of our debt and capital leases for the next five years, based on scheduled maturities are as follows: $610 million in 2017, $783 million in 2018, $432 million in 2019, $746 million in 2020,
and $540 million in 2021. Our recorded debt and capital lease obligations include

non-cash

adjustments associated with discounts, premiums, deferred loan costs and fair value adjustments for interest rate
hedging activities, which have been excluded from these amounts because they will not result in cash payments.

Senior Notes
Refinancing

During 2015, we recognized a

pre-tax

loss of $552 million associated with
the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through make-whole redemption and cash tender offers. We replaced substantially all of the debt extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon
interest rates and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations.

Secured Debt

Our debt balances are generally unsecured, except for capital leases and the note payable associated with our investment in low-income housing
properties.

Debt Covenants

Our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, our Canadian credit agreement and certain other financing agreements contain financial
covenants. The following table summarizes the most restrictive requirements of these financial covenants (all terms used to measure these ratios are defined by the facilities):

Interest coverage ratio

> 2.75 to 1

Total debt to EBITDA

< 3.50 to 1

Our credit facilities and senior notes also contain certain restrictions intended to monitor our level of
subsidiary indebtedness, types of investments and net worth. We monitor our compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or financing arrangements typical for our business.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions under all of our debt agreements that may have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company had no derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2016. The following discussion relates to our terminated derivatives:

Foreign Currency Derivatives

— As of December 31, 2015, we had cross-currency swaps outstanding for all of the anticipated cash
flows associated with C$370 million of intercompany debt between WM Holdings and



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

its wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries. As discussed in Note 7, in March 2016, our Canadian subsidiaries repaid the intercompany debt with proceeds from our Canadian term loan. Concurrent with
the repayment of the intercompany debt, we terminated the cross-currency swaps and received $67 million in cash. The cash received from our termination of the swaps was classified as a change in “Other current assets” and “Other
assets” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, we recognized $8 million of expense associated with the termination of these swaps, which was included in
“Other, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

These cross-currency swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges
and as of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the hedge position was reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as $15 million of current other assets and $63 million of long-term other assets. Through March 2016, when the
intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps were terminated, gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement of the underlying

non-functional

currency intercompany loans were recognized in current
earnings in the same financial statement line item as the offsetting gains or losses on the related

cross-currency

swaps. There was no significant ineffectiveness associated with our cash flow hedges during
the reported periods.

Forward-Starting Interest Rate Swaps

— At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” included $37 million and $43 million, respectively, of

after-tax

deferred losses related to terminated cash flow swaps, which are being amortized as an increase to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the ten-year terms of the related senior notes, which extend through 2024. As of December 31, 2016, $10 million of the

pre-tax

deferred losses for
these previously terminated swaps is scheduled to be reclassified as an increase to interest expense over the next 12 months.

During the
first quarter of 2014, forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $175 million matured and we paid cash of $36 million to settle the associated liabilities. The loss associated with the matured forward-starting swaps was
deferred and included as a component of the “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” balance discussed above.

Refer to
Note 14 for information regarding the impacts of our cash flow derivatives on our comprehensive income and results of operations.

Investments Qualifying for Federal Tax Credits

— We have significant financial interests in
entities established to invest in and manage

low-income

housing properties and a refined coal facility. We support the operations of these entities in exchange for a

pro-rata

share of the tax credits they generate. The low-income housing investments and the coal facility’s refinement processes qualify for federal tax credits that we expect to realize through 2020
under Section 42 and through 2019 under Section 45, respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code.

We account for our investments
in these entities using the equity method of accounting, recognizing our share of each entity’s results of operations and other reductions in the value of our investments in “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities,” within
our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $31 million, $30 million and $32 million of net losses and a reduction in our tax provision of $55 million,
$57 million and $58 million, respectively, primarily as a result of tax credits realized from these investments. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized interest expense of $3 million,
$4 million and $5 million, respectively, associated with our investment in low-income housing properties.

See Note 20 for
additional information related to these unconsolidated variable interest entities.

Other Federal Tax Credits

— During 2016,
2015 and 2014, we recognized federal tax credits in addition to the tax credits realized from our investments in

low-income

housing properties and the refined coal facility, resulting in a reduction to our
provision for income taxes of $14 million, $15 million and $13 million, respectively.

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Tax Audit Settlements

— We file income tax returns in the United States and
Canada, as well as various state and local jurisdictions. We are currently under audit by the IRS, Canada Revenue Agency and various state and local taxing authorities. Our audits are in various stages of completion.

During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we settled various tax audits. The settlement of these tax audits resulted in a reduction to our provision for
income taxes of $11 million, $10 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

We participate in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process, which means we work with the IRS throughout the year in order to resolve any
material issues prior to the filing of our annual tax return. We are currently in the examination phase of IRS audits for the tax years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and expect these audits to be completed within the next nine, 12, 18 and 30 months,
respectively. We are also currently undergoing audits by various state and local jurisdictions for tax years that date back to 2009, with the exception of affirmative claims in a limited number of jurisdictions that date back to 2000.

State Net Operating Losses and Credits

— During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized state net operating losses and credits
resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $10 million, $17 million and $16 million, respectively.

Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes

— Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of
our income tax returns and changes in state laws resulted in a reduction of $10 million, $18 million and $24 million to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Tax Implications of Impairments

— A portion of the impairment charges recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 are not deductible for tax
purposes. Had the charges been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have been reduced by $15 million, $2 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 13 for more
information related to our impairment charges.

Tax Implications of Divestitures

— During 2014, the Company recorded a net
gain of $515 million primarily related to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision
for income taxes would have increased by $138 million. During 2015, the Company recorded an additional $10 million net gain primarily related to post-closing adjustments on the Wheelabrator divestiture and had this gain been fully taxable,
our provision for income taxes would have increased by $4 million. During 2016, the Company recorded a loss of $9 million related to the divestiture of certain asset and had the associated tax loss been fully deductible, our provision for
income taxes would have decreased by $5 million. See Note 19 for more information related to our divestitures.

Unremitted
Earnings in Foreign Subsidiaries

— At December 31, 2016, remaining unremitted earnings in foreign operations were approximately $950 million, which are considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision for U.S. income
taxes were accrued for these unremitted earnings. Determination of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to uncertainties related to the timing and source of any potential distribution of such funds, along with
other important factors such as the amount of associated foreign tax credits.

Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities)

The components of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31 are as follows (in millions):

(1,182

Net deferred tax liabilities

$

(1,482

)

$

(1,391

)

The valuation allowance increased by $19 million in 2016 primarily due to changes in our capital loss and
state net operating loss carry-forwards, as well as the tax impacts of impairments.

At December 31, 2016, we had $25 million of
federal net operating loss carry-forwards and $2.0 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards. The federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards have expiration dates through the year 2036. We also had $453 million of federal
capital loss carry-forwards which expire in 2019 and 2021 and $24 million of state tax credit

carry-forwards.

We have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in realizing the benefit of certain tax loss and credit carry-forwards and other
deferred tax assets. While we expect to realize the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances, changes in estimates of future taxable income or in tax laws may alter this expectation.

These liabilities are included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets because the Company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2016, $69 million of net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized in future
periods, would impact our effective tax rate.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for
income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $2 million, $2 million and $1 million, respectively, of such interest expense as a component of our provisions for income taxes. We had
$5 million and $3 million of accrued interest expense in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not have any accrued liabilities or expense for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

We are not able to reasonably estimate when we might make any cash payments
required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. As of December 31, 2016, we anticipate that approximately $7 million of liabilities for
unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and $3 million of related tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals primarily relate to miscellaneous state tax items, each of which is individually
insignificant. The recognition of the unrecognized tax benefits is expected to result from tax audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period.

10. Employee Benefit Plans

Defined
Contribution Plans —

Waste Management sponsors a 401(k) retirement savings plan that covers employees, except those working subject to collective bargaining agreements that do not provide for coverage under the plan. United States employees
who are not subject to such collective bargaining agreements are generally eligible to participate in the plan following a 90-day waiting period after hire and may contribute, effective January 1, 2016, as much as 50% of their eligible annual
compensation and 80% of their annual incentive plan bonus, subject to annual contribution limitations established by the IRS. Prior to January 1, 2016, such employees could contribute as much as 25% of their eligible annual compensation, subject to
annual contribution limitations established by the IRS. Under the retirement savings plan, for non-union employees, we match 100% of employee contributions on the first 3% of their eligible annual compensation and 50% of employee contributions on
the next 3% of their eligible annual compensation, resulting in a maximum match of 4.5% of eligible annual compensation. Both employee and Company contributions are in cash and vest immediately. Certain United States employees who are subject to
collective bargaining agreements may participate in the 401(k) retirement savings plan under terms specified in their collective bargaining agreement. Certain employees outside the United States, including those in Canada, participate in defined
contribution plans maintained by the Company in compliance with laws of the appropriate jurisdiction. Charges to “Operating” and “Selling, general and administrative” expenses for our defined contribution plans totaled
$64 million, $61 million and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Defined
Benefit Plans (other than multiemployer defined benefit pension plans discussed below) —

WM Holdings sponsors a defined benefit plan for certain employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements that provide for participation in
this plan. Further, certain of our Canadian subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans which have previously been frozen to new participants. As of December 31, 2016, the combined benefit obligation of these pension plans was $114 million, and
the plans had $103 million of combined plan assets, resulting in an aggregate unfunded benefit obligation for these plans of $11 million. As of December 31, 2015, the combined benefit obligation of these pension plans was
$116 million, and the plans had $88 million of combined plan assets, resulting in an aggregate unfunded benefit obligation for these plans of $28 million.

In addition, WM Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries provided

post-retirement

health care and
other benefits to eligible retirees. In conjunction with our acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998, we limited participation in these plans to participating retirees as of December 31, 1998. The unfunded benefit obligation for these plans was
$26 million and $28 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension and other post-retirement
plans were $37 million and $56 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included as components of “Accrued liabilities” and long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans —

We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined
benefit pension plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in these Multiemployer Pension Plans are different from

single-employer

plans in that (i) assets contributed to the Multiemployer Pension Plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other participating employers;
(ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and (iii) if we choose to stop participating in any of our
Multiemployer Pension Plans, we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the plan. The following table outlines our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans considered to be individually

Unless otherwise noted in the table above, the most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2016 and 2015 is for the plan’s

year-end

at December 31, 2015 and
2014, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. As defined in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, among other factors, plans reported as critical are generally
less than 65% funded and plans reported as endangered are generally less than 80% funded. Under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, a plan is generally in critical and declining status if it (i) is certified to be in critical status
pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and (ii) is projected to be insolvent within the next 15 years or, in certain circumstances, 20 years.

(b)

The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates plans for which a Funding Improvement Plan (“FIP”) or a Rehabilitation Plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented.

(c)

A Multiemployer Pension Plan that has been certified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical may begin to levy a statutory surcharge on contribution rates. Once authorized, the surcharge is at the rate of 5% for
the first 12 months and 10% for any periods thereafter. Contributing employers, however, may eliminate the surcharge by entering into a collective bargaining agreement that meets the requirements of the applicable FIP or RP.

Total contributions to Multiemployer Pension Plans excludes contributions related to withdrawal liabilities discussed below.

At the date the financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available for the plan years ended in 2016.

Our portion of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and unfunded liability of the Multiemployer Pension Plans is not material to our
financial position. However, the failure of participating employers to remain solvent could affect our portion of the plans’ unfunded liability. Specific benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not negotiated with or known by the
employer contributors.

In connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and
negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. Further, business events, such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or
discontinuance of certain operations, which result in the decline of Company contributions to a Multiemployer Pension Plan could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal. In the event of a withdrawal, we may incur expenses associated with our
obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. In 2015 and 2014, we recognized aggregate charges of $51 million and $4 million, respectively, to “Operating” expenses for the withdrawal of certain
bargaining units from Multiemployer Pension Plans. In 2016, we did not recognize any charges for the withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans. Refer to Note 11 for additional information related to our obligations to Multiemployer Pension Plans
for which we have withdrawn or partially withdrawn.

Multiemployer Plan Benefits Other Than Pensions —

During the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company made contributions of $40 million, $33 million and $34 million, respectively, to multiemployer health and welfare plans that also provide other post-retirement employee benefits. Funding
of benefit payments for plan participants are made at rates as negotiated in the respective collective bargaining agreements as costs are incurred.

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Financial Instruments

— We have obtained letters of credit, surety bonds and insurance policies and have established trust funds
and issued financial guarantees to support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, environmental remediation and other obligations. Letters of credit generally are supported by our
$2.25 billion revolving credit facility and other credit facilities established for that purpose. These facilities are discussed further in Note 7. Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party
surety and insurance companies; (ii) an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) wholly-owned insurance companies, the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds and/or insurance policies on our behalf.

Management does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty in



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity, we
continue to evaluate various options to access cost-effective sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance
coverage for protection of our assets and operations from certain risks including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal
liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy. Our exposure, however, could increase if our
insurers are unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our
general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. “General liability” refers to the self-insured portion of specific third-party claims made against us that may be covered under our commercial General
Liability Insurance Policy. For our

self-insured

retentions, the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial valuation and internal
estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. As of December 31, 2016, our commercial General Liability Insurance Policy carried
self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31, 2016, our automobile liability insurance
program included a

per-incident

base deductible of $5 million, subject to an additional deductible of $4.8 million in the $5 million to $10 million layer. The changes to our net insurance
liabilities for the three years ended December 31, 2016 are summarized below (in millions):

indemnification is unavailable. Side A-only coverage cannot be

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating Leases

— Rental expense for leased assets was $125 million
during 2016, $140 million during 2015 and $159 million during 2014. Minimum contractual payments due for our operating lease obligations are $109 million in 2017, $90 million in 2018, $73 million in 2019, $62 million in
2020, $44 million in 2021 and $306 million thereafter. Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during future periods is less than current year rent expense primarily due to the effect of

short-term

leases.

Other Commitments

•

Disposal

— We have several agreements expiring at various dates through 2052 that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under these

put-or-pay

agreements, we are required to pay for the agreed upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the facilities. Additionally, following the sale of our Wheelabrator business, we
entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments with certain market price resets through 2021. We generally fulfill
our minimum contractual obligations by disposing of volumes collected in the ordinary course of business at these disposal facilities.

•

Waste Paper

— We are party to waste paper purchase agreements expiring at various dates through 2019 that require us to purchase a minimum number of tons of waste paper. The cost per ton we pay is
based on market prices.

•

Royalties

— We have various arrangements that require us to make royalty payments to third parties including prior land owners, lessors or host communities where our operations are located. Our
obligations generally are based on per ton rates for waste actually received at our transfer stations or landfills. Royalty agreements that are

non-cancelable

and require fixed or minimum payments are included
in our “Capital leases and other” debt obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as disclosed in Note 7.

Our
unconditional purchase obligations are generally established in the ordinary course of our business and are structured in a manner that provides us with access to important resources at competitive, market-driven rates. We may also establish
unconditional purchase obligations in conjunction with acquisitions or divestitures. Our actual future minimum obligations under these outstanding purchase agreements are generally quantity driven and, as a result, our associated financial
obligations are not fixed as of December 31, 2016. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or
services. As of December 31, 2016, our estimated minimum obligations for the above-described purchase obligations, which are not recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $179 million in 2017, $149 million in 2018,
$112 million in 2019, $92 million in 2020, $88 million in 2021 and $336 million thereafter. We currently expect the products and services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the needs of our ongoing operations.
Therefore, we do not expect these established arrangements to materially impact our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following guarantee agreements associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2016, WM Holdings has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WM’s senior
indebtedness, including its senior notes, $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and certain letter of



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

credit facilities, which mature through 2045. WM has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior indebtedness of WM Holdings, which matures in 2026. Performance under these guarantee
agreements would be required if either party defaulted on their respective obligations. No additional liabilities have been recorded for these intercompany guarantees because all of the underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See Note 23 for further information.

WM and WM Holdings have guaranteed subsidiary debt obligations, including the Canadian term loan and revolving credit facility, tax-exempt bonds, capital leases and other indebtedness. If a subsidiary fails to
meet its obligations associated with its debt agreements as they come due, WM or WM Holdings will be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No additional liabilities have been recorded for these intercompany guarantees because
all of the underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 for information related to the balances and maturities of these debt obligations.

•

Before the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, WM had guaranteed certain operational and financial performance obligations of Wheelabrator and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. In
conjunction with the divestiture, certain WM guarantees of Wheelabrator obligations were terminated, but others continued and are now guarantees of third-party obligations. Wheelabrator is working with the various third-party beneficiaries to
release WM from these guarantees, but until they are successful, WM has agreed to retain the guarantees and, in exchange, receive a credit support fee. The most significant of these guarantees specifically define WM’s maximum financial
obligation over the course of the relevant agreements. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, WM’s maximum future payments under these guarantees were $96 million and $106 million, respectively. WM’s exposure under certain of the
performance guarantees is variable and a maximum exposure is not defined. We have recorded the fair value of the operational and financial performance guarantees, some of which could extend through 2038 if not terminated, in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The estimated fair value of WM’s potential obligation associated with guarantees of Wheelabrator obligations (net of credit support fee) at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $11 million and $13 million, respectively. We currently
do not expect the financial impact of such operational and financial performance guarantees to materially exceed the recorded fair value.

•

We have guaranteed certain financial obligations of unconsolidated entities. The related obligations, which mature through 2020, are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, our
maximum future payments associated with these guarantees are $6 million. Any requirement to act under these guarantees would not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market or contractually-determined value of certain homeowners’ properties that are adjacent to certain of our landfills. These guarantee agreements extend
over the life of the respective landfill. Under these agreements, we would be responsible for the difference, if any, between the sale value and the guaranteed market or contractually-determined value of the homeowners’ properties. As of
December 31, 2016, we have agreements guaranteeing certain market value losses for approximately 850 homeowners’ properties adjacent to or near 22 of our landfills. We do not believe that these contingent obligations will have a material effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

We have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested assets for the occurrence of specified events
under certain of our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items that are currently recorded as obligations, we do not believe that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations associated with these indemnities.
Additionally, under certain of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial targets or other



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

market conditions are achieved post-closing and we have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on an estimate of the fair value of these contingencies at the time of
acquisition. We do not currently believe that contingent obligations to provide indemnification or pay additional post-closing consideration in connection with our divestitures or acquisitions will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

•

WM and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial and general operating obligations of certain of their subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual obligations as they come due, the
guarantor has an unconditional obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has been recorded for service, financial or general operating guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly accounted for as costs of
operations as services are provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly accounted for as operating or capital
leases, as appropriate.

Environmental Matters

— A significant portion of our operating costs and capital
expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection. The nature of our operations, particularly with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of our landfills, subjects us to an array of laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to
remediation activity required by state or local authorities, such liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations. The costs associated with these liabilities can include settlements, certain legal and consultant
fees, as well as incremental internal and external costs directly associated with site investigation and clean-up.

As of December 31,
2016, we had been notified by the government that we are a PRP in connection with 75 locations listed on the EPA’s Superfund National Priorities List (“NPL”). Of the 75 sites at which claims have been made against us, 15 are sites we
own. Each of the NPL sites we own was initially developed by others as a landfill disposal facility. At each of these facilities, we are working in conjunction with the government to evaluate or remediate identified site problems, and we have either
agreed with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing the costs of remediation or are working toward a cost-sharing agreement. We generally expect to receive any amounts due from other participating parties at or near the time that
we make the remedial expenditures. The other 60 NPL sites, which we do not own, are at various procedural stages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of proceedings involving NPL sites that we do not own are based on allegations that certain of our subsidiaries (or their
predecessors) transported hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to or disposing at the sites. Proceedings
arising under Superfund typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or recover costs associated with site investigation and remediation, which costs could be substantial and
could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. At some of the sites at which we have been identified as a PRP, our liability is well defined as a consequence of a governmental decision and an agreement among liable
parties as to the share each will pay for implementing that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has been selected or the liable parties have been unable to agree on an appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain.

In September 2016, the EPA announced a proposed remediation plan for the San Jacinto waste pits in Harris County, Texas, naming McGinnes
Industrial Maintenance Corporation (“MIMC”), a subsidiary of WM, as a



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

PRP. MIMC operated the waste pits from 1965 to 1966. In 1998, WM acquired the stock of the parent entity of MIMC. During the six months ended December 31, 2016, we increased our environmental
remediation liability reserve by $44 million to record MIMC’s estimated share of the EPA’s proposed remedy. The remedy and remedial design plan for the site are not yet final. A notice and comment period with respect to the remedy
closed on January 12, 2017. MIMC filed comments, detailing its disagreement with the proposed remedy put forth by the EPA and is continuing to focus on a solution that it believes best protects the environment and public health. MIMC’s ultimate
liability could be materially different from current estimates. We remain an active participant in the EPA’s process established to evaluate and determine the appropriate remedy and remedial design plan for this site. As this site was never
owned by the Company and never operated by MIMC while under the Company’s ownership, the increase in this liability was recorded in “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” instead of
“Operating” expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 13 for further discussion.

Item 103 of the
SEC’s Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings, or such proceedings are known to be contemplated, unless we reasonably believe that the matter will result in
no monetary sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of less than $100,000. The following matter is disclosed in accordance with that requirement.

Waste Management of Hawaii, Inc. (“WMHI”) may face civil claims from the Hawaii Department of Health and/or the EPA
based upon water discharges at the Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill, which WMHI operates for the city and county of Honolulu, following three major rainstorms in December 2010 and January 2011. We do not anticipate such claims could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

From time to time, we are also
named as defendants in personal injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have contaminated the environment or, in
certain cases, on the basis of having conducted environmental remediation activities at sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of monitoring of allegedly affected sites and health care examinations of allegedly affected
persons for a substantial period of time even where no actual damage is proven. While we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, the ultimate resolution is often substantially uncertain due to the difficulty of determining the cause,
extent and impact of alleged contamination (which may have occurred over a long period of time), the potential for successive groups of complainants to emerge, the diversity of the individual plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential
contribution or indemnification obligations of

co-defendants

or other third parties, among other factors. Additionally, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain
regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation.

Litigation

— On March 26, 2015, the Company acquired Deffenbaugh. In May 2012 and December 2013, Deffenbaugh was named as a
defendant in purported class actions filed in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. These cases pertained to fuel, environmental and base rate charges included on invoices, generally alleging that such charges were not
properly disclosed, were unfair or were contrary to the customer service contracts. We settled both cases, and we received final court approval of these settlements on December 14, 2016. The settlements did not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

As a large company with operations across the United
States and Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these actions



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions that have been filed against us, and that may be filed against us in the future, include personal injury, property
damage, commercial, customer, and

employment-related

claims, including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to: alleged environmental contamination, including releases of hazardous
material and odors; sales and marketing practices, customer service agreements and prices and fees; and federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. These
actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We currently do not believe that the eventual outcome of any such actions will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

WM’s charter and bylaws provide that WM shall indemnify against all liabilities and expenses,
and upon request shall advance expenses to any person, who is subject to a pending or threatened proceeding because such person is or was a director or officer of the Company. Such indemnification is required to the maximum extent permitted under
Delaware law. Accordingly, the director or officer must execute an undertaking to reimburse the Company for any fees advanced if it is later determined that the director or officer was not entitled to have such fees advanced under Delaware law.
Additionally, the Company has direct contractual obligations to provide indemnification to each of the members of WM’s Board of Directors, our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Operating Officer and certain other senior vice
presidents. The Company may incur substantial expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and indemnification obligations in connection with actions or proceedings that may be brought against its former or current
officers, directors and employees.

Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans

— About 20% of our workforce is covered by
collective bargaining agreements with various local unions across the United States and Canada. As a result of some of these agreements, certain of our subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of Multiemployer Pension Plans for the
covered employees. Refer to Note 10 for additional information about our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans considered individually significant. In connection with our ongoing renegotiation of various collective bargaining agreements, we
may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. A complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Pension Plan may also occur if employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement
vote to decertify a union from continuing to represent them. Any other circumstance resulting in a decline in Company contributions to a Multiemployer Pension Plan through a reduction in the labor force, whether through attrition over time or
through a business event (such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations) may also trigger a complete or partial withdrawal from one
or more of these pension plans.

One of the most significant Multiemployer Pension Plans in which we have participated is the Central
States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (“Central States Pension Plan”). In 2008, we reached agreement with all of the unions involved to cease participation in the Central States Pension Plan. Since that time, litigation with
the Central States Pension Plan had been pending over several matters, including the effective date that our contribution obligations ceased. In the third quarter of 2015, we settled and paid all amounts due for all pending litigation with the
trustees for the Central States Pension Plan regarding liability for contributions to the plan and withdrawal liability resulting from the cessation of contributions. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we settled and paid all amounts due for
outstanding issues regarding plan contributions and withdrawal liability with the Teamsters Employers Local 945 Pension Fund.

In 2015, we
recognized a $51 million charge in “Operating” expenses associated with withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans, nearly all of which was associated with the Central States



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Pension Plan and the Teamsters Employers Local 945 Pension Fund withdrawals discussed above. We do not believe that any future liability for withdrawals from the Multiemployer Pension Plans to
which we contribute, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or liquidity. However, liability for future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a particular
reporting period, depending on the number of employees withdrawn and the financial condition of the Multiemployer Pension Plan(s) at the time of such withdrawal(s).

Tax Matters

— We maintain a liability for uncertain tax positions, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Results
of audit assessments by taxing authorities are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 9 for additional discussion regarding tax matters.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of
which $2 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $15 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $10 million was
related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with the loss of a municipal contract in our Eastern Canada Area and our acquisition of Deffenbaugh. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease
obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

In August 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several
Corporate functions to better support achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, including cost reduction. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations. Approximately 650 employees
separated from our Corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $70 million was
related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

As of December 31, 2016, substantially all of the accrued employee severance and benefits related to our restructuring efforts was paid.

reporting unit and (iv) an
$8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized net charges
of $82 million, primarily related to (i) $66 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties as a result of the continued decline in oil and gas prices; (ii) $18 million of charges to write down or divest
certain assets in our recycling operations and (iii) a $5 million impairment of a landfill in our Western Canada Area due to revised

post-closure

cost estimates. Partially offsetting these charges
was $7 million of net gains from divestitures, including a $6 million gain on the sale of an oil and gas producing property in 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net gains of $160 million, primarily related to the following:

•

Divestitures

— We recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of certain
landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations. Refer to Note 19 for additional information related to our divestitures.

•

Oil and gas producing properties impairments

— We recognized $272 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties, primarily as a result of the pronounced decrease in oil
and gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2014.

•

Goodwill impairments

— We recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our recycling reporting unit.

•

Other impairments

— We recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations.

See Note 3 for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating
impairments; and see Note 21 for additional information related to the impact of impairments on the results of operations of our reportable segments.

Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized charges of $11 million primarily to write down equity method investments in waste
diversion technology companies to their fair value.

Other income (expense)

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized impairment charges of $42 million, $5 million and
$22 million, respectively, related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of minority-owned, cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies. We wrote down our investments to their fair value which was primarily
determined using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections and, to a lesser extent, third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities.

Also, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold our cost method investment in Shanghai Environment Group, which was part of our
Wheelabrator business. We received cash proceeds from the sale of $155 million, which have been included in “Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested)” within “Net cash provided by (used in)
investing activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The loss recognized related to the sale was not material.

These
charges are recorded in “Other, net” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Capital Stock

We
have 1.5 billion shares of authorized common stock with a par value of $0.01 per common share. As of December 31, 2016, we had 439.3 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue
preferred stock in series, and with respect to each series, to fix its designation, relative rights (including voting, dividend, conversion, sinking fund, and redemption rights), preferences (including dividends and liquidation) and limitations. We
have 10 million shares of authorized preferred stock, $0.01 par value, none of which is currently outstanding.

Dividends

Our quarterly dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were $726 million in
2016, or $1.64 per common share, $695 million in 2015, or $1.54 per common share, and $693 million in 2014, or $1.50 per common share.

In December 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.41 to $0.425 per share for
dividends declared in 2017. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other
factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

Our share repurchases have been authorized by our Board of Directors. Share repurchases during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were completed through
accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements. The terms of these agreements required that we deliver cash at the beginning of each ASR repurchase period. In exchange, we received a portion of the total shares expected to be repurchased
based on the then-current market price of our common stock. The remaining shares repurchased over the course of each repurchase period are delivered to us once the repurchase period is complete. Shares repurchased are reflected in the period the
shares are delivered to us. Additional information related to our ASR agreements is included below. The following is a summary of our share repurchases under our common stock repurchase program for the years ended December 31:

(a)

During 2016, we executed four ASR agreements to repurchase $725 million of our common stock. The ASR agreement entered into in November 2016 was for the repurchase of $225 million of our common stock. At the
beginning of the repurchase period, we delivered $225 million in cash and received 2.8 million shares based on a stock price of $63.41 per share. The ASR agreement completed in February 2017, at which time we received 0.4 million
additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of $69.43.

(b)

During 2015, we executed and completed two ASR agreements to repurchase $600 million of our common stock. Our “Shares repurchased” also includes 2.8 million shares related to ASR agreements that were
executed in 2014, discussed further below.

(c)

During 2014, we executed two ASR agreements to repurchase $600 million of our common stock. Our “Shares repurchased” includes the initial portion of shares repurchased based on the then-current market
price of our common stock. The ASR agreements were completed in 2015 and the final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period was $48.58.

Each ASR agreement is accounted for as two separate transactions: (i) as shares of reacquired common stock for the shares delivered to us
upon effectiveness of the ASR agreement and (ii) as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock for the undelivered shares. The initial delivery of shares is included in treasury stock at cost, and results in an immediate reduction of
the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. The forward contracts indexed to our own stock meets the criteria for equity classification, and these amounts are
initially recorded in additional

paid-in

capital and reclassified to treasury stock upon completion of the ASR agreement. As of December 31, 2016, $45 million of the ASR agreement executed in November
2016 is recorded in additional paid-in capital pending completion of this ASR agreement in February 2017.

We announced in December 2016
that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $750 million in future share repurchases, which supersedes and replaces remaining authority under any prior Board of Directors authorization for share repurchases. Any future share repurchases
will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations.

16. Stock-Based Compensation

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) under which employees that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase
shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for two offering periods for purchases: January through June and July through December. At the end of each offering period, enrolled employees purchase shares of our common stock at a price
equal to 85% of the lesser of the market value of the stock on the first and last day of such offering period. The purchases are made at the end of an offering period with funds accumulated through payroll deductions over the course of the offering
period, and the number of shares that may be purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The total number of shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately 647,000, 786,000 and 774,000,
respectively. Including the impact of the January 2017 issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2016 offering period, approximately 2.5 million shares remain available for issuance under the plan.

Accounting for our ESPP increased annual compensation expense by approximately $7 million, or $4 million net of tax provision, for
2016 and $6 million, or $4 million net of tax provision, for 2015 and 2014.

Employee Stock Incentive Plans

In May 2014, our stockholders approved our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) to replace our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“2009 Plan”). The 2014 Plan authorized 23.8 million shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan, plus the approximately 1.1 million shares that then remained available for issuance under the 2009 Plan, and
any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that are subsequently cancelled, forfeited, terminate, expire or lapse. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 23.2 million shares were available for future grants under the 2014
Plan. All of our stock-based compensation awards described herein have been made pursuant to either our 2009 Plan or our 2014 Plan, collectively referred to as the “Incentive Plans.” We currently utilize treasury shares to meet the needs
of our equity-based compensation programs.

Pursuant to the Incentive Plans, we have the ability to issue stock options, stock
appreciation rights and stock awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance share units (“PSUs”). The terms and conditions of equity awards granted under the Incentive Plans are determined by
the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

The 2016 annual Incentive Plan awards granted to the
Company’s senior leadership team, which generally includes the Company’s executive officers, included a combination of PSUs and stock options. The annual Incentive Plan awards granted to certain key employees included a combination of
PSUs, RSUs and stock options in 2016. The Company has also periodically granted RSUs and stock options to employees working on key initiatives, in connection with new hires and promotions and to field-based managers.

The total fair market value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014 was $12 million, $13 million and $3 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued approximately 136,000 shares of common stock for these vested RSUs, net of approximately 69,000 units deferred
or used for payment of associated taxes.

RSUs may not be voted or sold by award recipients until time-based vesting restrictions have
lapsed. RSUs primarily provide for

three-year

cliff vesting and include dividend equivalents accumulated during the vesting period. Unvested units are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or

for-cause

termination. RSUs are subject to

pro-rata

vesting upon an employee’s retirement or involuntary termination other than for cause and become immediately vested in
the event of an employee’s death or disability.

Compensation expense associated with RSUs is measured based on the grant-date fair
value of our common stock and is recognized on a

straight-line

basis over the required employment period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of expected forfeitures.

Performance Share Units —

Two types of
PSUs are currently outstanding: (i) PSUs for which payout is dependent on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 (“TSR PSUs”) and (ii) PSUs for which payout is dependent on the Company’s performance against

pre-established

adjusted cash flow metrics (“Cash Flow PSUs”). Both types of PSUs are payable in shares of common stock after the end of a

three-year

performance
period, when the Company’s financial performance for the entire performance period is reported, typically in mid- to late-February of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to
200% of the targeted amount, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. A summary of our PSUs, at 100% of the targeted amount, is presented in the table below (units in thousands):

The determination of achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting of PSUs for the three-year
performance period ended December 31, 2016 was performed by the Management Development and Compensation Committee in February 2017. Accordingly, vesting information for such awards is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2016. The
“vested” PSUs are for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2015, as achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting was determined in February 2016. The Company’s financial results, as measured for
purposes of these awards, were higher than the target levels established but not in excess of the maximum performance criteria. Accordingly, recipients of these PSU awards were entitled to receive a payout of 132.88% of the vested TSR PSUs and
196.15% of the vested PSUs for which payout was dependent on the Company’s performance against a

pre-established

return on invested capital metric. In February 2016, approximately 1,093,000 PSUs vested
and we issued approximately 547,000 shares of common stock for these vested PSUs, net of units deferred or used for payment of associated taxes.

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The shares of common stock that were issued or deferred during the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014 for prior PSU award grants had a fair market value of $50 million, $35 million and $8 million, respectively. PSUs have no voting rights. PSUs receive dividend equivalents that are paid out in cash based on the
number of shares that vest at the end of the awards’ performance period. PSUs are payable to an employee (or his beneficiary) upon death or disability as if that employee had remained employed until the end of the performance period, are
subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s retirement or involuntary termination other than for cause and are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or

for-cause

termination.

Compensation expense associated with our Cash Flow PSUs that continue to vest based on future performance is measured based on the fair value
of our common stock at the end of each reporting period until the performance period ends. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria.
Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of both the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and expected forfeitures.

The grant-date fair value of our TSR PSUs is based on a Monte Carlo valuation and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized for all TSR PSUs whether or not the market conditions are achieved less expected forfeitures.

Deferred Units —

Recipients can elect to defer some or all of the vested RSU or PSU awards until a specified date or dates they
choose. Deferred units are not invested, nor do they earn interest, but deferred amounts do receive dividend equivalents paid in cash during deferral at the same time and at the same rate as dividends on the Company’s common stock. Deferred
amounts are paid out in shares of common stock at the end of the deferral period. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 698,000 vested deferred units outstanding.

Stock Options —

Stock options granted primarily vest in 25% increments on the first two anniversaries of the date of grant with
the remaining 50% vesting on the third anniversary. The exercise price of the options is the average of the high and low market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and the options have a term of 10 years. A summary of our stock options
is presented in the table below (options in thousands):

All unvested stock options shall become exercisable upon the award recipient’s death or disability. In
the event of a recipient’s retirement, stock options shall continue to vest pursuant to the original schedule set forth in the award agreement. If the recipient is terminated by the Company without cause or voluntarily resigns, the recipient
shall be entitled to exercise all stock options outstanding and exercisable within a specified time frame after such termination. All outstanding stock options, whether exercisable or not, are forfeited upon termination for cause.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock
option expense at the date of grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $6.31, $5.56 and $4.55, respectively. The fair value of the stock options at the
date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period less expected forfeitures, except for stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees, for which expense is accelerated over the period that the recipient becomes

retirement-eligible.

The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to value employee stock options granted during the years ended December 31 under the Black-Scholes valuation model:




Expected option life

4.7 years

4.4 years

4.8 years

Expected volatility

18.4%

18.4%

Expected dividend yield

2.9%

2.8%

3.6%

Risk-free interest rate

1.3%

1.4%

1.6%

The Company bases its expected option life on the expected exercise and termination behavior of its optionees
and an appropriate model of the Company’s future stock price. The expected volatility assumption is derived from the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected
life of the Company’s stock options, combined with other relevant factors including implied volatility in

market-traded

options on the Company’s stock. The dividend yield is the annual rate of
dividends per share over the exercise price of the option as of the grant date.

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we
recognized $81 million, $64 million and $59 million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with RSU, PSU and stock option awards as a component of “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Our “Provision for income taxes,” for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, includes related deferred income tax benefits of $32 million, $26 million and $23 million, respectively. We
also realized excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $28 million, $15 million and $5 million, respectively. These amounts have been
presented as cash inflows in the “Cash flows from financing activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We have not capitalized any equity-based compensation costs during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Compensation expense recognized in 2016 increased when compared to 2015 and 2014, primarily
due to increases in the fair values and expected payouts of our PSUs. As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that $51 million of currently unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years for our
unvested RSU, PSU and stock option awards issued and outstanding.

18. Fair Value Measurements

Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact. Fair
value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to
the fair value measurement:

Level


— Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level


— Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level


— Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data or assumptions



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate. Our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis include the following (in millions):

Money Market Funds

We invest portions of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in money market funds. We measure the fair value of these investments
using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of our money market funds approximates our cost basis in the investments.

Available-for-Sale

Securities

Available-for-sale

securities are primarily related to the
restricted trust funds that were created to settle certain of our final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental remediation obligations, which are discussed further in Note 20. These trust funds are invested in U.S. Treasury securities and
equity and bond funds. We measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets. Any changes in fair value of these trusts related to unrealized gains and losses have been appropriately
reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

Fixed-Income Securities

We invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in fixed-income securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S.
agency securities, municipal securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets. The fair value of our fixed-income securities approximates our cost basis in
these investments.

Foreign Currency Derivatives

In March 2016, we terminated our cross-currency swaps. Previously, our cross-currency swaps were valued using a third-party pricing model that
incorporated information about forward Canadian dollar rates, or observable market data, as of the reporting date. The third-party pricing model used to value our

cross-currency

swaps also incorporated Company
and counterparty credit valuation adjustments, as appropriate. Counterparties to these contracts were financial institutions who participated in our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. Valuations fluctuated from period-to-period due to
volatility in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate over the term of the agreements.

Refer to Notes 8 and 14 for additional
information regarding the derivative instruments discussed above.

Redeemable Preferred Stock

Redeemable preferred stock is primarily related to a noncontrolling investment in an unconsolidated entity and is included in “Investments
in unconsolidated entities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of our investment has been measured based on third-party investors’ recent or pending transactions in these securities, which is considered the best evidence of
fair value currently available. When this evidence is not available, we use other valuation techniques as appropriate and available. These valuation methodologies may include transactions in similar instruments, discounted cash flow techniques,
third-party appraisals or industry multiples and public comparables. Redeemable preferred stock also includes stock received in conjunction with the 2014 sale of our Puerto Rico operations, as discussed in Note 19.

Fair Value of Debt

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of our debt was approximately $9.3 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. The
estimated fair value of our debt was approximately $9.7 billion and $9.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is estimated by using a discounted cash flow approach and current market
rates for similar types of instruments. The carrying value of our

variable-rate

debt approximates fair value due to the

short-term

nature of the interest rates. The
increase in the fair value of our debt when comparing December 31, 2016 with December 31, 2015 is primarily related to $375 million of net borrowings during 2016.

Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market
exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy available as of December 31,
2016 and 2015. These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

19. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

We
continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are accretive to our Solid Waste business and enhance and expand our existing service offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired 30



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

businesses primarily related to our Solid Waste business. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for all acquisitions was $604 million, which included $581 million in cash paid and
other consideration of $23 million, primarily purchase price holdbacks. For businesses acquired in 2016, our estimated maximum obligations for contingent consideration was not material. In 2016, we also paid $4 million of contingent
consideration for acquisitions completed prior to 2016. In addition, we paid $26 million of holdbacks, of which $16 million related to current year acquisitions.

Total consideration for our 2016 acquisitions was primarily allocated to $115 million of property and equipment, $212 million of
other intangible assets and $280 million of goodwill. Other intangible assets included $185 million of customer and supplier relationships, $23 million of covenants not-to-compete and $4 million for a trade name. The goodwill is
primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and is tax deductible.

Southern Waste Systems

/Sun Recyclin

g

(“SWS”)

— On January 8, 2016, Waste Management Inc.
of Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, acquired certain operations and business assets of SWS in Southern Florida for total consideration of $525 million. The acquired business assets include residential, commercial, and industrial solid
waste collection, processing/recycling and transfer operations, equipment, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements. The acquisition was funded primarily with borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility.

Total consideration for SWS was allocated to $93 million of property and equipment, $182 million of other intangible
assets and $250 million of goodwill. The acquisition accounting for this transaction was finalized in the third quarter of 2016. There were no significant measurement period adjustments recorded in 2016. The goodwill has been assigned to our
Florida Area, in Tier 3, and is tax deductible.

Since the acquisition date in 2016, SWS contributed revenues of
$148 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The acquired operations have not materially affected our “Consolidated net income” for the year ended December 31,
2016.

Contingent consideration obligations are primarily based on achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals,
which generally include targeted financial metrics. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance of our estimated contingent consideration obligations was $37 million and $96 million, respectively. The decrease in this balance is
primarily due to adjustments to write down our estimated obligations to fair value, including a $47 million decrease resulting from the finalization of our purchase accounting that occurred during the measurement period, see Note 21 for further
discussion, and post measurement period decreases to reflect changes in the estimated achievement of the targeted financial metrics.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 27 businesses primarily related to our Solid Waste business. Total consideration, net of
cash acquired, for all acquisitions was $646 million, which included $537 million in cash paid, purchase price holdbacks of $13 million and a liability for contingent consideration with a preliminary estimated fair value of
$96 million. Our estimated maximum obligations for the contingent cash payments were $126 million at the dates of acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, we had paid $13 million of these holdbacks and contingent consideration. In 2015,
we also paid $4 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions completed prior to 2015.

Total consideration for
our 2015 acquisitions was primarily allocated to $243 million of property and equipment, $145 million of other intangible assets and $325 million of goodwill. Other intangible assets included $131 million of customer and supplier
relationships, $8 million of covenants not-to-compete and $6 million of trade name. The goodwill is primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and $166 million is tax
deductible and $159 million is not tax deductible.

Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc. (“Deffenbaugh”)

— On March
26, 2015, we acquired Deffenbaugh, one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest, for total consideration, net of cash acquired, of $400 million. Deffenbaugh’s assets include collection operations,
transfer stations, recycling facilities and landfills. The acquisition accounting for this transaction was finalized in the first quarter of 2016. There were no significant measurement period adjustments recorded in 2016.

Total consideration for Deffenbaugh was allocated to $207 million of property and equipment, $159 million in
goodwill, $100 million in other intangible assets, $50 million in other assets, including $15 million cash acquired, and $101 million in total liabilities. Goodwill has been assigned to our Areas, primarily Tier 3 and to a lesser
extent Tier 1, and is not tax deductible.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 15 businesses related to our Solid Waste business. Total
consideration, net of cash acquired, for all acquisitions was $32 million, which included $26 million in cash paid and a liability for contingent consideration with a preliminary estimated fair value of $6 million. Our estimated
maximum obligations for the contingent cash payments were $6 million at the dates of acquisition. As of December 31, 2014, we had paid $4 million of this contingent consideration. In 2014, we also paid $5 million of contingent
consideration associated with acquisitions completed prior to 2014.

Total consideration for our 2014 acquisitions was primarily allocated
to $6 million of property and equipment, $9 million of other intangible assets and $17 million of goodwill. Other intangible assets included $7 million of customer and supplier relationships and $2 million of covenants
not-to-compete. The goodwill is primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and is tax deductible.

Divestitures

In 2016 and 2015, the aggregate sales price for divestitures of operations was $2 million and $79 million and we recognized net
losses of $9 million and net gains of $7 million, respectively. These divestitures were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations. The remaining amounts reported in
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows generally relate to the sale of fixed assets.

The aggregate sales price for divestitures of
operations was $2.09 billion in 2014, primarily related to (i) the sale of our Wheelabrator business; (ii) the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and (iii) the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern
Canada Area, as discussed further below. We recognized net gains on these divestitures of $515 million in 2014. The remaining amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows generally relate to the sale of fixed assets.

On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds
of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain

post-closing

adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from
divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net adjustments to this gain were immaterial on a pre-tax basis. In conjunction with the sale, the Company
entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. See Note 11 for further discussion of these agreements.

During 2014, we also sold our Puerto Rico operations and received proceeds of $80 million, consisting of $65 million
of cash and $15 million of preferred stock and recognized a loss of $25 million. In addition, we sold certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area and received cash proceeds of $39 million and recognized a
gain of $18 million. The gain or loss on these divestitures is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remaining proceeds from
divestitures in 2014 were comprised substantially of cash.

20. Variable Interest Entities

Following is a description of our financial interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated variable interest entities that we consider
significant:

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

Low-Income

Housing Properties and Refined Coal Facility Investments

— We have significant
financial interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility. We support the operations of these entities in exchange for a pro-rata share of the tax credits they generate. We do not
consolidate these entities as we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities as we do not have the power to individually direct the activities of these entities. Accordingly, we account for these investments under the equity
method of accounting. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our aggregate investment balance in these two entities was $84 million and $110 million, respectively. The debt balance related to our investment in

low-income

housing properties was $57 million and $80 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additional information related to these investments is discussed in Note 9.

Trust Funds for Final Capping, Closure,

Post-Closure

or Environmental Remediation Obligations
—

We have significant financial interests in trust funds that were created to settle certain of our final capping, closure,

post-closure

or environmental remediation obligations. Certain of the funds
have been established for the benefit



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of both the Company and the host community in which we operate. We have determined that these trust funds are variable interest entities; however, we do not consolidate these trust funds as we
are not the primary beneficiary of these entities because either (i) we do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the trusts or (ii) power over the trusts’ significant activities is shared. Our interests in these
trusts are accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and receivables. These amounts are recorded in “Other receivables,” “Investments in unconsolidated entities” and long-term “Other assets” in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. Our investments and receivables related to these trusts had an aggregate carrying value of $93 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

As the party with primary responsibility to fund the related final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental remediation activities for
these trust funds, we are exposed to risk of loss as a result of potential changes in the fair value of the assets of the trust. We currently expect the trust funds to continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were established.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

Trust Funds for Final Capping, Closure,

Post-Closure

or Environmental Remediation Obligations —

We also have significant financial interests in trust funds that were created to settle certain of our final capping, closure,

post-closure

or environmental remediation obligations of which we are the sole
beneficiary of these restricted balances. We have determined that these trust funds are variable interest entities and we consolidate these trust funds as we are the primary beneficiary. We account for the trust funds for which we are the sole
beneficiary as long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We reflect our interests in the unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities held by these trusts as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” These trusts had a fair value of $95 million and $94 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We are also the party with primary responsibility to fund the related final capping, closure,

post-closure

or environmental remediation activities for these trust funds and we are exposed to risk of loss as a result of potential changes in the fair value of the assets of the trust. We currently expect
the trust funds to continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were established.

Waste-to-Energy LLCs

— In
June 2000, two limited liability companies were established to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three waste-to-energy facilities that we leased, operated and maintained. We initially owned a 0.5% interest in one of the
LLCs (“LLC I”) and a 0.25% interest in the second LLC (“LLC II”). John Hancock Life Insurance Company (“Hancock”) owned 99.5% of LLC I and 99.75% of LLC II was owned by LLC I and the CIT Group (“CIT”). We
determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the LLCs and consolidated these entities in our Consolidated Financial Statements because (i) all of the equity owners of the LLCs were considered related parties for purposes of applying this
accounting guidance; (ii) the equity owners shared power over the significant activities of the LLCs and (iii) we were the entity within the related party group whose activities were most closely associated with the LLCs. During the year
ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a reduction in earnings of $39 million for Hancock’s and CIT’s noncontrolling interests in the LLCs’ earnings, which was included in our consolidated net income. The LLCs’ earnings
related to the rental income generated from leasing the facilities to our subsidiaries, reduced by depreciation expense. The LLCs’ rental income was eliminated in WM’s consolidation.

In December 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs from Hancock and CIT. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of
the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business. See Note 19 for further discussion of the sale of our Wheelabrator business.

21. Segment and Related Information

We evaluate, oversee and manage the financial performance of our Solid Waste subsidiaries through our 17 Areas. The 17 Areas constitute our
operating segments and none of the Areas individually meet the quantitative criteria to be a separate reportable segment. We have evaluated the aggregation criteria and concluded that, based on the similarities between our Areas, including the fact
that our Solid Waste business is homogenous across geographies with the same services offered across the Areas, aggregation of our Areas is appropriate for purposes of presenting our reportable segments. Accordingly, we have aggregated our 17 Areas
into three tiers that we believe have similar economic characteristics and future prospects based in large part on a review of the Areas’ income from operations margins. The economic variations experienced by our Areas is attributable to a
variety of factors, including regulatory environment of the Area; economic environment of the Area, including level of commercial and industrial activity; population density; service offering mix and disposal logistics, with no one factor being
singularly determinative of an Area’s current or future economic performance.

In 2015, we analyzed the Areas’ income from
operations margins for purposes of segment reporting and realigned our Solid Waste tiers to reflect recent changes in their relative economic characteristics and prospects. These changes were the result of various factors including acquisitions,
divestitures, business mix and the economic climate of various geographies. In 2016, there were no realignments of our Solid Waste tiers.

Tier 1 is comprised of our operations across the Southern United States, with the exception of Southern California and the Florida peninsula
and also includes the New England states, the

tri-state

area of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio and Western Canada. Tier 2 includes Southern California, Eastern Canada, Wisconsin, Minnesota and a portion of the
lower Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Tier 3 encompasses all the remaining operations including the Pacific Northwest and Northern California, the majority of the

Mid-Atlantic

region of the United
States, the Florida peninsula, Illinois and Missouri.

Our Wheelabrator business, which provides

waste-to-energy

services and manages

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants, was a separate reportable segment until the sale of the
business in 2014, as it met the quantitative disclosure thresholds.

The operating segments not evaluated and overseen through the 17
Areas are presented herein as “Other” as these operating segments do not meet the criteria to be aggregated with other operating segments and do not meet the quantitative criteria to be separately reported.

we hold in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the results of

non-operating

entities that provide financial assurance and

self-insurance

support for our Solid Waste business.

(b)

Corporate operating results reflect certain costs incurred for various support services that are not allocated to
our reportable segments. These support services include, among other things, treasury, legal, information technology, tax, insurance, centralized service center processes, other administrative functions and the maintenance of our closed landfills.
Income from operations for “Corporate and other” also includes costs

associated with our

long-term

incentive program and any administrative expenses or revisions to our estimated obligations associated with divested
operations.

(c)

Intercompany operating revenues reflect each segment’s total intercompany sales, including intercompany sales within a segment and between segments. Transactions within and between segments are generally made on a
basis intended to reflect the market value of the service.

(d)

For those items included in the determination of income from operations, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 3.

(e)

The income from operations provided by our Solid Waste business is generally indicative of the margins provided by our collection, landfill, transfer and recycling lines of business. From time to time, the operating
results of our reportable segments are significantly affected by certain transactions or events that management believes are not indicative or representative of our results. In 2014, we recognized a $519 million gain on the sale of our
Wheelabrator business. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for explanations of certain other transactions and events affecting our operating results.

of SWS in 2016 has been assigned to our Florida Area, in Tier 3. Other adjustments in 2016 relate to the finalization of purchase accounting for acquisitions executed in 2015. These adjustments primarily resulted in a decrease in the related
contingent consideration liability. See Note 19 for additional information on our acquisitions. The following table presents changes in goodwill during 2015 and 2016 by reportable segment (in millions):

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition
waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.
Additionally, from time to time, our operating results are significantly affected by certain transactions or events that management believes are not indicative or representative of our results. The following significant items have affected the
comparison of our operating results during the periods indicated:

Second Quarter 2016

•

The recognition of

pre-tax

charges of $45 million, primarily related to the impairment of minority-owned, cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies.
These impairments were substantially nondeductible for income taxes and had a negative impact of $0.10 on our diluted earnings per share.

Third Quarter 2016

•

The recognition of

pre-tax

charges of $106 million consisting primarily of (i) a $43 million impairment due to a loss of expected volumes for a landfill;
(ii) a $42 million charge to adjust our subsidiary’s estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in Harris County, Texas; (iii) a $10 million goodwill impairment charge related to our LampTracker

®

reporting unit and (iv) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company. These charges had a negative impact of $0.16 on our diluted earnings per share.



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

First Quarter 2015

•

The recognition of a

pre-tax

loss of $550 million associated with the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through make-whole
redemption and cash tender offers. These charges had a negative impact of $0.74 on our diluted loss per share.

•

The recognition of

pre-tax

charges of $14 million associated with divestitures, impairments and restructuring, which include a $7 million net loss associated with the
sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014 and a $5 million impairment charge related to a landfill in our Western Canada Area. These charges had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted loss per share.

Second Quarter 2015

•

The recognition of a $55 million charge associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded Multiemployer Pension Plans had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

The recognition of net

pre-tax

losses of $6 million primarily related to the impairment of various recycling assets and certain adjustments associated with the sale of our
Wheelabrator business. Combined, these charges had a favorable

after-tax

impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share.

Fourth Quarter 2015

•

The recognition of $70 million of

pre-tax

charges primarily to impair our oil and gas producing properties, which negatively affected our diluted earnings per share by $0.09.

•

The recognition of $8 million of

pre-tax

restructuring charges and a $4 million

other-than-temporary

decline in the value of a minority-owned, cost method investment in a waste diversion technology company. These charges had a negative impact of
$0.02 on our diluted earnings per share.

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

24. New Accounting Standards Pending Adoption (Unaudited)

Income Taxes

— In October 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the timing of recognition of income
taxes for

intra-entity

transfers of assets other than inventory. The amended guidance requires the recognition of income taxes when the transfer of the asset occurs, which replaces current U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) that defers the recognition of income taxes until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on
January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows —

In August 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance
associated with the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash
flows. The objective of both amendments was to reduce existing diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of this
amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Financial Instrument Credit Losses —

In June 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the measurement
of credit losses on financial instruments. The amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable, with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are
assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Stock
Compensation —

In March 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with

stock-based

compensation as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity of
compliance with GAAP, while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided. The amended guidance changes both the accounting and financial reporting for certain income tax impacts of stock-based compensation. All excess tax
benefits and tax deficiencies will be required to be recognized as an income tax benefit or provision rather than as a component of equity. The guidance also provides for changes in the calculation of forfeitures related to the expense of
stock-based compensation. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this amended guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Leases

— In February 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with lease accounting. The amended guidance
requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases. The disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will
also be required. The amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial
statements and disclosures.

Financial Instruments

— In January 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance
associated with the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The amended guidance will require certain equity investments that are not consolidated to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net
income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amended guidance is



Index to Financial Statements

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

— In May 2014, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance associated with
revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. Additionally, the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the Company on January
1, 2018. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented (“full retrospective method”) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial
adoption (“modified retrospective method”).

To assess the impact of the standard, we utilized internal resources to lead the
implementation effort and supplemented them with external resources. Our internal resources read the amended guidance, attended trainings and consulted with

non-authoritative

groups to assist with
interpretation of the amended guidance. Surveys were sent to and returned by all operating segments to assess the potential impact of the amended guidance and to tailor specific procedures to evaluate the potential impact. Based on the results of
these surveys, we judgmentally selected a sample of contracts based on size and specifically identified contract traits that could be accounted for differently under the amended guidance. We also selected a representative sample of contracts to
corroborate the survey results. We have completed our preliminary review of all contracts and are in the process of compiling and summarizing the results to determine whether additional review and analysis is necessary.

Based on our work to date, we believe we have identified all material contract types and costs that may be impacted by this amended guidance.
We expect to quantify and disclose the expected impact, if any, of adopting this amended guidance in the third quarter Form 10-Q. While we are still evaluating the impact of the amended guidance, we currently do not expect it to have a material
impact on operating revenues.

Upon adoption of the amended guidance, we anticipate recognizing an asset from the capitalization of sales
incentives as contract acquisitions costs. Under the amended guidance, sales incentives will be capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship. Currently, the Company expenses approximately $65 million in sales
incentives annually. As noted above, we are still evaluating other possible impacts on our consolidated financial statements, including potential changes in the classification of certain revenue streams currently reported on a gross basis and on our
disclosures. The Company is also currently planning to adopt the amended guidance using the modified retrospective method as of January 1, 2018.
