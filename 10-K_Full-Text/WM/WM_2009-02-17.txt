Item 1.

Business.

General

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
    our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
    variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary. Waste Management, Inc. is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries.
    When the terms “the Company,” “we,”
    “us” or “our” are used in this document,
    those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
    subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When
    we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to the
    parent holding company.

WMI was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name
    “USA Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a
    Delaware company in 1995. In a 1998 merger, the Illinois-based
    waste services company formerly known as Waste Management, Inc.
    became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI and changed its name to
    Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”).
    At the same time, our parent holding company changed its name
    from USA Waste Services to Waste Management, Inc. Like WMI,
    WM Holdings is a holding company and all operations are
    conducted by subsidiaries. For detail on the financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows of WMI, WM Holdings
    and their subsidiaries, see Note 22 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
    Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone
    number at that address is

(713) 512-6200.

are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as
    practicable after we file the reports with the SEC. Our stock is
    traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
    “WMI.”

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and waste-to-energy services. In providing
    these services, we actively pursue projects and initiatives that
    we believe make a positive difference for our environment,
    including recovering and processing the methane gas produced
    naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source. Our
    customers include commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers, other waste management companies,
    electric utilities and governmental entities. During 2008, no
    single customer accounted for more than 1% of our operating
    revenue. We employed approximately 45,900 people as of
    December 31, 2008.

Strategy

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving five key
    stakeholders: our customers, our employees, the environment, the
    communities in which we work, and our shareholders. Our goals
    are:

•

To be the waste solutions provider of choice for customers;

•

To be a best place to work for employees;

•

To be a leader in promoting environmental stewardship;

•

To be a trusted and valued community partner; and

•

To maximize shareholder value.

Our primary strategy is to improve our organization and maximize
    returns to shareholders by focusing on operational excellence,
    pricing excellence and the profitable growth of our business.
    Although current economic conditions are presenting challenges
    to us and others, we believe that continuously working to create
    more efficient operations and to attract and retain customers
    while raising prices are the steps that will allow us to weather
    the current environment. We continue our efforts toward revenue
    growth through pricing and differentiating our services to
    retain our customers. Additionally, we are working to lower
    operating and selling, general and administrative expenses
    through process standardization and productivity improvements.
    We do not have control over the general economic conditions that
    are affecting consumers and businesses, including ours. However,
    we do



have the ability to react to a changing environment and
    proactively take steps to reduce the impact that current
    conditions may have on our operations.

In February 2009, we announced that we were taking steps to
    further streamline our organization by consolidating many of our
    Market Areas. Our principal operations are managed through six
    Groups, as described below. Each of our geographic Groups had
    been further divided into several Market Areas. As a result of
    our restructuring, the 45 separate Market Areas that we
    previously operated have been consolidated into 25 Areas.
    Management at this level of the organization is responsible for
    selling and marketing our services and coordinating all of our
    operations within the market. In addition, they implement
    market-based strategies and plans, and provide staff support in
    administration, financial control and analysis, human resources,
    customer service, pricing and business strategy, safety, fleet
    services, and community and municipal relations. We have found
    that our larger Market Areas generally were able to achieve
    efficiencies through economies of scale that were not present in
    the smaller Market Areas. We have also realigned our Corporate
    organization with this new structure in order to provide these
    support functions more efficiently. We currently estimate that
    this restructuring will eliminate over 1,000 employee
    positions throughout the Company and result in a restructuring
    charge of between $40 million and $50 million. We
    expect to recognize most of this charge during the first quarter
    of 2009. This realignment is the natural next step in our
    efforts to lower costs and further standardize processes and
    improve productivity, and we currently estimate that it will
    provide annualized cost savings in excess of $100 million.

We intend to continue building on our strategy to meet the needs
    of a changing environment. As the largest waste services
    provider in North America, we believe we are well positioned to
    meet the needs of our customers and communities as they, too,
    Think
    Green

®

.

    We believe that helping our customers achieve their
    environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth.
    We regularly help customers reduce, reuse and recycle the waste
    they produce. We also focus on ways to convert waste to a usable
    energy source. By focusing on providing new environmentally
    responsible and sustainable solutions to our customers’
    waste problems, we believe we can create a competitive advantage
    across all of our lines of business.

Our focus on operational excellence has provided us a strong
    foundation on which to build. We intend to take advantage of
    strategic opportunities as they arise and continue to seek
    profitable growth through targeted sales efforts and
    acquisitions. We also continue to seek to grow our current
    business in different areas that fit into our current
    operations. We believe that, even in these challenging economic
    times, we can make investments that will provide long-term value
    to our stockholders.

Operations

General

We currently manage and evaluate our principal operations
    through six operating Groups, of which four are organized by
    geographic area and two are organized by function. The
    geographic Groups include our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and
    Western Groups, and the two functional Groups are our
    Wheelabrator Group, which provides waste-to-energy services, and
    our WM Recycle America (“WMRA”) Group, which provides
    recycling services not managed by our geographic Groups. We also
    provide additional waste management services that are not
    managed through our six Groups. These services include in-plant
    services, where we work at our clients’ facilities to
    provide full-service waste management solutions and provide
    opportunities for process improvements and associated cost
    reductions in their waste management. Other services not managed
    within our Groups include methane gas recovery, sub-contracted
    and administrative services performed by our National Accounts
    and Upstream organizations, portable self-storage, fluorescent
    lamp recycling and healthcare solutions services, including
    medical waste disposal. These services are presented in this
    report as “Other.”

The table below shows the total revenues (in millions)
    contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2008. More information
    about our results of operations by reportable

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins
    with a vast waste collection network. Collection involves
    picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to
    a transfer station or disposal site. We generally provide
    collection services under one of two types of arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we
    have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the
    agreements are influenced by factors such as collection
    frequency, type of collection equipment we furnish, type and
    volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the
    disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general
    market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel
    containers to most customers to store their solid waste between

pick-up

dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs
    of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many
    are designed to be lifted mechanically and either emptied into a
    truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site.
    By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial
    and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one
    employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract
    with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality,
    homeowners’ association or some other regional authority
    that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of
    the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are
    typically for periods of one to five years. We also provide
    services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to
    households. The fees for residential collection are either paid
    by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or
    service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving
    the service.



Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories
    for solid waste in North America. At December 31, 2008, we
    owned or operated 267 solid waste landfills, which represents
    the largest network of landfills in North America. Solid waste
    landfills are built and operated on land with geological and
    hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water
    pollution, and are operated under prescribed procedures. A
    landfill must be maintained to meet federal, state or
    provincial, and local regulations. The operation and closure of
    a solid waste landfill includes excavation, construction of
    liners, continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering
    of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing
    final capping of the landfill. These operations are carefully
    planned to maintain sanitary conditions, to maximize the use of
    the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be
    used for other purposes.

All solid waste management companies must have access to a
    disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. We believe it
    is usually preferable for our collection operations to use
    disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer
    to as internalization, rather than using third-party disposal
    facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize
    higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows.
    The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to
    as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including
    competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste
    deposited.

We also operate six secure hazardous waste landfills in the
    United States. Under federal environmental laws, the federal
    government (or states with delegated authority) must issue
    permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous
    waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although
    some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These
    landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards.
    Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets
    regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal
    cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before
    disposal. Generally, these treatments involve the separation or
    removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments
    that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer
    hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed
    and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term
    containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility
    at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by
    injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock
    formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is
    separated by other substantial geological confining layers.

Transfer.

At December 31, 2008, we owned
    or operated 355 transfer stations in North America. We deposit
    waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid
    waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume
    and increase the density of the waste and transported by
    transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is often critical to third-party
    haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in
    close proximity to their collection operations. Fees charged to
    third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type
    and volume or weight of the waste transferred, the distance to
    the disposal site and general market factors.

The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection
    operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain
    fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the
    disposal of the waste we collect. It allows us to manage costs
    associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks,
    railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than
    collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the
    disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated
    and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically
    located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations;
    and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer
    of the waste to one of our own disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do not own are
    generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease
    property from third parties. There are some instances where
    transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for
    municipalities. In most cases we own the permits and will be
    responsible for the regulatory requirements relating to the
    operation, closure and post closure of the transfer station.

Wheelabrator.

As of December 31, 2008, we
    owned or operated 16 waste-to-energy facilities and five
    independent power production plants, or IPPs, which are located
    in the Northeast and in Florida, California and Washington.

At our waste-to-energy facilities, solid waste is burned at high
    temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that
    is converted into high-pressure steam. As of December 31,
    2008, our waste-to-energy facilities



were capable of processing up to 21,100 tons of solid waste each
    day. In 2008, our waste-to-energy facilities received and
    processed 7.0 million tons of solid waste, or approximately
    19,200 tons per day.

Our IPPs convert various waste and conventional fuels into
    steam. The plants burn wood waste, anthracite coal waste (culm),
    tires, landfill gas and natural gas. These facilities are
    integral to the solid waste industry, disposing of urban wood,
    waste tires, railroad ties and utility poles. Our anthracite
    culm facility in Pennsylvania processes the waste materials left
    over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago.
    Ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land
    damaged by decades of coal mining.

We sell the steam produced at our waste-to-energy facilities and
    IPPs to industrial and commercial users. Steam that is not sold
    is used to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities.
    Fees charged for steam and electricity at our waste-to-energy
    facilities and IPPs are generally subject to the terms and
    conditions of long-term contracts that include interim
    adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market
    conditions such as inflation, natural gas prices and other
    general market factors.

Recycling.

Our WMRA Group focuses on improving
    the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs
    within communities and industries. In addition to our WMRA
    Group, our four geographic operating Groups provide certain
    recycling services that are embedded within the Groups’
    other operations and, therefore, are not included within the
    WMRA Group’s financial results.

Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the
    waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition. Our
    recycling operations include the following:

Collection and materials processing

— Through
    our collection operations, we collect recyclable materials from
    residential, commercial and industrial customers and direct
    these materials to one of our material recovery facilities
    (“MRFs”) for processing. We operate 98 MRFs where
    paper, metals and plastics are recovered for resale. We also
    operate six secondary processing facilities where materials
    received from MRFs can be further processed into raw products
    used in the manufacturing of consumer goods. Specifically,
    material processing services include data destruction, automated
    color sorting, and construction and demolition processing.

Plastics and rubber materials recycling

— Using
    state-of-the-art sorting and processing technology, we process,
    inventory and sell plastic and rubber commodities making the
    recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient.

Electronics recycling services

— We recycle
    discarded computers, communications equipment, and other
    electronic equipment. Services include the collection, sorting
    and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or
    recycle all collected materials.

Commodities recycling

— We market and resell
    recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the
    marketing of recyclable commodities for our own facilities and
    for third parties by maintaining comprehensive service centers
    that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market
    demands and product quality.

Fees for recycling services are influenced by frequency of
    collection, type and volume or weight of the recyclable
    material, degree of processing required, the market value of the
    recovered material and other market factors.

Our WMRA Group purchases recyclable materials processed in our
    MRFs from various sources, including third parties and other
    operating subsidiaries of WMI. The cost per ton of material
    purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport
    the finished goods to our customers. The price our WMRA Group
    pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a
    “rebate.” Rebates are generally based upon the price
    we receive for sales of finished goods and market conditions,
    but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or
    defined minimum per-ton rates. As a result, changes in commodity
    prices can significantly affect our revenues, the rebates we pay
    to our suppliers and our operating income and margins.

Other.

We provide in-plant services, in which
    employees of our Upstream organization work full-time inside our
    customers’ facilities to provide full-service waste
    management solutions. Our vertically integrated waste



management operations allow us to provide customers with full
    management of their waste, including identifying recycling
    opportunities, minimizing waste, and determining the most
    efficient means available for waste collection and disposal.

We also develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial
    use of landfill gas through our Waste Management Renewable
    Energy Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste
    decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill
    gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be
    gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel.
    The United States Environmental Protection Agency endorses
    landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, in the same
    category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At
    December 31, 2008, landfill gas beneficial use projects
    were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 111 of
    our solid waste landfills. At 80 of these landfills, the
    processed gas is delivered to electricity generators. The
    electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal
    utilities or power cooperatives. At 23 landfills, the gas
    is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct
    substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. At eight
    landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality
    natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers.

In addition, we rent and service portable restroom facilities to
    municipalities and commercial customers under the name
    Port-O-Let

®

,

    and provide street and parking lot sweeping services. We also
    have begun providing portable self-storage, fluorescent lamp
    recycling and healthcare solutions services. From time to time,
    we are also contracted to construct waste facilities on behalf
    of third parties.

Competition

The solid waste industry is very competitive. Competition comes
    from a number of publicly held solid waste companies, private
    solid waste companies, large commercial and industrial companies
    handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and
    public and private waste-to-energy companies. We also have
    competition from municipalities and regional government
    authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid
    waste collection and solid waste landfills. The municipalities
    and regional governmental authorities are often able to offer
    lower direct charges to customers for the same service by
    subsidizing their costs through the use of tax revenues and
    tax-exempt financing. Generally, however, municipalities do not
    provide significant commercial and industrial collection or
    waste disposal.

We compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees,
    geographic location and quality of operations. Our ability to
    obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other
    companies own or operate their own landfills, to which they will
    send their waste. We compete for collection accounts primarily
    on the basis of price and quality of services. Operating costs,
    disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the
    geographic areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge
    are determined locally, and typically vary by the volume and
    weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of
    handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to
    final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the
    geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment
    furnished to the customer. We face intense competition based on
    pricing and quality of service. Our customer service contracts
    limit our ability to implement certain price increases and pass
    through some of our increased costs. From time to time,
    competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept
    lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or
    to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts.

Employees

At December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    45,900 full-time employees, of which approximately 8,000
    were employed in administrative and sales positions and the
    balance in operations. Approximately 11,000 of our employees are
    covered by collective bargaining agreements.

    Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally
    require contracting parties to demonstrate financial
    responsibility for their obligations under the contract.
    Financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or
    retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits.
    Various forms of financial assurance are



also required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure,
    post-closure and remedial obligations at many of our landfills.
    In addition, certain of our tax-exempt borrowings require us to
    hold funds in trust for the repayment of our interest and
    principal obligations.

We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of
    credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and
    financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on
    several factors; most importantly the jurisdiction, contractual
    requirements, market factors and availability of credit
    capacity. The following table summarizes the various forms and
    dollar amounts (in millions) of financial assurance that we had
    outstanding as of December 31, 2008:

operating contracts. Balances maintained in these trust funds
    and escrow accounts will fluctuate based on (i) changes in
    statutory requirements; (ii) future deposits made to comply
    with contractual arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of
    funds for qualifying activities; (iv) acquisitions or
    divestitures of landfills; and (v) changes in the fair
    value of the financial instruments held in the trust fund or
    escrow accounts.

(f)

WMI provides financial guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries
    to municipalities, customers and regulatory authorities. They
    are provided primarily to support our performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure activities.

The assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be
    drawn and used to meet the obligations for which the trusts and
    escrows were established. Other than these permitted draws on
    funds, virtually no claims have been made against our financial
    assurance instruments in the past, and considering our current
    financial position, management does not expect there to be
    claims against these instruments that will have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. In an
    ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases
    and reductions in available capacity, we are continually
    evaluating various options to access cost-effective sources of
    financial assurance.

Insurance

We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general
    liability, automobile liability, real and personal property,
    workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’
    liability, pollution legal liability and other coverages we
    believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for
    insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident
    deductible under the related insurance policy. As of
    December 31, 2008, our per-incident deductible for our
    general liability program was $2.5 million and our
    per-incident deductible for our workers’ compensation
    insurance program was $5 million. As of December 31,
    2008, our auto liability insurance program included a
    per-incident base deductible of $1 million, subject to
    additional aggregate deductibles in the $1 million to
    $5 million layer and the $5 million to
    $10 million layer of $2.4 million and
    $2.5 million, respectively. Effective January 1, 2009,
    we increased the per-incident base deductible of our auto
    liability insurance program to $5 million, subject to an
    additional aggregate deductible in the $5 million to
    $10 million range of $4.8 million. We do not expect
    the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or
    other contingency to have a material impact on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated
    insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2008 are
    summarized in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state
    or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and
    transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
    are administered by the U.S. EPA and various other federal,
    state and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use,
    health and safety agencies in the United States and various
    agencies in Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our
    operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations
    and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or
    impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.

Because the major component of our business is the collection
    and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner,
    a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related,
    either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection
    measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial
    and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials
    into the environment. There are costs associated with siting,
    design, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective
    actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and
    post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition,
    development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer
    station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money
    to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There
    cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or
    maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained,
    operating permits are subject to renewal, modification,
    suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with
    these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to
    make significant capital and operating expenditures. However,
    most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of
    business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.



The primary United States federal statutes affecting our
    business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended,
    regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and
    non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop
    programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991,
    the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA,
    which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria
    for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically
    implemented by the states, although states can impose
    requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D
    standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in
    the ordinary course of our operations.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which is also known as
    Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to
    releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the
    environment that have created actual or potential environmental
    hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such
    releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal
    sites upon current and former site owners and operators,
    generators of the hazardous substances at the site and
    transporters who selected the disposal site and transported
    substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on
    the intentional disposal of hazardous substances; it can be
    based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result
    of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of hazardous
    substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable
    statutes and regulations. Liability may include contribution for
    cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action
    or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to
    federal or state regulators in an administrative or judicially
    approved settlement. Liability could also include liability to a
    PRP that voluntarily expends site

clean-up

costs. Further, liability may include damage to publicly owned
    natural resources. We are subject to potential liability under
    CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous
    substances have been disposed or as a generator or transporter
    of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, known as the
    Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into
    streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a
    variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal
    sites. If run-off from our operations may be discharged into
    surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and
    obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and,
    under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants
    in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional
    standards for management of storm water runoff that require
    landfills and other waste-handling facilities to obtain storm
    water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other
    facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a
    publicly owned treatment works, the facility must comply with
    discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before
    the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect
    “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing
    for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act
    provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for
    violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased
    federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air
    pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the
    requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal
    solid waste landfills and large municipal waste-to-energy
    facilities. Standards have also been imposed on manufacturers of
    transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles).
    In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards and
    emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and
    existing large landfills. The regulations impose limits on air
    emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject
    most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain
    operating permitting requirements under Title V of the
    Clean Air Act, and, in many instances, require installation of
    landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions
    or to treat and utilize landfill gas on or off-site. In general,
    controlling emissions involves drilling collection wells into a
    landfill and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery
    system or combustion device. We are currently capturing and
    utilizing the renewable energy value of landfill gas at 111 of
    our solid waste landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued
    additional regulations that required affected landfills to
    prepare, by January 2004, startup, shutdown and malfunction
    plans to ensure proper operation of gas collection, control and
    treatment systems.



The EPA has issued new source performance standards and emission
    guidelines for large and small municipal waste-to-energy
    facilities, which include stringent emission limits for various
    pollutants based on Maximum Achievable Control Technology
    standards. These sources are also subject to operating permit
    requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The Clean
    Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards
    applicable to municipal waste-to-energy facilities every five
    years.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended,
    establishes certain employer responsibilities, including
    maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to
    cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards
    promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, and various reporting and record keeping
    obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements.
    Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation
    and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to
    our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along
    with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain
    aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including
    safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies
    with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to
    regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise
    preempted by federal law.

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations
    that affect our operations. Sometimes states’ regulations
    are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not
    otherwise preempted by federal law. Additionally, our collection
    and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and
    regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at
    the source and waste recycling.

Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws
    that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste
    generated outside the state. While laws that overtly
    discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be
    unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory
    have been upheld in court. Additionally, certain state and local
    governments have enacted “flow control” regulations,
    which attempt to require that all waste generated within the
    state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In
    1994, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a flow control
    ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was
    privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007 the Court
    ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by
    the local government was constitutional. In addition, from time
    to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation
    authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes
    on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste.
    The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation
    allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of
    out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of
    flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate
    transportation of waste at the state level could adversely
    affect our operations. Courts’ interpretation of flow
    control legislation or the Supreme Court decisions also could
    adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management
    services.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted
    “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have
    jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or
    revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or
    permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces
    and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance
    history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in
    addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize
    the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit
    holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and
    to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness,
    unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder
    has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating
    policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance
    with applicable laws and regulations.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of
    regulations on our current and future operations.



Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In an effort to keep our shareholders and the public informed
    about our business, we may make “forward-looking
    statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to
    future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or
    other aspects of our operations or operating results.
    Forward-looking statements generally include statements
    containing:

•

projections about accounting and finances;

•

plans and objectives for the future;

•

projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our
    performance; or

•

our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or
    future events, circumstances or performance.

You should view these statements with caution. These statements
    are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or
    events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as
    of the date the statements are made. All phases of our business
    are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many
    of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone
    or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us
    and could change whether any forward-looking statement
    ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no
    obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result
    of future events, circumstances or developments. The following
    discussion should be read together with the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are
    some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and
    financial statements for 2009 and beyond.

General
    economic conditions can adversely affect our revenues and our
    operating margins.

Our business is affected by changes in national and general
    economic factors that are outside of our control, including
    consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital
    markets. Although our services are of an essential nature, a
    weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste
    generated, which decreases our revenues. Additionally, consumer
    uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the
    number or amount of services requested by customers and our
    ability to increase customers’ pricing. During weak
    economic conditions we may also be adversely impacted by
    customers’ inability to pay us in a timely manner, if at
    all, due to their financial difficulties, which could include
    bankruptcies. The availability of credit in the second half of
    2008 was severely limited, which negatively affected business
    and consumer spending generally. If our customers do not have
    access to capital, we do not expect that our volumes will
    improve or that we will increase new business.

We have $2.8 billion of debt as of December 31, 2008
    that is exposed to changes in market interest rates because of
    the combined impact of our variable rate tax-exempt bonds and
    our interest rate swap agreements. Therefore, any increase in
    interest rates can significantly increase our interest expenses.
    Additionally, the unavailability of credit on favorable terms
    can adversely impact our growth, development and capital
    spending plans.

The
    waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot
    successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial
    condition and operating results may be materially adversely
    affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental,
    quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our
    operations. In North America, the industry consists of two
    national waste management companies, regional companies and
    local companies of varying sizes and financial resources. We
    compete with these companies as well as with counties and
    municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and
    disposal operations. These counties and municipalities may have
    financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are
    available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily
    available to them. Also, such governmental units may attempt to
    impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a
    competitive advantage.

In addition, competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales
    volume or to win competitively bid contracts. When this happens,
    we may roll-back prices or offer lower pricing to attract or
    retain our customers, resulting in a negative impact to our
    revenue growth from yield on base business.



If we
    do not successfully manage our costs, or do not successfully
    implement our plans and strategies to improve margins, our
    income from operations could be lower than
    expected.

In recent years, we have implemented several profit improvement
    initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our
    revenues.

We have implemented price increases and environmental fees, and
    we have continued our fuel surcharge program, all of which have
    increased our internal revenue growth. The loss of volumes as a
    result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows
    or results of operations. We continue to seek to divest
    under-performing and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve
    their profitability. We may not be able to successfully
    negotiate the divestiture of under-performing and non-strategic
    operations, which could result in asset impairments or the
    continued operation of low-margin businesses. Additionally, in
    February 2009 we announced that we had taken steps to realign
    our field operations to combine several of our Market Areas in
    an effort to achieve greater economies of scale in our local and
    regional operations and our Corporate organization to provide
    support functions more efficiently. If we are not able to fully
    or successfully implement our plans and strategies for any
    reason, many of which are out of our control, we may not see the
    expected improvements in our income from operations or our
    operating margins.

The
    seasonal nature of our business causes our quarterly results to
    fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative
    of our future results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
    during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
    and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
    trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
    that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
    the hurricanes generally experienced by our Southern Group,
    actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However,
    for several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively
    lower margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the
    temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly
    affect the operating results of the affected regions. The
    operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher
    repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower
    winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities.

For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim
    period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
    an entire year, and operating results for any historical period
    are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future
    period.

We
    cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under
    environmental, health and safety laws, and cannot guarantee that
    they will not be material.

We could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage
    to our properties or to the property of other landowners,
    particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking
    water or soil. Under current law, we could even be held liable
    for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
    the assets or operations involved. Also, we could be liable if
    we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of
    hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or
    if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under
    applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner.
    Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, and
    may in the future, become involved in a variety of legal and
    administrative proceedings relating to land use and
    environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in
    which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to
    impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes
    involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to
    revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and



•

local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or
    governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or
    approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which
    we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or
    seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons
    involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If
    we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of
    these proceedings could result in, among other things, material
    increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material
    charges for asset impairments.

The
    waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation,
    and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations,
    increase our costs of operations or require us to make
    additional capital expenditures.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
    provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have
    a substantial impact on our business. A large number of complex
    laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental
    protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and
    related matters. Among other things, they may restrict our
    operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

•

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal,
    transfer or processing facilities or expanding existing
    facilities;

•

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal
    prices, rates and volumes;

•

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of
    out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; or

•

mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste, including
    requirements to recycle rather than landfill certain waste
    streams.

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of
    landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or
    remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills
    temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations
    may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or
    facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could
    be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste
    management facility, we must have various facility permits and
    other governmental approvals, including those relating to
    zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and
    approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to
    obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

Governmental
    authorities may enact climate change regulations that could
    increase our costs to operate.

Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the
    United States have been focusing considerable attention on the
    emissions of greenhouse gases and their potential role in
    climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to
    implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition
    of fees or taxes, could adversely affect our collection and
    disposal operations. Additionally, certain of the states in
    which we operate are contemplating air pollution control
    regulations that are more stringent than existing and proposed
    federal regulations. Changing environmental regulations could
    require us to take any number of actions, including the purchase
    of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution
    control technology, and could make some operations less
    profitable, which could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

Significant
    shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will
    increase our operating expenses.

The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable, and can
    fluctuate significantly based on international, political and
    economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our
    control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum
    Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers,
    regional production patterns, weather conditions and
    environmental concerns. We have seen average quarterly fuel
    prices increase by as much as 56% on a year-over-year basis and
    decrease by as much as 9% on a year-over-year basis within the
    last two years. We need fuel to run our collection and transfer
    trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply
    shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses.
    Additionally, as fuel prices increase, our direct operating
    expenses



increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means
    to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel
    surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses;
    however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased
    costs and some customers’ contracts prohibit any pass
    through of the increased costs. We may initiate other programs
    or means to guard against the rising costs of fuel, although
    there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that
    such programs will be successful. Regardless of any offsetting
    surcharge programs, the increased operating costs will decrease
    our operating margins.

We
    have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements,
    and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
    assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could
    negatively impact our liquidity and increase our
    liabilities.

The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for
    environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements.
    We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to
    the coverage it would provide, and therefore, our coverages are
    generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels.
    We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental
    damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to
    cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of insurance
    coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use
    these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby allowing us to
    manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The
    inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely
    manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation
    against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks.
    To the extent our insurers were unable to meet their
    obligations, or our own obligations for claims were more than we
    estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our
    financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with
    respect to environmental closure and post-closure obligations,
    we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on
    insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow
    accounts or rely upon WMI financial guarantees. We currently
    have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for
    our operations. We do not anticipate any unmanageable difficulty
    in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the future,
    although general economic factors may adversely affect the cost
    of our current financial assurance instruments. Additionally, in
    the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding,
    letters of credit or third-party insurance coverage at
    reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive
    insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other
    forms of financial assurance. It is possible that we could be
    forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other
    forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain,
    and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations
    would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and
    could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become
    due.

We may
    record material charges against our earnings due to any number
    of events that could cause impairments to our
    assets.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we
    capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to
    disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions,
    software development costs and other projects. Events that
    could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but
    are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or
    abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion
    permit. If we determine a development or expansion project is
    impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized
    capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility
    or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that
    we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We
    also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment
    annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering
    events. The recent downturn in the recycling commodities market
    could potentially cause the carrying value of WMRA’s assets
    to be lower than their fair value, resulting in an impairment to
    goodwill.

We may be required to incur charges against earnings if we
    determine that events such as those described cause impairments.
    Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our
    revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity
    prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable
    materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which
    are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The
    majority of the recyclables that we process for



sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard, known
    as OCC, and old newsprint, or ONP. The fluctuations in the
    market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our
    operating income and cash flows, as we experienced in 2008. In
    the fourth quarter of 2008, the monthly market prices for OCC
    and ONP fell by 79% and 72%, respectively, from their high
    points within the year. The decline in market prices for
    commodities resulted in a fourth quarter
    2008 year-over-year decrease in revenue of almost
    $100 million. Additionally, our recycling operations offer
    rebates to suppliers. Therefore, even if we experience higher
    revenues based on increased market prices for commodities, the
    rebates we pay will also increase and in some circumstances, the
    rebates may have floors even as market prices decrease, which
    could eliminate any expected profit margins.

Additionally, there may be significant price fluctuations in the
    price of methane gas, electricity and other energy related
    products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas
    recovery, waste-to-energy and independent power production plant
    operations. The marketing and sales of energy related products
    by our landfill gas and waste-to-energy operations are generally
    pursuant to long-term sales agreements. Therefore, market
    volatility does not cause our quarterly results to fluctuate
    significantly. However, as longer-term agreements expire and are
    up for renewal, or as market prices remain at lower levels for
    sustained periods, our revenues will be adversely affected.
    Additionally, revenues from our independent power production
    plants can be affected by price fluctuations. In the past two
    years, the year-over-year changes in the average quarterly
    electricity prices have ranged from increases of as much as 26%
    to decreases of as much as 5%.

The
    development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal
    and waste-to-energy facilities could reduce our ability to
    operate at full capacity.

Our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill
    and waste-to-energy disposal, such as recycling and composting.
    In addition, some state and local governments mandate recycling
    and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of
    certain types of waste, such as yard waste, at landfills or
    waste-to-energy facilities. Although such mandates are a useful
    tool to protect our environment, these developments reduce the
    volume of waste going to landfills and waste-to-energy
    facilities in certain areas, which may affect our ability to
    operate our landfills and waste-to-energy facilities at full
    capacity, as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill
    disposal and waste-to-energy services.

Our
    operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions
    organizing or changes in regulations related to labor
    unions.

Labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees,
    and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain
    groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by
    unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements
    with some of the groups. Additional groups of employees may seek
    union representation in the future, and, if successful, the
    negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert
    management attention and result in increased operating expenses
    and lower net income. Considerable attention has been focused on
    proposed legislation that could amend the National Labor
    Relations Act that would make it easier for unions to become
    recognized as the bargaining representative for employees.
    Depending on the form of legislation, if any, that is ultimately
    enacted, it is reasonably possible that our operating expenses
    would increase as a result of the provisions of such
    legislation. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective
    bargaining agreements, or future legislation requires us to
    submit the terms of employment to binding arbitration in the
    event an agreement cannot be reached in a timely manner, our
    operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of
    work stoppages, including strikes, or unfavorable terms in
    agreements that result from arbitration. Any of these matters
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of
    our business and from time-to-time are involved in governmental
    proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. The timing
    of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often
    uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to
    these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements,
    either of which could require substantial payments, adversely
    affecting our liquidity.



We are
    increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if
    our technology fails, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We may experience problems with either the operation of our
    current information technology systems or the development and
    deployment of new information technology systems that could
    adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion
    of our operations until resolved. We encountered problems with
    the revenue management application that we had been piloting
    throughout 2007, resulting in the termination of the pilot,
    which has impeded our ability to realize improved operating
    margins as a result of a new system. Inabilities and delays in
    implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize
    projected or expected cost savings. There can be no assurances
    that our issues related to the licensed application will not
    ultimately result in an impairment charge, which could be
    material.

Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to
    timely collect and report financial results in accordance with
    applicable laws and regulations.

We may
    experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations
    as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
    interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting
    rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could
    adversely affect our reported operating results or cause
    unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in
    future periods.

Unforeseen
    circumstances could result in a need for additional
    capital.

We currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for
    capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, acquisitions
    and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations
    and, to the extent necessary and available, additional
    financings. However, materially adverse events, including recent
    economic conditions, may reduce our cash flows from operations.
    Our Board of Directors has approved a capital allocation program
    for 2009 that provides for up to $1.3 billion in aggregate
    dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt
    reductions. In December 2008, we announced that we expect future
    quarterly dividend payments, when declared by the Board of
    Directors, to be $0.29 per share. If the impact on our cash
    flows from operations is significant, we may need to reduce
    capital expenditures, acquisition activity or dividend
    declarations unless we are able to incur indebtedness to either
    pay for these activities or refinance our scheduled debt
    maturities. In light of the recent state of the credit markets,
    there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain
    additional financings on acceptable terms. In these
    circumstances, we would likely use our revolving credit facility
    to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had $297 million of capacity
    under our revolving credit facility.

In the event of a default under our credit facility, we could be
    required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and
    make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the
    facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally,
    any such default could cause a default under many of our other
    credit agreements and debt instruments. Any such default would
    have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we
    lease approximately 400,000 square feet under leases
    expiring at various times through 2020. Our operating Group
    offices are in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Georgia, Arizona, New
    Hampshire and Texas. We also have field-based administrative
    offices in Arizona and Illinois. We own or lease real property
    in most locations where we have operations. We have operations
    in each of the fifty states other than Montana and Wyoming. We
    also have operations in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico
    and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily
    landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and
    bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and
    equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and
    operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient
    for our current operations. However,



we expect to continue to make investments in additional
    equipment and property for expansion, for replacement of assets,
    and in connection with future acquisitions. For more

In October 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors
    approved a capital allocation program authorizing up to
    $1.2 billion of stock repurchases and dividend payments
    annually for each of 2005, 2006 and 2007. In December 2007, we
    announced that our Board of Directors had approved a capital
    allocation plan for 2008 that authorized up to $1.4 billion
    of stock repurchases and dividends. Under these programs we paid
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share for a total of
    $476 million in 2006; $0.24 per share for a total of
    $495 million in 2007; and $0.27 per share for a total of
    $531 million in 2008.

We repurchased 31 million shares of our common stock for
    $1,072 million in 2006; 40 million shares of our
    common stock for $1,421 million in 2007; and
    12 million shares of our common stock for $410 million
    in 2008. Our share repurchases in each year have been pursuant
    to Board authorized capital allocation programs, which were
    modified in both 2006 and 2007 by our Board of Directors to
    increase the amount of capital authorized for share repurchases
    by $350 million and $900 million, respectively. In
    2008, all of our common stock repurchases occurred between
    January and July. In July 2008, we suspended our repurchases in
    connection with our proposal to acquire all of the outstanding
    stock of Republic Services, Inc., and when the proposal was
    withdrawn in October 2008, we determined that, given the state
    of the financial markets, it would be prudent to suspend
    repurchases for the foreseeable future. As a result, there are
    no repurchases to report for the three months ended
    December 31, 2008 and the repurchases made during 2008 are
    significantly less than that which was authorized.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our operations for the
    three years ended December 31, 2008. This discussion may
    contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based
    on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We
    discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual
    results to differ from expectations in Item 1A,

Risk
    Factors

. The following discussion should be read in light of
    that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Overview

In 2008, we saw significant changes in the environment in which
    we operate, including severe economic uncertainty, increasing
    market volatility and continued tightening of credit markets, as
    well as a merger of two of the largest industry competitors. The
    market conditions in 2008 contributed to record high fuel and
    commodity prices during most of the year and nearly
    unprecedented drops in these commodity prices in the second half
    of the year. We often note that we are a recession resilient
    industry, but in challenging economic times, reduced consumer
    and business spending means less waste is being produced.
    Additionally, businesses across the country are experiencing
    slower demands for their products and services and a tightening
    of the credit markets, which makes it more difficult for many of
    our customers to pay their bills, leading to decreases in the
    services they request and, in some cases, cancelling our
    services all together.

Against this backdrop, we believe that our results of operations
    show just how successful we have been in improving our business.
    The highlights in 2008 include:

•

An increase in revenues of $78 million in 2008 as compared
    with the prior year, driven by internal revenue growth on base
    business due to yield of 2.8%;

•

Income from operations as a percentage of revenue of 16.7% in
    2008 as compared with 16.9% in 2007, in spite of:

•

the dislocation in the recycling commodities markets experienced
    during the fourth quarter of 2008;

•

sharply higher fuel costs throughout most of 2008; and

•

higher operating expenses in the current year for non-recurring
    items, including

(i)

a $33 million non-cash charge for an increase in the
    estimated present value of recorded obligations for
    environmental remediation liabilities due to a sharp decline in
    risk-free interest rates at year-end; and

(ii)

$50 million of costs associated with labor related matters,
    which were primarily for the withdrawal of certain collective
    bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer pension funds,
    compared with $33 million of costs incurred for labor
    disruptions in 2007;

•

Strong and consistent diluted earnings per share, which was
    $2.19 in 2008 compared with $2.23 in 2007; and

•

An increase in cash flow generated from operating activities of
    5.6%, from $2,439 million in 2007 to $2,575 million in
    2008.

We experienced revenue increases during each of the first three
    quarters of 2008 as compared with 2007, followed by a
    significant decline in revenues in the fourth quarter caused
    primarily by the effect of the recycling commodities markets and
    the decrease in revenues from our fuel surcharge program. Our
    pricing program, which focuses on ensuring that we receive
    appropriate pricing for all of our services, continued to
    provide significant increases in our revenues from base business
    yield during 2008, reflecting our commitment to pricing
    discipline



despite the economic environment. We are committed to our
    pricing excellence program, and do not intend to take volumes at
    prices that do not cover our costs and provide strong operating
    margins.

Our operating costs increased by $64 million, or less than
    one percent, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The largest
    contributors to the increase were the result of conditions
    discussed above. The negative effect of these cost increases was
    offset, in part, by benefits from our focus on operating
    efficiencies, managing fixed costs and reducing variable costs
    as our volumes decline due to (i) the slowdown in the
    economy; (ii) our pricing program; and
    (iii) divestitures.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $45 million, or 3.1%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The
    increase is largely attributable to increased labor costs as a
    result of merit increases, headcount increases, higher
    compensation costs associated with our equity-based compensation
    program for our senior employees, and higher insurance and
    benefit costs. We have also seen an increase in bad debt expense
    as a result of the weakened economy. Finally, we have incurred
    significant costs for our business development initiatives,
    which are focused on gaining new customers and entering new
    lines of business that are complementary to our core operations.
    These are costs that we believe are necessary to position Waste
    Management as a leading environmental solutions provider.

As is our practice, we are including free cash flow, which is a
    non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use
    this measure in the evaluation and management of our business.
    We also believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our
    quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions
    and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to
    repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to
    replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,”
    which is the most comparable GAAP measure. However, we believe
    free cash flow gives investors greater insight into how we view
    our liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a
    liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes
    certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed
    to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service
    requirements.

We calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below (in
    millions), which may not be the same as similarly titled
    measures presented by other companies:

Our free cash flow in 2008 exceeded the $1.4 billion we
    targeted for the year, which we believe is indicative of our
    continued ability to generate strong cash flow from our
    operations even in a challenging economic environment. The
    decrease in our free cash flow when comparing 2008 with 2007 is
    due to decreased proceeds from divestitures, which is largely a
    result of having fewer underperforming operations to sell as
    part of our

fix-or-seek-exit

initiative, offset in large part by growth in our net cash
    provided by operating activities.

Outlook

In 2008, we experienced challenges associated with changing
    market conditions, which caused significant volatility in fuel
    and recyclable commodity prices, and the tightening of the
    economy, which has put negative pressure on both consumer and
    business spending, resulting in less consumption and waste
    produced. However, we are encouraged that our 2008 results
    demonstrate that the cornerstones of our business are resilient
    in a difficult economic environment. We believe we are well
    positioned to weather the current economic downturn. In 2009, we
    will focus on (i) ensuring that we are operating
    efficiently; and (ii) generating strong and consistent free
    cash flow.

In February 2009, we announced that we are taking steps to
    further streamline our organization by consolidating many of our
    Market Areas. As a result of our restructuring, the 45 separate
    Market Areas that we previously operated have been consolidated
    into 25 Areas. We currently estimate that this restructuring
    will eliminate over



1,000 employee positions throughout the Company and result
    in a restructuring charge of between $40 million and
    $50 million. We expect to recognize most of this charge
    during the first quarter of 2009. This realignment is the next
    step in our efforts to lower costs and further standardize
    processes and improve productivity, and we currently estimate
    that it will provide annualized cost savings in excess of
    $100 million.

Although we expect that our net cash provided by operating
    activities may be negatively affected by general economic
    conditions, we believe that we will continue to generate strong
    cash flow from operations, which, along with our available cash,
    will provide sufficient liquidity to allow us to return value to
    our shareholders. Our 2009 capital allocation program provides
    for up to $1.3 billion in aggregate dividend payments,
    share repurchases, acquisitions and debt reductions. In 2009, we
    have significant debt repayment obligations, and while we
    currently intend to refinance a significant portion of the
    required repayments on a long-term basis, it is possible that we
    may not have access to the credit markets on acceptable terms.
    If the credit markets are not available to us, or are not
    available on terms we deem acceptable, we expect to rely on our
    available cash, our existing credit facility and the cash we
    generate from our operations to meet our debt repayment and
    other obligations. Our discretionary spending includes
    acquisitions of assets and businesses, dividends, repurchases of
    our common stock and certain capital expenditures. To the extent
    operating cash flows decline or are needed to support our debt
    repayment obligations, we have the ability to reduce our
    discretionary spending and still deliver superior service to our
    customers and a strong financial performance for our
    stockholders.

Over the years, the recyclables that we process have been
    subject to significant market price fluctuations, and in the
    first three quarters of 2008, increases in the prices of
    recycling commodities contributed to our revenue growth, margin
    expansion and earnings. However, our fourth quarter 2008
    operating results reflect the significant dislocation in the
    commodities markets, including substantial reductions in demand
    both domestically and internationally. In this environment, we
    have experienced sharp declines in commodity prices and a degree
    of difficulty in selling recyclable commodities, including at
    contractually defined prices. We currently expect this market
    downturn to reduce our revenues and negatively affect our
    earnings and operating cash flows in 2009. Further, a sustained
    period of depressed commodity prices

and/or

demand for recyclables could result in a significant decline in
    the estimated fair value of WMRA, which could require us to
    record a non-cash impairment charge to their goodwill.

As discussed in our

Overview

, the cost of fuel also fell
    significantly in the second half of 2008. We do not expect
    future volatility in fuel prices to significantly affect our
    income from operations. However, we do expect the sharp decline
    in fuel prices to significantly reduce (i) the revenue
    provided by our fuel surcharge program; and (ii) our direct
    and indirect fuel costs in 2009 as compared with 2008.

Technology Update —

On March 20, 2008, we
    filed a lawsuit in state court in the Southern District of Texas
    against SAP AG and SAP America, Inc., alleging fraud and breach
    of contract. The lawsuit relates to our 2005 software license
    from SAP for a waste and recycling revenue management system and
    agreement for SAP to implement the software on a fixed-fee
    basis. We have been assigned a trial date in October 2009. As we
    continue to assess the alternatives available to us, we may
    determine that the best course of action is to abandon the SAP
    revenue management system, which would result in an impairment
    charge of between $45 million and $55 million.

    of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial
    Information

Accounting Changes —

Effective January 1,
    2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 for assets and
    liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis. Our
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 during the first quarter of
    2008 resulted in the recognition of a $6 million charge to
    operating expenses and a corresponding $3 million credit to
    minority interest expense for the re-measurement of the fair
    value of environmental remediation recovery assets accounted for
    in accordance with Statement of Position

No. 96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities.

The adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 did not materially affect our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. Refer to Note 17 for information about our fair
    value measurements.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1.

FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
    attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. In
    addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the de-recognition,
    classification and disclosure of tax positions, as well as the
    accounting for related interest and penalties. FSP

No. 48-1

provides guidance associated



with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax
    position has been effectively settled and should be recognized
    as a tax benefit.

Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information related to the impact of the
    implementation of these new accounting pronouncements on our
    results of operations and financial position.

Reclassification of Segment Information

—
    During the second quarter of 2008, we moved certain Canadian
    business operations from the Western Group to the Midwest Group
    to facilitate improved business execution. We have reflected the
    impact of this change for all periods presented to provide
    financial information that consistently reflects our current
    approach to managing our operations.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
    with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting
    for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset
    impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as
    described below. Actual results could differ materially from the
    estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our
    financial statements.

Landfills

— The cost estimates for final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for
    which we have responsibility are estimated based on our
    interpretations of current requirements and proposed or
    anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional
    costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143,
    based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform
    such activities even when we expect to perform these activities
    internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to
    each final capping event and the timing of construction related
    to each final capping event and of closure and post-closure
    activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value
    using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing
    of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and
    post-closure activities would have an effect on these
    liabilities, related assets and results of operations.

Landfill Costs

— We estimate the total cost to
    develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as
    landfill liner material and installation, excavation for
    airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest,

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs.
    Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases
    for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property.
    The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on
    future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill
    includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and
    capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and
    projections of future purchase and development costs.

Final Capping Costs

— We estimate the cost for
    each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped
    and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates
    also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor
    in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel
    allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping
    events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping
    event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each
    event are amortized over the related capacity associated with
    the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review
    these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change.
    Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction,
    for final capping events immediately impact the required
    liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in
    estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to
    the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When
    the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has
    not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is
    recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill
    airspace amortization.



Closure and Post-Closure Costs

— We base our
    estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our
    interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for
    closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The
    estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also
    consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in
    inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal
    and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of
    these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less
    certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure
    events immediately impact the required liability and the
    corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a
    fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be
    amortized immediately through expense. When the change in
    estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully
    consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income
    prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

Expansion Airspace

— We include currently
    unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances.
    First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort,
    we must generally expect the initial expansion permit
    application to be submitted within one year, and the final
    expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we
    must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is
    likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 42 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2008, 19 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Ten of these landfills required
    approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of community or
    political opposition that could impede the expansion process.
    The remaining nine landfills required approval primarily due to
    the permit application processes not meeting the one- or
    five-year requirements, as a result of state-specific permitting
    procedures.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or
    AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the
    measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then
    adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement
    that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific
    factors including current and projected mix of waste type,
    initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years
    of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access
    to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill
    leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial
    selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent



multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is
    reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our
    historical experience generally indicates that the impact of
    settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the
    landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its
    highest point under the permit requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and
    post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the
    landfill.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and
    deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the
    corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization
    rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final
    capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure
    activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be
    capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or
    higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the
    opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that
    the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in
    calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be
    required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined
    that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become
    remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort
    are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— We are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
    that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities
    include potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations,
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs
    directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such
    as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to
    the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with
    environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review
    and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our
    estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates
    and assumptions.

We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.

Asset Impairments

— Our long-lived assets,
    including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our
    financial statements based on their cost less accumulated
    depreciation or amortization. We review the carrying value of
    our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
    may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential
    impairment exists, the assets’ carrying values are compared
    with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating
    future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors
    such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates,



and our estimates often vary from cash flows eventually
    realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value
    of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is generally
    determined by considering (i) internally developed
    discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset;
    (ii) actual third-party valuations;

and/or

(iii) information available regarding the current market
    environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset is
    determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
    impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the
    period that the impairment indicator occurs.

There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and
    goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the fair value of each Group to its carrying value,
    including goodwill. We rely on discounted cash flow analysis,
    which requires significant judgments and estimates about the
    future operations of each Group, to develop our estimates of
    fair value. Additional impairment assessments may be performed
    on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in
    circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not,
    the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired.

Self-insurance reserves and recoveries

— We
    have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our
    health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities
    associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated
    expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally
    is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by
    factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our
    estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly
    different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the
    frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly
    different than what we assume. Estimated insurance recoveries
    related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we
    believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Results
    of Operations

Operating
    Revenues

Our operating revenues in 2008 were $13.4 billion, compared
    with $13.3 billion in 2007 and $13.4 billion in 2006.
    We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and WMRA
    Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable segments.
    Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during

Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
    collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling
    services. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced
    by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection
    equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste
    collected, distance to the disposal facility and our disposal
    costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping
    fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume and type
    of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees
    charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume
    of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading,
    transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal
    site. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on the type and volume
    of waste received at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and
    steam. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our WMRA Group
    as well as recycling operations embedded in the operations of
    our four geographic operating Groups, generally consists of
    tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third
    parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal,
    transfer and recycling services generally include fuel
    surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for fuel.
    Our “other” revenues include our in-plant services,
    methane gas recovery,
    Port-O-Let

services, street and parking lot sweeping services, portable
    self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare
    solutions services. Intercompany revenues between our operations

    for 2008 and 2007, respectively) adjusted to exclude the impacts
    of current year divestitures ($130 million and

Base Business

— Yield on base business reflects
    the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our
    collection, transfer, disposal and

waste-to-energy

operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from
    base business yield includes not only price and environmental
    and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average
    price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are
    due to both the types of services provided and the geographic
    locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in
    average price from new and lost business; and (iii) price
    decreases to retain customers.

In both 2008 and 2007, our pricing excellence initiative was the
    primary contributor to our revenue growth from base business
    yield. Although our pricing programs are contributing to yield
    improvements in each of our core solid waste lines of business,
    the increase in revenue from base business yield has been driven
    by our collection operations in each reported period. Increased
    collection revenues due to yield were more than offset by
    revenue declines from lower collection volumes. However, we
    continue to find that, in spite of collection volume declines,
    increased yield on base business and a focus on controlling
    variable costs provide notable margin improvements and earnings
    expansion in our collection line of business.

Throughout 2008 and 2007, we also experienced increases in
    revenue due to yield on base business from our pricing
    excellence initiative at our transfer stations and the municipal
    solid waste streams at our landfills. The increases in transfer
    station revenues have been the most significant in the Eastern
    portion of the United States. At our landfills, municipal solid
    waste revenue growth from yield has been the most significant in
    our Southern Group, although the Midwest and Western Groups also
    provided notable revenue growth from yield in this line of
    business. In 2007, we also experienced increases in revenue due
    to yield on base business in the special waste and construction
    and demolition waste streams at our landfills.

In addition to the revenue growth provided by our pricing
    initiative, we saw an increase in revenue from yield at our

waste-to-energy

facilities in 2008. This increase was largely due to annual rate
    increases for electricity under long-term contracts and
    favorable energy market pricing, which is generally indexed to
    natural gas prices.

Revenues from our environmental fee, which is included in base
    business yield, were $181 million, $121 million and
    $76 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Commodity

— For the first nine months of 2008,
    revenues increased $178 million due to higher recycling
    prices as compared with the prior year period. However, during
    the fourth quarter of 2008, a rapid decline in commodity prices
    due to a significant decrease in the demand for commodities both
    domestically and



internationally caused a

year-over-year

revenue decrease of $97 million. In 2008, average prices
    for old corrugated cardboard decreased 9% and average prices for
    old newsprint increased by 14%. However, when comparing
    commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the
    comparable prior year period, average prices for old corrugated
    cardboard decreased by 58% and average prices for old newsprint
    decreased by 30%.

In 2007, average prices for old corrugated cardboard increased
    by 62% and average prices for old newsprint increased by 39%
    when compared with 2006, which drove the $306 million of
    revenue growth from commodity yield in 2007.

Fuel surcharges and mandated fees

— Fuel
    surcharges increased revenues

year-over-year

by $189 million in 2008. This increase is due to our
    continued effort to pass on our higher fuel costs to our
    customers through fuel surcharges. Although our fuel surcharge
    program is designed to respond to changes in the market price
    for fuel, there is an administrative delay between the time our
    fuel costs change and when we are able to make the corresponding
    change in our fuel surcharges. This delay negatively affected
    our ability to fully recover our cost increases in the first six
    months of 2008 as the increases in our fuel surcharges
    consistently lagged the sharp increases in fuel costs throughout
    the first half of the year. However, the cost of fuel began to
    decline during the third quarter of 2008, allowing us to fully
    recover the fuel cost increases we incurred during the year.

Fuel surcharges increased revenues

year-over-year

by $29 million in 2007. Market prices for fuel were
    relatively flat for the first nine months of 2007, but increased
    sharply during the fourth quarter. Accordingly, all of the
    revenue increase due to fuel surcharges in 2007 was generated
    during the fourth quarter, and we were unable to fully recover
    our higher fuel costs for the period.

The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily
    related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by
    various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our
    landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not
    had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for
    the periods included in the table above.

Volume

— The decline in our revenues due to
    lower volumes when comparing 2008 with 2007 has been driven by
    declines in our collection volumes and, to a lesser extent,
    lower transfer station, recycling and third-party disposal
    volumes. Decreases in 2008 revenue due to lower volumes are
    discussed in more detail below:

Our revenues from collection volumes continue to be affected by
    our focus on improving margins through increased pricing.
    However, the slowdown in the economy has also had a significant
    impact on our industrial collection line of business as a result
    of the continued slowdown in both residential and commercial
    construction activities across the United States. While our
    commercial collection line of business tends to be relatively
    recession resistant, we have experienced some volume declines in
    this business that we attribute to the sluggish economy.

Declines in revenue due to lower third-party volumes in our
    transfer station operations have been the most notable in our
    Eastern and Southern Groups and can generally be attributed to
    the effects of pricing and sluggish economic conditions. The
    declines in our revenues due to lower volumes in our recycling
    operations are attributable to the drastic decline in the demand
    for recyclables in late 2008, both domestically and
    internationally.

We have experienced declines in third-party revenue at our
    landfills due to reduced construction and demolition and
    municipal solid waste volumes throughout 2008, although the
    volume decline in our construction and demolition waste stream
    was at a slower rate than it had been in 2007 largely as a
    result of hurricane-related volume increases in our Southern
    Group. These volume declines have been offset, in part, by an
    increase in special waste disposal volumes, primarily in our
    Southern Group.

The decline in our revenues due to lower volumes when comparing
    2007 with 2006 was driven by declines in our collection volumes
    and, to a lesser extent, lower transfer station and third-party
    disposal volumes. Decreases in 2007 revenue due to lower volumes
    are discussed in more detail below:

Collection volume declines significantly affected the revenues
    of each of our collection lines of business in each geographic
    operating Group, but they were the most significant in our
    industrial collection business due to the significant slowdown
    in residential construction across the United States.



In 2007, declines in revenue due to lower third-party volumes in
    our transfer station operations were the most notable in our
    Eastern Group and were generally due to the effects of pricing.
    We also experienced declines in third-party revenue at our
    landfills due to reduced disposal volumes. The most significant
    declines were in our construction and demolition waste,
    particularly in our Southern Group. The reduction in
    construction and demolition volumes was largely due to the
    significant slowdown in residential construction across the
    United States. The volume declines for our municipal solid waste
    disposal operations were the most significant in our Midwest
    Group due primarily to our focus on pricing increases.

Waste-to-energy

and recycling revenues also declined in 2007 due to volume
    decreases. In our

waste-to-energy

business, the decrease was largely due to the termination of an
    operating and maintenance agreement in May 2007. The revenue
    decline due to lower third-party volumes in our recycling
    business was primarily attributable to the decreases in certain
    brokerage activities and the closure of a plastics processing
    facility.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

—  Revenues
    increased $117 million in 2008 and $37 million in 2007
    due to acquisitions, principally in the collection, transfer and
    recycling businesses, although we also made acquisitions in 2008
    in our “Other” business as we focus on entering new
    lines of business. Divestitures accounted for decreased revenues
    of $130 million in 2008 and $320 million in 2007.
    These divestitures were primarily comprised of collection
    operations and, to a lesser extent, transfer station and
    recycling operations. In the second, third and fourth quarters
    of 2008, revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded revenue
    declines from divestitures, a trend we had not seen in over two
    years. This change reflects (i) that there are less
    under-performing operations that are being considered for
    divestiture and (ii) the resulting shift of focus to
    accretive acquisitions.

Operating
    Expenses

Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related
    benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and
    repairs included below), which include salaries and wages,
    bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and
    the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and
    disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party
    disposal facilities and transfer stations;
    (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment,
    vehicles and facilities and related labor costs;
    (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of
    independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to
    disposal facilities and are driven by variables such as volumes,
    distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which
    are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with
    recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the
    costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill
    operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and
    taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees,
    host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill
    operating costs, which include interest accretion on asset
    retirement and environmental remediation obligations, leachate
    and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs
    and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs,
    which include workers’ compensation and insurance and claim
    costs and (x) other operating costs, which include, among
    other costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes.

The changes in our operating expenses for 2008 and 2007 compared
    with the prior years can largely be attributed to the following:

•

Volume declines and divestitures —

In both 2008
    and 2007, we experienced volume declines as a result of
    (i) the weakening economy; (ii) our focus on our
    pricing program and shedding unprofitable business; and
    (iii) divestitures. We continue to manage our fixed costs
    and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines,
    and have achieved significant cost savings as a result. These
    cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost
    categories identified in the table above.

•

Acquisitions and growth initiatives —

During
    2008, a significant portion of the cost savings derived from
    divestitures was offset by cost increases attributed to recently
    acquired businesses and, to a lesser extent, other growth
    initiatives.

•

Fuel price increases —

In each year, increased
    fuel costs have increased our operating expenses and negatively
    affected our operating margins. Diesel fuel prices varied
    significantly in 2008, reaching a record-high price of
    $4.76 per gallon in July and falling to a three-year low of
    $2.33 per gallon by the end of the year. On average, diesel
    fuel prices increased 32% from $2.88 per gallon in 2007 to $3.81
    per gallon in 2008. For 2007, we experienced an average increase
    of $0.18 per gallon as compared with 2006, or almost 7%. Higher
    fuel costs caused increases in both our direct fuel costs and
    our subcontractor costs throughout 2008 and 2007. As disclosed
    in the

Operating Revenues

section above, we have a fuel
    surcharge program that is designed to recover our increased fuel
    costs. Although our fuel surcharge program is designed to
    respond to changes in the market price for fuel, there is an
    administrative delay between the time our fuel costs change and
    when we are able to make the corresponding change in our fuel
    surcharges. This delay negatively affected our ability to fully
    recover our cost increases in the first six months of 2008 as
    the increases in our fuel surcharges consistently lagged the
    sharp increases in fuel costs throughout the first half of the
    year. However, the cost of fuel declined during the last half of
    2008, allowing us to fully recover the fuel costs increase we
    incurred during the year.

•

Commodities markets —

Market prices for
    recyclable commodities increased significantly from 2006 to 2007
    and also continued to climb through most of 2008, resulting in
    higher costs of goods sold in both periods. However, during the
    fourth quarter of 2008, the market prices and demand for
    recyclable commodities declined sharply. The significant
    decrease in market prices during the fourth quarter of 2008 and
    significant decreases in our brokerage and recycling facility
    volumes during much of 2008 partially offset the effect of
    higher commodity prices on our cost of goods sold during the
    first three quarters of 2008.



•

Union-related labor issues

— Our 2008 operating
    expenses were significantly affected by a labor disruption
    associated with the renegotiation of a collective bargaining
    agreement in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the related agreement of
    the bargaining unit to withdraw from the underfunded Central
    States Pension Fund, which is discussed in Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. These activities increased
    the operating expenses of our Midwest Group by $32 million
    during the third and fourth quarters of 2008. Approximately
    $24 million of these costs have been included in the
    “Labor and related benefits” category,
    $21 million of which were associated with charges related
    to the bargaining unit agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them
    from the underfunded Central States Pension Fund. The remaining
    $8 million has been included in our “Other”
    category and was related to security and the deployment and
    lodging costs incurred for the Company’s replacement
    workers who were brought to Milwaukee from across the
    organization.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we incurred
    another $18 million in “Labor and related
    benefits” charges associated with the withdrawal of certain
    bargaining units in our Midwest and Eastern Groups from
    underfunded multi-employer pension plans.

In 2007, our Western Group incurred “Other” operating
    expenses of $33 million for security, labor, lodging,
    travel and other costs incurred as a result of labor disruptions
    in Oakland and Los Angeles, California.

•

Changes in risk-free interest rates

— We
    recognized a $33 million charge to landfill operating costs
    during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to a sharp decline in
    United States Treasury rates, which are used to estimate the
    present value of our environmental remediation obligations.
    During the fourth quarter of 2008, the discount rate used was
    reduced from 4.00% to 2.25%. During 2007, we recorded an
    $8 million charge to reduce the discount rate from 4.75% to
    4.00% and during 2006 we recorded a $6 million decrease in
    expense to reflect an increase in the rate from 4.25% to 4.75%.

Many of the cost increases summarized above are due to general
    economic and market conditions over which we have little or no
    control. After considering the significant impacts of
    market-driven factors, we are encouraged that our results
    continue to reflect our focus on (i) identifying
    operational efficiencies that translate into cost savings;
    (ii) managing our fixed costs and reducing our variable
    costs as volumes decline due to our pricing program and the
    downturn in the economy; and (iii) reducing our costs in
    light of recent divestitures.

Other items affecting the comparability of our operating
    expenses by category for the three years presented include the
    following:

Labor and
    related benefits

•

In each year, wages increased due to annual merit adjustments,
    although these higher costs have been more than offset by
    headcount reductions due to operational efficiencies and
    divestitures.

•

We experienced additional overtime and other labor costs due to
    severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of
    2008 in our Midwest Group.

•

Our accrued bonus expenses were lower in 2008 because our
    performance against targets established by our incentive plans
    was not as strong as it had been in either 2007 or 2006.

Transfer
    and disposal costs

•

During 2008 and 2007, these costs decreased due to volume
    declines and divestitures.

•

During 2008 and 2007, these costs further decreased due to our
    focus on improving internalization.

Disposal
    and franchise fees and taxes

•

The favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern
    Group reduced these expenses by $18 million during 2007 and
    $3 million during 2008.

Landfill
    operating costs

•

In 2008, these costs included the unfavorable impact of the
    January 1, 2008 adoption of SFAS No. 157, which
    resulted in a $6 million charge.



•

During 2007, we recognized an $8 million charge for a
    revision in our estimate of remediation costs associated with
    one of our prior operations.

Risk
    management

•

Over the last three years, we have been successful in reducing
    these costs, which can be primarily attributed to our continued
    focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates.

•

For 2008, the decrease in expense was largely associated with
    reduced actuarial projections of workers’ compensation
    costs and reduced auto and general liability claims for current
    claim periods.

•

For 2007, the decrease in expense was largely associated with
    reduced actuarial projections of auto and general liability
    claims and, to a lesser extent, reduced workers’
    compensation costs, all primarily related to prior claim periods.

Other

•

In 2007, we incurred $21 million of lease termination costs
    associated with the purchase of one of our independent power
    production plants that had previously been operated through a
    lease agreement.

•

In 2008 and 2007, we had an increase in gains recognized on the
    sales of assets due to our focus on identifying under-utilized
    assets in order to increase our efficiency.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
    (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related
    insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and
    equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which
    include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services;
    (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances
    for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and
    (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which
    include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and
    data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment,
    rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial
    impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our
    “other” selling, general and administrative expenses.

A significant portion of the $45 million increase in our
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in 2008
    was as a result of our focus on business development
    initiatives, including gaining new customers and entering new
    lines of business. We estimate that these initiatives increased
    our expenses by nearly $19 million when comparing 2008 with
    2007. Approximately $8 million of the $19 million
    increase is associated with increased consulting costs and has
    been included in “Professional fees.” The remaining
    cost increases can generally be attributed to increased
    headcount, advertising and travel and entertainment costs.

Other significant changes in our selling, general and
    administrative expenses during the reported periods are
    summarized below:

Labor and related benefits

— The increases in
    2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to (i) higher
    salaries and hourly wages due to merit raises; (ii) higher
    compensation costs due to an increase in headcount driven by an
    increase in the size of our sales force and our focus on our
    people and business development initiatives; and
    (iii) higher non-cash compensation costs associated with
    the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term
    incentive plans. In 2008, we also experienced higher insurance
    and benefit costs. These increases were



partially offset by lower bonus expenses accrued in 2008 because
    our performance against targets established by our incentive
    plan was not as strong as it had been in either 2007 or 2006.

Professional fees

— We incurred significant
    costs in both 2008 and 2007 that are of a non-recurring nature.
    In 2008, we incurred over $7 million of legal and
    consulting costs to support our previously proposed acquisition
    of Republic Services, Inc. In 2007, our consulting fees were
    higher due to increased spending for various strategic
    initiatives, including the support and development of the SAP
    waste and recycling revenue management system, which we
    discontinued development of in early 2008. For information
    related to the current status of our pending litigation against
    SAP, refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Provision for bad debts

— The increase in our
    provision for bad debts in 2008 is due to the effects of the
    weakened economy, which has increased collection risks
    associated with certain customers.

Other

— As discussed above, our continued focus
    on our sales, marketing and other initiatives and identifying
    new customers resulted in increases in our advertising costs and
    travel and entertainment costs in 2008. The comparability of
    these costs for the periods presented has also been affected by
    net charges of approximately $2 million in 2007 and
    $20 million in 2006 to record our estimated obligations for
    unclaimed property. Additionally, in both 2007 and 2006, our
    other costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs
    and higher travel and entertainment costs due partially to the
    development of our revenue management system and our efforts to
    implement various initiatives.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of
    property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital
    leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years;
    (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those
    incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill
    development, construction, asset retirement costs arising from
    closure and post-closure, on a

units-of-consumption

method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated
    remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site;
    (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs
    arising from final capping obligations on a

units-of-consumption

method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity
    associated with each final capping event; and
    (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite
    life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a
    straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related
    agreements, which are generally from two to ten years depending
    on the type of asset.

In both 2008 and 2007, the decrease in depreciation on tangible
    property and equipment is largely due to (i) components of
    enterprise-wide software becoming fully-depreciated; and
    (ii) our focus on identifying operational efficiencies as
    we shed unprofitable business, which has allowed us to retire or
    sell under-utilized assets.

The decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in
    2008 and 2007 is largely due to volume declines as a result of
    (i) the slowdown in the economy; (ii) our pricing
    program, which has significantly reduced our collection volumes;
    and (iii) the redirection of waste to third-party disposal
    facilities in certain regions due to either the closure of our
    own landfills or the current capacity constraints of landfills
    where we are working on procuring an expansion permit. The
    comparability of our amortization of landfill airspace for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 has also been
    affected by adjustments recorded in each year for changes in
    estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006, landfill amortization expense was reduced by
    $3 million, $17 million and $1 million,
    respectively, for the effects of these



changes in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced
    expense resulting from the revised estimates was associated with
    final capping changes that were generally the result of
    (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies
    of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed
    us to delay spending for final capping activities;
    (ii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or
    deferred final capping costs; or (iii) completed final
    capping construction that cost less than anticipated.

Restructuring

Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if
    we are operating under the most advantageous structure. As
    discussed in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, in February 2009 we announced that we were taking
    steps to streamline our organization by consolidating many of
    our Market Areas and realigning our Corporate support
    organization. In 2008, we recognized $2 million of
    restructuring expenses for the reorganization of customer
    service functions in our Western Group and the realignment of
    certain operations in our Southern Group. In the first quarter
    of 2007, we restructured certain operations and functions,
    resulting in the recognition of a charge of approximately
    $9 million. We incurred an additional $1 million of
    costs for this restructuring during the second quarter of 2007,
    increasing total costs incurred to $10 million.
    Approximately $7 million of the 2007 restructuring costs
    was incurred by our Corporate organization, $2 million was
    incurred by our Midwest Group and $1 million was incurred
    by our Western Group. These charges included approximately
    $8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and
    approximately $2 million related to operating lease
    agreements.

The most significant cost savings we have obtained through these
    restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related
    benefits component of our “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses.

(Income) expense from divestitures (including

held-for-sale

impairments)

— The net gains from divestitures in
    all three years were a result of our

fix-or-seek-exit

initiative. In 2008, these gains were primarily related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our
    Southern Group; in 2007, the gains were related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection, transfer and
    recycling operations in our Eastern, Western, Southern and WMRA
    Groups; and in 2006, the gains were primarily related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our
    Western Group. Gains recognized from divestitures in 2006 were
    partially offset by the recognition of aggregate impairment
    charges of $18 million, which were principally recognized
    by our Eastern Group, for business operations held for sale as
    required by SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.

Impairments of assets

held-for-use

—
    During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge
    primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our
    Southern Group. During 2007, we recognized $12 million in
    impairment charges due to impairments recognized for two
    landfills in our Southern Group. The impairments were necessary
    as a result of the re-evaluation of our business alternatives
    for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had
    expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to
    the volumes for the second landfill. The $24 million of
    impairment charges recognized during 2006 was primarily related
    to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result
    of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the
    impairment of under-performing operations in our WMRA Group.



Other

— In 2006, we recognized a
    $26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration ruling
    against us related to the termination of a joint venture
    relationship in 2000.

Operating segments

— The most significant items
    affecting the results of operations of our geographic operating
    segments during the three-year period ended December 31,
    2008, are (i) increased revenue from yield on base business
    as a result of our pricing strategies, particularly in our
    collection operations; (ii) declines in revenues due to
    lower volumes, which can be attributed to pricing competition,
    the significant downturn in construction and the slowdown of the
    general economy; and (iii) our continued focus on
    controlling costs through operating efficiencies. For the first
    nine months of 2008, our Groups also experienced an unfavorable
    effect on operating income of significantly higher fuel costs.
    However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, fuel costs decreased
    significantly enough to reverse this trend, resulting in an
    immaterial impact to the full year. See additional discussion in
    the

Operating Revenues

section above.

Summarized below are the other significant items specific to
    each operating segment’s results of operations for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006:

Eastern

— The Group’s operating income for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 was negatively affected by
    a $14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain
    collective bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer
    pension plans. This charge was offset, in part, by a reduction
    in landfill amortization expense as a result of changes in
    certain estimates related to our final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations. The Group’s operating income for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 was favorably affected by
    (i) net divestiture gains of $33 million; (ii) an
    $18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the
    favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter; and (iii) a
    reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of
    changes in certain estimates related to our final capping,
    closure and post-closure obligations. The Group’s operating
    income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively
    affected by $26 million in impairment charges associated
    with (i) businesses being sold as part of our divestiture
    program; and (ii) a change in our expectations for future
    operations of a landfill. In 2006, the Group also incurred
    $14 million of strike-related costs incurred primarily in
    the New York City area.

Midwest

— The Group’s 2008 operating
    results were negatively affected by $44 million of
    additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of
    a labor dispute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Included in the labor
    dispute expenses is a $32 million charge related to the
    withdrawal of certain of the Group’s bargaining units from
    underfunded multi-employer pension plans. In addition, the Group
    experienced unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter
    of 2008. Positively affecting operating results both in 2008 and
    in 2007



were divestiture gains of $4 million in 2008 and
    $1 million in 2007 and reductions in landfill amortization
    expense resulting from changes in certain estimates related to
    our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.

Southern

— During 2008, the increase in the
    Group’s operating income is largely due to $29 million
    of divestiture gains, offset, in part, by a $3 million
    landfill impairment charge. During 2007, the Group recorded
    $12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of
    its landfills. These charges were largely offset by gains on
    divestitures of $11 million.

Western

— The Group’s 2008 operating
    results were negatively affected by an increase in landfill
    amortization expense as a result of changes in certain estimates
    related to our final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations. In 2007, labor disputes negatively affected the
    Group’s operating results by $37 million, principally
    as a result of “Operating” expenses incurred for
    security, deployment and lodging costs for replacement workers.
    Gains on divestitures of operations were $16 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared with
    $48 million for 2006.

Wheelabrator

— The Group’s 2008 operating
    results were favorably affected by increases in market rates for
    energy during the second half of 2008. The decline in operating
    income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by a
    $21 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007
    for the early termination of a lease agreement. The early
    termination was due to the Group’s purchase of an
    independent power production plant that it had previously
    operated through a lease agreement. Additionally, the
    termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in May
    2007 resulted in a decline in revenue and operating income
    compared with the prior year.

WMRA

— During the first nine months of 2008 and
    throughout all of 2007, the Group’s operating income
    benefited from substantial increases in market prices for
    commodities. Also during these periods, the Group experienced
    income growth due to an increased focus on maintaining or
    reducing rebates made to suppliers. During the fourth quarter of
    2008, however, commodity prices dropped sharply as a result of a
    significant decrease in the demand for commodities both
    domestically and internationally. This significant decline in
    commodity prices resulted in operating losses that more than
    offset the income generated during the first nine months of the
    year. Higher than normal operating expenses, including higher
    subcontractor, repair and maintenance, and facility

start-up

costs, also negatively affected the Group’s operating
    income throughout 2008. The comparison of the Group’s
    operating income for the periods presented has also been
    affected by (i) $7 million of net gains on
    divestitures in 2007 and (ii) the recognition in 2006 of
    $10 million of charges for a loss from a divestiture and an
    impairment of certain under-performing operations, which were
    slightly more than offset by savings associated with the
    Group’s cost control efforts.

Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining
    components of our results of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized below:

Other

— The unfavorable change in operating
    results in 2008 when compared with 2007 is the result of costs
    being incurred to support our increased focus on the
    identification and development of new lines of business that
    will complement our core business. The unfavorable change in
    operating results in 2007 when compared with 2006 is largely
    related to (i) certain year-end adjustments recorded in
    consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not
    included in the measure of segment income from operations used
    to assess their performance for the periods disclosed; and
    (ii) the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in
    April 2006.

Corporate and Other

— The decline in expenses
    in 2008 as compared with 2007 was primarily due to:

•

lower bonus expense in 2008;

•

the recognition of approximately $6 million of
    restructuring charges during the first quarter of 2007 for
    employee severance and benefit costs;

•

reduced risk management costs in 2008, which is attributable to
    reduced actuarial projections of claim losses for workers’
    compensation and auto and general liability claims; and

•

higher employee healthcare coverage expenses in the third
    quarter of 2007 due to unusually high claims activity.



The expense declines noted above were largely offset by the
    impacts of the following:

•

a $32 million charge to landfill operating costs for the
    closed landfills that are managed by our closed sites management
    group through our Corporate organization, due to a sharp decline
    in United States Treasury rates in late 2008, which caused an
    increase in the present value of our environmental remediation
    obligations; and

• costs incurred for the potential acquisition of
    Republic during the third quarter of 2008.

The decline in expenses when comparing 2007 with 2006 was
    primarily due to:

• significantly lower risk management costs largely
    due to our focus on safety and controlling costs;

•

a reduction in expenses from the discontinuation of depreciation
    for certain enterprise-wide software; and

•

a $20 million charge recorded in 2006 to recognize
    unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property.

The expense declines noted above were offset, in part, by the
    impacts of the following:

•

increased spending on the support and development of our
    information technology, people and pricing strategic initiatives;

•

increased labor and related benefits costs; and

•

restructuring charges recognized during the first quarter of
    2007.

    Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion
    of the relationship between current year and prior year activity.

Interest
    Expense

Although our outstanding debt balances are relatively consistent

year-over-year,

the decline in interest costs when comparing 2008 with 2007 is
    generally related to (i) the maturity of higher rate debt
    that we have refinanced at lower interest rates;
    (ii) significant declines in market interest rates, which
    impact the interest expense associated with our interest rate
    swaps and our variable rate debt; and (iii) the early
    redemption of $244 million of 8.75% senior notes
    during the second quarter of 2008, which resulted in the
    recognition of a reduction in interest expense of approximately
    $10 million for the immediate recognition of fair value
    adjustments associated with terminated interest rate swaps that
    had been deferred and were being amortized over the life of the
    debt. The decrease in interest expense when comparing 2007 with
    2006 is largely related to a decrease in our average debt
    balances.

We use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure
    to changes in market interest rates. The combined impact of
    active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in
    a net interest expense decrease of $50 million for 2008 and
    net interest expense increases of $11 million for 2007 and
    $4 million for 2006. Our active interest rate swaps
    decreased our interest expense in 2008 by $8 million
    compared with an increase in interest expense in 2007 from
    active hedges of $48 million. The significant change in the
    impact of our active interest rate swaps when comparing 2008
    with 2007 has been driven by the decrease in short-term market
    interest rates, which



drive our periodic interest obligations under our active swap
    agreements. Our periodic interest obligations under these
    agreements are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR,
    which was as low as 1.43% in late 2008 and as high as 5.62% in
    the second half of 2007. In 2008, the

year-over-year

change in the impact of interest rate swaps is also due to our
    terminated swaps, which caused a $42 million reduction in
    interest expense in 2008 compared with a $37 million
    reduction in interest expense in 2007. Our terminated interest
    rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by
    $18 million in 2009, $11 million in 2010, and
    $5 million in 2011.

Interest
    Income

When comparing 2008 with 2007, the decrease in interest income
    is primarily due to (i) significant declines in market
    interest rates; (ii) the recognition of $7 million in
    interest income during the first quarter of 2007 for the
    favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern
    Group; and (iii) a decrease in our average cash and
    investment balances. When comparing 2007 with 2006, the decrease
    in interest income is primarily due to (i) a decrease in
    our average cash and investment balances; and
    (ii) $14 million of interest income realized in 2006
    on tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of
    several federal audits.

Equity
    in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities

During the reported periods, our “Equity in net losses of
    unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our
    equity interests in two coal-based synthetic fuel production
    facilities. The equity losses generated by the facilities were
    offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these
    investments as discussed below within

Provision for income
    taxes.

Our equity in the losses of these facilities was $3 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008, $42 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 and $41 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. The significant decline
    in these losses in 2008 as compared with the prior year periods
    is due to the expiration of our investments at the end of 2007.
    The comparability of the losses incurred in 2007 and 2006 is
    primarily affected by (i) the impact of the partial
    phase-out of Section 45K credits during each year on our
    contractual obligations associated with funding the
    facilities’ losses; (ii) the temporary suspension of
    operations at the facilities in 2006; and (iii) the
    recognition of a cumulative adjustment necessary to
    appropriately reflect our

life-to-date

obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and
    the value of our investment, which was recognized in 2006. Refer
    to Note 8 for additional information related to the impact
    of these investments.

Minority
    Interest

On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two limited liability
    companies that own three

waste-to-energy

facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group as a result of our
    implementation of FIN 46(R). Our minority interest expense
    for 2008, 2007 and 2006 is primarily related to the other
    members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities.
    Additional information related to these investments is included
    in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

We recorded a provision for income taxes of $669 million in
    2008, $540 million in 2007 and $325 million in 2006.
    These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of
    approximately 38.1%, 31.7% and 22.1% for each of the three
    years, respectively. At current income levels, we expect that
    our 2009 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 40%.
    The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is primarily
    affected by (i) increases in our income before taxes;
    (ii) differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements;
    and (iii) the impact of non-conventional fuel tax credits,
    which expired at the end of 2007. The impacts of tax audit
    settlements and non-conventional fuel tax credits, which are the
    items that had the most significant impacts on the comparability
    of our effective tax rate during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, are summarized below:

•

Tax audit settlements

— When excluding the
    effect of interest income, the settlement of various tax audits
    resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of
    $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    (representing a 1.5 percentage point reduction in our
    effective tax rate), $40 million for the year ended



December 31, 2007 (representing a 2.3 percentage point
    reduction in our effective tax rate) and $149 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 (representing a
    10.1 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate).

•

Non-conventional fuel tax credits

— Through
    December 31, 2007, non-conventional fuel tax credits were
    derived from our landfills and our investments in the two
    coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities discussed in
    the

Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities

section above. Pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal
    Revenue Code, these tax credits were phased-out if the price of
    oil exceeded an annual average as determined by the IRS. Based
    on an estimated phase-out of 69% of Section 45K tax credits
    generated during 2007, our income taxes for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 included $50 million of
    non-conventional fuel tax credits. These tax credits resulted in
    a 2.9 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate
    for the year ended December 31, 2007. In April 2008, the
    IRS published the phase-out percentage that must be applied to
    Section 45K tax credits generated in 2007, which was 67.2%.
    Our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2008
    included an adjustment of our 2007 year-end estimate to the
    final 2007 phase-out, which resulted in the recognition of a
    $3 million benefit. Our income taxes for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 included $71 million of
    non-conventional fuel tax credits, resulting in a
    4.8 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate.
    Non-conventional fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2007
    pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code.

Other items that have affected our reported income taxes during
    the reported periods include the following:

•

Canadian tax rate changes and the related revaluation of
    deferred tax balances resulted in a $30 million tax benefit
    during 2007 compared with a $20 million tax benefit in
    2006. We did not have any comparable adjustments during the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

•

We recorded reductions to income tax expense of $8 million
    in 2008, $9 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006
    due to state-related tax items. These impacts were generally due
    to either (i) the revaluation of net accumulated deferred
    tax liabilities as a result of a decrease in our effective state
    tax rate or (ii) the expected utilization of state net
    operating loss and credit carryforwards.

Landfill
    and Environmental Remediation Discussion and

Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31,
    2008 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average
    remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated
    landfills is approximately 32 years. Many of our landfills
    have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is
    currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted
    disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether
    to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated
    future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking
    expansion permits at 42 of our landfills that meet the expansion
    criteria outlined in the

Critical Accounting Estimates and
    Assumptions

section above. Although no assurances can be
    made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted
    as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for
    all owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years
    when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume.



The number of landfills we own or operate as of
    December 31, 2008, segregated by their estimated operating
    lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows:

(a)

From an operating perspective, landfills we operate through
    lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own
    the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the
    landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the
    life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the closure
    and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease.

(b)

For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and
    we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the
    life of the landfill. The property owner is generally
    responsible for closure and post-closure obligations under our
    operating contracts.

The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace

In 2008, we acquired five landfills, closed five landfills and
    discontinued operations at four landfills.

(b)

These amounts include 2.0 million tons at December 31,
    2008 and 2.4 million tons at December 31, 2007 that
    were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial
    purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted
    airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are
    frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for
    composting and clean dirt for

on-site

construction projects.

When a landfill we own or operate (i) reaches its permitted
    waste capacity; (ii) is permanently capped; and
    (iii) receives certification of closure from the applicable
    regulatory agency, management of the site, including remediation
    activities, is generally transferred to our closed sites
    management group. In addition to the 273 active landfills we
    managed at December 31, 2008, we managed 195 closed
    landfills.

Landfill Assets

— We capitalize various costs
    that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept waste. These
    costs generally include expenditures for land (including the
    landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property),
    permitting, excavation, liner material and installation,
    landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection
    systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and
    landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized
    interest, and

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future
    costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.

The following table reflects the total cost basis of our
    landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization
    as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and summarizes
    significant changes in these amounts during 2008 (in millions):

As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that we will spend
    approximately $500 million in 2009, and approximately
    $1 billion in 2010 and 2011 combined for the construction
    and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of
    landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and
    spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in
    landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements
    and other factors impacting landfill operations.



Landfill and Environmental Remediation
    Liabilities

— As we accept waste at our landfills,
    we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include
    liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations

and its Interpretations, and are
    discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of
    properties that have incurred environmental damage, which
    generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by
    conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site.
    We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we
    determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost
    for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated.

The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our
    environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and summarizes significant changes in these
    amounts during 2008 (in millions):

(a)

The significant increase in our environmental remediation
    liabilities for revisions in cost estimates and interest rate
    assumptions is largely related to the decline in the risk-free
    discount rate used to estimate the present value of the
    obligations. The impact of this revision in estimate is
    discussed further below.

Landfill Costs and Expenses

— As disclosed in
    the

Operating Expenses

section above, our landfill
    operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement
    obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments
    to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets,
    leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill
    remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following
    table summarizes these costs for each of the three years
    indicated (in millions):

$


$


$


The increase in these costs in 2008 can largely be attributed to
    a significant decline in the risk-free discount rate that we use
    to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation
    liabilities, which is based on the rate for United States
    Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted-average
    period until settlement of the underlying obligations. During
    the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a $33 million
    charge to “Operating” expenses, offset in part by a
    $6 million reduction in “Minority interest”
    expense, to reduce the discount rate from 4.00% to 2.25%. We
    recorded an $8 million charge to “Operating”
    expenses during the fourth quarter of 2007 to reduce the
    discount rate from 4.75% to 4.00% and a $6 million decrease
    in “Operating” expenses during the fourth quarter of
    2006 to increase the discount rate from 4.25% to 4.75%.
    Additionally, in 2008, our leachate collection costs were higher
    in our Eastern Group and Midwest Group due to increased
    precipitation and operational changes in these regions.



Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a
    component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense,
    includes the following:

•

the amortization of landfill capital costs, including
    (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and
    (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and
    construction required to develop our landfills to their
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and

•

the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill
    final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including
    (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and
    (ii) projected asset retirement costs.

Amortization expense is recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is
    calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis
    of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the
    corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and
    closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally
    incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its
    entire operating life, and are, therefore, amortized on a per
    ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final
    capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific
    final capping event, and are, therefore, amortized on a per ton
    basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated
    airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per
    ton amortization rates.

The following table calculates our landfill airspace
    amortization expense on a per ton basis:

Years Ended December 31,

$


$


$


Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)




Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton

$

4.01

$

3.86

$

3.80

Different per ton amortization rates are applied at each of our
    273 landfills, and per ton amortization rates vary
    significantly from one landfill to the next due to
    (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs
    and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for
    landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost
    basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire.
    Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured
    on a per ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of
    volumes received across the Company

year-over-year.

The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace
    amortization expense per ton for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 has also been affected by
    the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for
    changes in our estimates related to our final capping, closure
    and post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was
    reduced by $3 million in 2008, $17 million in 2007 and
    $1 million in 2006, for the effects of these changes in
    estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense
    resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final
    capping events that were generally the result of
    (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies
    of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed
    us to delay spending for final capping activities;
    (ii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or
    deferred final capping costs; or (iii) completed final
    capping construction that cost less than anticipated.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our
    liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our
    present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may
    arise during the year as a result of changing business
    conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working
    capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
    ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
    construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
    to and maintenance of our trucking fleet;
    (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at

waste-to-energy

and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and
    equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and
    post-closure activities at our landfills; and (vi) repaying
    debt and discharging other obligations. We also are committed to
    providing our shareholders with a return on their investment
    through our capital allocation program that provides for
    dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in
    acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide
    continued growth in our business.

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money
    market funds that invest in United States government
    obligations, all of which have original maturities of three
    months or less.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

—
    Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds
    held in trust for the construction of various facilities or
    repayment of our debt obligations, funds deposited for purposes
    of settling landfill closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These
    balances are primarily included within long-term “Other
    assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    discussion.

Debt

— We use long-term borrowings in addition
    to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall
    financial strategy to support and grow our business. We
    primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a
    long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities
    when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as
    of December 31, 2008 are described in Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31,
    2007 to December 31, 2008 can primarily be attributed to
    (i) net debt repayments of $260 million;
    (ii) non-cash proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of
    principal payments made directly from trust funds of
    $169 million; (iii) a $78 million increase in the
    carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest
    rate swaps; and (iv) the impacts of accounting for other
    non-cash changes in our balances due to foreign currency
    translation, interest and capital leases.

We have approximately $1.2 billion of scheduled debt
    maturities during the next twelve months. We have classified
    approximately $509 million of these borrowings as long-term
    as of December 31, 2008 based on our intent and ability to
    refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis.



We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and
    financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating
    cash flows for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below:

•

Earnings decline

— Our income from operations,
    net of depreciation and amortization, decreased by
    $41 million, on a

year-over-year

basis, which negatively affected our cash flow from operations
    in 2008.

•

Receivables

— The change in our trade
    receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and
    divestitures, provided a source of cash of approximately
    $185 million in 2008. In 2008, our receivables balances
    declined primarily due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues
    as compared with the prior year, but also due to improved
    efficiency of collections. Additionally, during the third
    quarter of 2008, we collected an outstanding receivable related
    to our investments in the synthetic fuel production facilities
    that provided us with Section 45K tax credits through 2007.
    Approximately $60 million of the cash we received
    represented amounts that we paid to the facilities during 2006
    and 2007 for which we did not ultimately realize a tax benefit,
    and was reflected as an operating cash inflow.

•

Increased income tax payments

— Cash paid for
    income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with
    equity-based transactions, was approximately $170 million
    higher on a

year-over-year

basis, due in large part to an increase in both our taxable
    income and our effective tax rate. The comparability of our 2008
    and



2007 effective tax rates is discussed in the

Provision for
    income taxes

section above. In addition, the overpayment of
    income taxes in 2006 reduced our 2007 tax payments.

•

Decreased interest payments

— Cash paid
    for interest was approximately $65 million lower on a

year-over-year

basis. This decline is due primarily to a decline in our
    weighted average borrowing rate, which can be attributed to the
    maturity of higher rate debt that we refinanced at lower rates
    and a decline in market rates.

•

Accounts payable processes

— In 2008, we
    began various initiatives to improve our working capital
    management, including reviewing our accounts payable process to
    ensure vendor payments are made on a basis that results in more
    optimal cash management. The changes made to the timing of our
    vendor payments favorably impacted our cash flow from operations
    on a

year-over-year

basis by approximately $30 million.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    operating cash flows for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below:

•

Earnings improvements

— Our income from
    operations, net of depreciation and amortization, increased by
    $150 million, on a

year-over-year

basis, which positively affected our cash flows from operations
    in 2007.

•

Decreased income tax payments and refunds —

Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits
    associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately
    $80 million lower on a

year-over-year

basis, largely due to excess tax payments in 2006, which reduced
    our estimated tax payment made in the third quarter of 2007.
    Cash tax refunds attributable to audit settlements decreased by
    approximately $40 million on a

year-over-year

basis.

•

Risk management assets and liabilities —

During
    2007, we were able to reduce risk management liabilities by
    approximately $80 million, primarily as a result of reduced
    actuarial projections of claim losses for auto and general
    liability and worker’s compensation claims, which was
    attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident
    and injury rates. While this non-cash reserve reduction had a
    positive impact on income from operations, it did not have a
    significant impact on our cash flow from operations.

•

Trade receivables —

The change in our
    receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and
    divestitures, negatively affected the comparison of our cash
    flows from operations by approximately $70 million. This
    decline is primarily attributable to increased trade receivables
    when comparing 2007 and 2006 as compared to decreased trade
    receivables when comparing 2006 to 2005.

•

Increased bonus payments —

Our bonus payments
    for 2006, which were paid in the first quarter of 2007, were
    higher than bonus payments for 2005 paid in 2006 due to the
    relative strength of our financial performance against incentive
    plan measures in 2006 as compared with 2005. The comparative
    changes in our liabilities for bonuses negatively affected the
    comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately
    $60 million.

•

Liabilities for unclaimed property

— In
    2007, we made significant cash payments for our obligations
    associated with unclaimed property, reducing our liabilities. In
    2006, our liabilities for unclaimed property increased,
    primarily due to the charge to earnings required to fully record
    our obligations. The changes in our recorded obligations for
    unclaimed property negatively affected the comparison of our
    cash flow from operations by approximately $30 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Cash paid for acquisitions —

Our spending on
    acquisitions increased from $32 million during 2006 to
    $90 million during 2007 and $280 million in 2008 due
    to an increased focus on accretive acquisitions and other
    investments that will contribute to improved future results of
    operations and enhance and expand our existing service offerings.

•

Proceeds from divestitures —

Proceeds from
    divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets
    were $112 million in 2008, $278 million in 2007 and
    $240 million in 2006. Our proceeds from divestitures for
    all three years have been driven by the divestiture of
    under-performing and non-strategic operations. The



decrease in proceeds from divestitures in 2008 was largely a
    result of having fewer underperforming operations to sell as
    part of our

fix-or-seek-exit

initiative.

•

Capital expenditures —

We used
    $1,221 million during 2008 for capital expenditures,
    compared with $1,211 million in 2007 and
    $1,329 million in 2006. Capital expenditures in 2006 were
    higher than either 2007 or 2008 due to relatively high levels of
    fleet capital spending done in advance of significant mandated
    changes in heavy-duty truck engines beginning in January 2007.

•

Purchases and sales of short-term investments —

Net sales of short-term investments provided
    $184 million of cash in 2007, compared with
    $122 million during 2006. We used proceeds from the sale of
    our short-term investments to provide cash that we used to fund
    our common stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt
    repayments, which are discussed below. We did not hold any
    short-term investments during 2008.

•

Net receipts from restricted funds —

Net funds
    received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which
    are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for
    our capital needs, contributed $178 million to our
    investing activities in 2008 compared with $120 million in
    2007 and $253 million in 2006.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Share repurchases and dividend payments —

Our
    2008, 2007 and 2006 share repurchases and dividend payments
    have been made in accordance with capital allocation programs
    approved by our Board of Directors.

We paid $410 million for share repurchases in 2008 as
    compared with $1,421 million in 2007 and
    $1,072 million in 2006. We repurchased approximately
    12 million, 40 million and 31 million shares of
    our common stock in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    significant decline in share repurchases during 2008 is largely
    attributable to the suspension of our share repurchases in
    connection with our proposal to acquire all of the outstanding
    stock of Republic Services, Inc. When the proposal was withdrawn
    in October 2008, we determined that, given the state of the
    financial markets, it would be prudent to suspend repurchases
    for the foreseeable future.

We paid an aggregate of $531 million in cash dividends
    during 2008 compared with $495 million in 2007 and
    $476 million in 2006. The increase in dividend payments is
    due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.22 in
    2006, to $0.24 in 2007 and to $0.27 in 2008. The impact of the

year-over-year

increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by
    a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result
    of our share repurchase program.

In December 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new capital
    allocation program that includes the authorization for up to
    $1.3 billion in combined cash dividends, common stock
    repurchases, debt reduction and acquisitions in 2009. At this
    time, the Board of Directors also announced that it expects
    future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.29 per share. All
    future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board
    of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net
    earnings, financial condition, cash required for future
    prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant.

•

Proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of options and
    warrants —

The exercise of common stock options
    and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a
    total of $44 million of financing cash inflows during 2008
    compared with $168 million during 2007 and
    $340 million in 2006. We believe the relatively large
    impact of stock option and warrant exercises in 2006 was due to
    the substantial increase in the market value of our common stock
    during 2006 and the accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock
    options in December 2005 because the acceleration made
    additional options available for exercise.

Net debt repayments —

Net debt repayments were
    $260 million in 2008, $256 million in 2007 and
    $500 million in 2006. The following summarizes our most

This summary excludes the impacts of non-cash borrowings and
    debt repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, these non-cash financing activities were
    primarily associated with our tax-exempt bond financings.
    Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issuances, net of principal
    repayments made directly from trust funds, were
    $169 million in 2008, $144 million in 2007 and
    $157 million in 2006.

Accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash
    balances —

Changes in our accrued liabilities for
    checks written in excess of cash balances are reflected as
    “Other” financing activities in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows. There are significant changes in these
    accrued liability balances as of each year-end, which is
    generally attributable to the timing of cash deposits.

We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely.
    As a result, the impact of these contingencies has not been
    included in the above table. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    these contingencies.

Liquidity
    Impacts of Uncertain Tax Positions

As discussed in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax
    benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily
    included as a component of long-term “Other
    liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the
    Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the
    liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve
    months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would
    make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but
    do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations
    will materially affect our liquidity.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated
    entities as discussed in the

Guarantees

section of
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our
    third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to
    support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations.
    These arrangements have not materially affected our financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity during the year
    ended December 31, 2008 nor are they expected to have a
    material impact on our future financial position, results of
    operations or liquidity.



Seasonal
    Trends and Inflation

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
    during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
    and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
    trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
    that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
    the hurricanes generally experienced by our Southern Group, can
    actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However,
    for several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively
    lower margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the
    temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly
    affect the operating results of the affected regions. The
    operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher
    repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower
    winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
    fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we
    believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near
    future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on
    our results of operations. However, management’s estimates
    associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have,
    an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental
    remediation liabilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position

FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those
    that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
    Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008, we have not applied
    the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to our asset retirement
    obligations, which are accounted for under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 143. FSP

FAS 157-2

establishes January 1, 2009 as the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to these fair value
    measurements for the Company. We do not currently expect the
    application of the fair value framework established by
    SFAS No. 157 to non-financial assets and liabilities
    measured on a non-recurring basis to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements. However, we will continue
    to assess the potential effects of SFAS No. 157 as
    additional guidance becomes available.

SFAS No. 141(R) —
    Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

, which establishes
    principles for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in the
    financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the
    acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for recognizing
    and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination
    and determines what information to disclose to enable users of
    the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R)
    is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The
    portions of the statement that relate to business combinations
    completed before the effective date will not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, our
    adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will significantly impact
    our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions,
    principally as a result of (i) expanded requirements to
    value acquired assets, liabilities and contingencies at their
    fair values; and (ii) the requirement that
    acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be
    expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the
    cost of the acquisition.

SFAS No. 160 —
    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB
    No. 51

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It states that a noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
    consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the
    consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 will
    be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009 and
    must be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements, which must be applied



retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements. However, it could impact our
    accounting for future transactions.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market
    risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency
    rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use
    derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our
    derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that
    provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no
    multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2008, all of
    our derivative transactions were related to actual or
    anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did
    not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk
    in the event of non-performance by our derivative
    counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by
    regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of
    the counterparties, all of whom we either consider
    credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support
    their performance.

We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market
    rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk
    sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are
    inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical
    set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary
    significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market
    movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions
    and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity
    analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative
    of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the
    assumed market rate movements.

Interest Rate Exposure.

Our exposure to market
    risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt
    obligations, which are primarily denominated in
    U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to
    manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations,
    which directly impacts variability in interest costs. As of
    December 31, 2008, 33% of our total debt is at variable
    interest rates, compared with 34% at December 31, 2007. An
    instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates
    across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have
    decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate
    swap positions by approximately $595 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $445 million at
    December 31, 2007. As disclosed in Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, there have not been any
    material changes in the amount or type of debt or derivatives
    outstanding since December 31, 2007; nor has there been a
    material change in the extent of our exposure to variability in
    interest rates. Accordingly, the significant increase when
    comparing the effect of the one percentage point increase at
    December 31, 2008 with December 31, 2007 can be
    attributed to a substantial decline in risk-free interest rates,
    which are used in the discounted cash flow analysis performed to
    support this disclosure. This analysis does not reflect the
    effect that increasing interest rates would have on items other
    than our outstanding debt and interest rate derivatives, nor the
    unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash
    payments for interest.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have
    $381 million and $418 million of assets held in
    restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included
    within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    These assets are generally restricted for future capital
    expenditures and closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are,
    therefore, invested in high quality, liquid instruments
    including money market accounts and U.S. government agency
    debt securities. Because of the short terms to maturity of these
    investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair
    value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

Currency Rate Exposure.

From time to time, we
    have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of
    currency translation on cash flows of intercompany
    Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign
    currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial
    position or results of operations for the periods presented. In
    addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could
    significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency
    derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not
    have a material impact to the Company.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal
    controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to
    (i) the reliability of our financial reporting;
    (ii) the reliability of the preparation and presentation of
    the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States; and (iii) the safeguarding of assets from
    unauthorized use or disposition.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Through this
    evaluation, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our
    internal controls. There are inherent limitations in the
    effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
    reporting; however, based on our evaluation, we have concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Waste Management, Inc. at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007 the Company adopted
    Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)” and FASB
    Staff Position

No. FIN 48-1

“Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Waste
    Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 17, 2009 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Waste Management,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 17,
    2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006

1.

Business

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation;
    Waste Management’s wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which
    Waste Management or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary
    as described in Note 19. Waste Management is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries.
    When the terms “the Company,” “we,”
    “us” or “our” are used in this document,
    those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
    subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When
    we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to Waste
    Management, Inc., the parent holding company.

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and waste-to-energy services. In providing
    these services, we actively pursue projects and initiatives that
    we believe make a positive difference for our environment,
    including recovering and processing the methane gas produced
    naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source. Our
    customers include commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers, other waste management companies,
    electric utilities and governmental entities.

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through six
    operating Groups, of which four are organized by geographic area
    and two are organized by function. The geographic Groups include
    our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, and the two
    functional Groups are our Wheelabrator Group, which provides
    waste-to-energy services, and our WM Recycle America, or WMRA,
    Group, which provides recycling services not managed by our
    geographic Groups. We also provide additional waste management
    services that are not managed through our six Groups, which are
    presented in this report as “Other.” Refer to
    Note 20 for additional information related to our segments.

Accounting
    Changes and Reclassifications

Accounting
    Changes

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted
    SFAS No. 157 for assets and liabilities recognized at
    fair value on a recurring basis. Our adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 during the first quarter of 2008 resulted
    in the recognition of a $6 million charge to operating
    expenses and a corresponding $3 million credit to minority
    interest expense for the re-measurement of the fair value of
    environmental remediation recovery assets accounted for in
    accordance with Statement of Position

No. 96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities.

The adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 did not materially affect our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. Refer to Note 17 for information about our fair
    value measurements.

SFAS No. 158 —
    Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the
    overfunded or underfunded status of their defined benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans as an asset or liability
    and to recognize changes in that funded status through
    comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. As
    required, we adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS
    No. 158 on December 31, 2006.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31,
    2006, we recorded a liability and a corresponding deferred loss
    adjustment to “Accumulated other comprehensive income”
    of $2 million related to the previously unaccrued liability
    balance associated with unfunded benefit obligations in our
    defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The
    December 31, 2006 net increase of $1 million in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income” attributable
    to the underfunded status of our post-retirement plans is
    associated with the net impact of adjustments to increase
    deferred tax assets by $3 million, partially offset by the
    additional $2 million related to liabilities recorded.

SFAS No. 158 also requires companies to measure the
    funded status of defined benefit pension and other
    post-retirement plans as of their year-end reporting date. The
    measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 were
    effective for us as of December 31, 2008. We applied the
    measurement provisions by measuring our benefit obligations as
    of September 30, 2007, our prior measurement date, and
    recognizing a pro-rata share of net benefit costs for the
    transition period from October 1, 2007 to December 31,
    2008 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in
    retained earnings as of December 31, 2008. The adoption of
    the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 did
    not have a material impact on our financial position or results
    of operations for the periods presented.

FIN 48 —
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109)

. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement
    recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected
    to be taken in tax returns. In addition, FIN 48 provides
    guidance on the de-recognition, classification and disclosure of
    tax positions, as well as the accounting for related interest
    and penalties. On May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FSP

No. FIN 48-1,

Definition of

Settlement

in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48

, to provide guidance associated with the
    criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position
    has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax
    benefit.

Our adoption of FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1

effective January 1, 2007 resulted in the recognition of a
    $28 million increase in our liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits, a $32 million increase in our non-current
    deferred tax assets and a $4 million increase in our
    beginning retained earnings as a cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle.

Refer to Note 8 for additional information about our
    unrecognized tax benefits.

Reclassifications

Statements of Cash Flows —

As a result of an
    increase in the significance of certain non-cash expenses, we
    have elected to separately identify the effects of
    “Interest accretion on landfill liabilities,”
    “Interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to
    environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets”
    and “Equity-based compensation expense” within the
    “Cash flows from operating activities” section of our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We have made
    reclassifications in our 2007 and 2006 Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows to conform prior year information with our current
    period presentation.

Segments —

During the second quarter of 2008,
    we moved certain Canadian business operations from the Western
    Group to the Midwest Group to facilitate improved business
    execution. We have reflected the impact of this change for all
    periods presented to provide financial information that
    consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
    operations. Refer to Note 20 for further discussion about
    our reportable segments.

Certain other minor reclassifications have been made to our
    prior period consolidated financial information in order to
    conform to the current year presentation.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of WMI, its wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we
    have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All
    material intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities in which we do not have a
    controlling financial interest are accounted for under either
    the equity method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.

Estimates
    and assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
    with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting
    for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset
    impairments, and self-insurance reserves and recoveries. Each of
    these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual
    results could differ materially from the estimates and
    assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial
    statements.

Cash
    and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit
    and money market funds that invest in United States government
    obligations, all of which have original maturities of three
    months or less.

Concentrations
    of credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents, investments held within our trust funds and escrow
    accounts, accounts receivable and derivative instruments. We
    make efforts to control our exposure to credit risk associated
    with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other
    financial interests with a diverse group of credit-worthy
    financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial
    instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument;
    and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension
    that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring
    procedures, although generally we do not have collateral
    requirements. In addition, our overall credit risk associated
    with trade receivables is limited due to the large number of
    geographically diverse customers we service. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, no single customer represented
    greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.

Trade
    and other receivables

Our receivables are recorded when billed or when cash is
    advanced and represent claims against third parties that will be
    settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of
    the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated
    net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful
    accounts based on historical collection trends, type of
    customer, such as municipal or non-municipal, the age of
    outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions. If
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific
    receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is
    given to the collectibility of those balances and the allowance
    is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are
    written-off when our internal collection efforts have been
    unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Also, we recognize
    interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable
    as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes.

Landfill
    accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize
    various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept
    waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land
    (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer
    property), permitting, excavation, liner material and
    installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest, and

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future
    costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities in accordance with
    SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

and its Interpretations. These costs are
    discussed below.

Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

—
    Following is a description of our asset retirement activities
    and our related accounting:

•

Final Capping

— Involves the installation of
    flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage
    and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill
    where total airspace capacity has been consumed. Final capping
    asset retirement obligations are recorded on a
    units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed related to
    the specific final capping event with a corresponding increase
    in the landfill asset. Each final capping event is accounted for
    as a discrete obligation and recorded as an asset and a
    liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows and
    capacity associated with each final capping event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the
    final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required),
    demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs
    incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but before the
    landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state
    regulatory agency. These costs are accrued as an asset
    retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of
    the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Closure obligations are accrued over the life of the
    landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows
    associated with performing closure activities.

•

Post-Closure

— Involves the maintenance and
    monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by
    the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to
    maintain and monitor landfill sites for a

30-year

period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an
    asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the
    life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the
    landfill asset. Post-closure obligations are accrued over the
    life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash
    flows associated with performing post-closure activities.

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from
    our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our
    estimates are based on our interpretation of current
    requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to
    approximate fair value under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 143. Absent quoted market prices, the
    estimate of fair value should be based on the best available
    information, including the results of present value techniques.
    In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our
    obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use
    historical experience, professional engineering judgment and
    quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the
    fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize
    these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract
    with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those
    instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the
    incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component
    of operating income when the work is performed.

Additionally, an estimate of fair value also should include the
    price that marketplace participants are able to receive for
    bearing the uncertainties inherent in these cash flows. However,
    when using discounted cash flow techniques, reliable estimates
    of market premiums may not be obtainable. In the waste industry,
    there generally is not a market for selling the responsibility
    for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations
    independent of selling the landfill in its entirety.
    Accordingly, we do not believe that it is possible to develop a
    methodology to



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

reliably estimate a market risk premium and have excluded any
    such premium from our determination of expected cash flows for
    landfill asset retirement obligations.

Once we have determined the final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time
    of payment and discount those expected future costs back to
    present value. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, we inflated these costs in current dollars until the
    expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 2.5%. We
    discount these costs to present value using the credit-adjusted,
    risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred
    consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in
    expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated
    cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the
    current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the
    historical weighted-average rate of the recorded obligation. As
    a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to each
    individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted-average
    rate applicable to our asset retirement obligations at
    December 31, 2008 is between 6.00% and 7.25%, the range of
    the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rates effective since
    adopting SFAS No. 143 in 2003. We expect to apply a
    credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate of 8.00% to liabilities
    incurred in the first quarter of 2009.

We record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity
    consumed through the current period. The fair value of final
    capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the
    airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the
    expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of
    closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our
    estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire
    landfill and the expected timing of each closure and
    post-closure activity. Because these obligations are measured at
    estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in
    the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure
    and post-closure activities could result in a material change in
    these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We
    assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our
    recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts
    change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or
    extent of future final capping and closure and post-closure
    activities typically result in both (i) a current
    adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset; and
    (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded
    prospectively over either the remaining capacity of the related
    discrete final capping event or the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace (as defined below) of the landfill. Any
    changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the
    landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our
    amortization policy, which would generally result in
    amortization expense being recognized prospectively over the
    remaining capacity of the final capping event or the remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as
    appropriate. Changes in such estimates associated with airspace
    that has been fully utilized result in an adjustment to the
    recorded liability and landfill assets with an immediate
    corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace amortization
    expense.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the
    timing and cost of future final capping, closure and
    post-closure of fully utilized airspace resulted in
    $3 million, $17 million and $1 million in net
    credits to landfill airspace amortization expense, respectively,
    with the majority of these credits resulting from revised
    estimates associated with final capping changes. In managing our
    landfills, our engineers look for ways to reduce or defer our
    construction costs, including final capping costs. The benefit
    recognized in these years was generally the result of
    (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies
    of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed
    us to delay spending for final capping activities;
    (ii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or
    deferred final capping costs; or (iii) completed final
    capping construction that cost less than anticipated.

Interest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure
    liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and
    is recorded as final capping, closure and post-closure expense,
    which is included in “Operating” costs and expenses
    within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The
    amortizable basis of a landfill includes (i) amounts
    previously expended and capitalized; (ii) capitalized
    landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs;
    (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs
    required to develop the landfill site to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity; and (iv) projected asset retirement
    costs related to landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities.

Amortization is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis,
    applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated
    by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a
    landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding
    asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do not own, but
    operate through operating or lease arrangements, the rate per
    ton is calculated based on the lesser of the contractual term of
    the underlying agreement or the life of the landfill.

We apply the following guidelines in determining a
    landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:

•

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently
    unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances.
    First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort,
    we must generally expect the initial expansion permit
    application to be submitted within one year, and the final
    expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we
    must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is
    likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 42 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2008, 19 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Ten of these landfills required
    approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of community or
    political opposition that could impede the expansion process.
    The remaining nine landfills required approval primarily due to
    the permit application processes not meeting the one- or
    five-year requirements, as a result of state-specific permitting
    procedures.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or
    AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the
    measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and then
    adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of settlement
    that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific
    factors including current and projected mix of waste type,
    initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years
    of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access
    to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill
    leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial
    selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level
    review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on
    a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical
    experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at
    a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the
    waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under
    the permit requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement costs related to final capping, and closure and
    post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the
    landfill.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and
    deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the
    corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization
    rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final
    capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure
    activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be
    capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or
    higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the
    opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that
    the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in
    calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be
    required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined
    that the likelihood of receiving the expansion permit has become
    remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort
    are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— We are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that
    existed before we acquired a site. Such liabilities include
    potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations,
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs
    directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such
    as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to
    the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with
    environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review
    and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our
    estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates
    and assumptions.

We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.

There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the
    costs associated with the likely remedy of a site. In these
    cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our
    best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amounts that are the
    low ends of such ranges in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

and its Interpretations. If
    we used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential
    liability would be approximately $135 million higher on a
    discounted basis than the $299 million recorded in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2008.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation of a
    particular site is inherently difficult and determining the
    method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number
    of assumptions be made. Our ultimate responsibility may differ
    materially from current estimates. It is possible that
    technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the
    results of environmental studies, the inability to identify
    other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the
    settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require
    us to record additional liabilities that could be material.
    Additionally, our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities
    could result in revisions that could cause upward or downward
    adjustments to income from operations. These adjustments could
    also be material in any given period.

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular
    environmental remediation liability and the timing of the
    payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in
    current dollars (by 2.5% at both December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007) until the expected time of payment
    and discount the cost to present value using a risk-free
    discount rate, which is based on the rate for United States
    Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted average
    period until settlement of the underlying obligation. We
    determine the risk-free discount rate and the inflation rate on
    an annual basis unless interim changes would significantly
    impact our results of operations. For remedial liabilities that
    have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on
    the effective interest method, in “Operating” costs
    and expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    following table summarizes the impacts of revisions in the
    risk-free discount rate applied to our environmental remediation
    liabilities during the reported periods (in millions) and the
    risk-free discount rate applied as of each reporting date:

In 2008, the net charge to income from operations is reflected

    $6 million reduction in “Minority interest”
    expense. In both 2007 and 2006, the reported amounts were
    included in “Operating” expenses in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

(b)

The impact to earnings in each year also includes the effect of
    discount rate adjustments on our environmental remediation
    recovery assets. In 2006 and 2007, these discount rate
    adjustments were also related to changes in risk-free interest
    rates. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 157, in
    2008, this impact is based on the credit-adjusted, risk-free
    interest rates of third parties.

The portion of our recorded environmental remediation
    liabilities that has never been subject to inflation or
    discounting as the amounts and timing of payments are not
    readily determinable was $47 million at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. Had we not inflated and
    discounted any portion of our environmental remediation
    liability, the amount recorded would have been decreased by
    $6 million at December 31, 2008 and increased by
    $28 million at December 31, 2007.

Property
    and equipment (Exclusive of landfills discussed
    above)

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements are capitalized while major
    maintenance activities are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of these assets using
    the straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for our
    depreciable property and equipment. The estimated useful lives
    for significant property and equipment categories are as follows
    (in years):

Useful Lives

Vehicles — excluding rail haul cars

3 to 10

Vehicles — rail haul cars

10 to 20

Machinery and equipment

Buildings and improvements — excluding waste-to-energy
    facilities

5 to 40

Waste-to-energy facilities and related equipment

up to 50

Furniture, fixtures and office equipment

3 to 10

We include capitalized costs associated with developing or
    obtaining internal-use software within furniture, fixtures and
    office equipment. These costs include external direct costs of
    materials and services used in developing or obtaining the
    software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees
    directly associated with the software development project. As of
    December 31, 2008, capitalized costs for software placed in
    service, net of accumulated depreciation, were $29 million.
    In addition, our furniture, fixtures and office equipment
    includes $90 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    $81 million as of December 31, 2007 for costs incurred
    for software under development. This includes $70 million
    of costs associated with the development of our waste and
    recycling revenue management system. As disclosed in
    Note 10, we have filed a lawsuit against SAP AG and SAP
    America, Inc. related to the implementation of this software. We
    are still examining all of our alternatives associated with the
    development and implementation of a revenue management system,
    some of which may be affected by the ultimate resolution of the
    lawsuit. As we continue to assess the alternatives available to
    us, we may determine that the best course of action will be to
    abandon the SAP revenue management system, which would result in
    an impairment charge of between $45 million and
    $55 million.

When property and equipment are retired, sold or otherwise
    disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
    from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
    results of operations as an offset or increase to operating
    expense for the period.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill, transfer station or
    waste-to-energy facility and equipment such as compactors. Our
    leases have varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase
    options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other
    obligations that we consider in determining minimum lease
    payments. The leases are classified as either operating leases
    or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating leases

— The majority of our leases
    are operating leases. This classification generally can be
    attributed to either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease
    payments as a result of real property lease obligations that
    vary based on the volume of waste we receive or process or
    (ii) minimum lease terms that are much shorter than the
    assets’ economic useful lives. Management expects that in
    the normal course of business our operating leases will be
    renewed, replaced by other leases, or replaced with fixed asset
    expenditures. Our rent expense during each of the last three
    years and our future minimum operating lease payments for each
    of the next five years, for which we are contractually obligated
    as of December 31, 2008, are disclosed in Note 10.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Capital leases

— Assets under capital leases
    are capitalized using interest rates appropriate at the
    inception of each lease and are amortized over either the useful
    life of the asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a
    straight-line basis. The present value of the related lease
    payments is recorded as a debt obligation. Our future minimum
    annual capital lease payments are included in our total future
    debt obligations as disclosed in Note 7.

Acquisitions

We account for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination based on fair value estimates as of the
    date of acquisition. These estimates are revised during the
    allocation period as necessary if, and when, information
    regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and
    quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation
    period generally does not exceed one year. To the extent
    contingencies such as preacquisition environmental matters,
    litigation and related legal fees have been resolved or settled
    during the allocation period, such items have been included in
    the revised allocation of the purchase price. After the
    allocation period, the effect of changes in such contingencies
    has been included in results of operations in the periods in
    which the adjustments are determined.

In certain acquisitions, we agree to pay additional amounts to
    sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses
    of certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue levels,
    targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for
    expanded landfill airspace. Contingent payments, when incurred,
    have been recorded as purchase price adjustments or compensation
    expense, as appropriate, based on the nature of each contingent
    payment. Refer to the

Guarantees

section of Note 10
    for additional information related to these contingent
    obligations.

Discontinued
    operations

We analyze our operations that have been divested or classified
    as held-for-sale in order to determine if they qualify for
    discontinued operations accounting. Only operations that qualify
    as a component of an entity under generally accepted accounting
    principles can be included in discontinued operations. Only
    components of an entity where we do not have significant
    continuing involvement with the divested operations would
    qualify for discontinued operations accounting. For our
    purposes, continuing involvement would include continuing to
    receive waste at our landfill, waste-to-energy facility or
    recycling facility from a divested hauling operation or transfer
    station or continuing to dispose of waste at a divested landfill
    or transfer station. After completing our analysis at
    December 31, 2008, we determined that the operations that
    qualify for discontinued operations accounting are not material
    to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value
    of the net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

, we do not amortize goodwill. As discussed in the

Asset impairments

section below, we assess our goodwill
    for impairment at least annually.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts,
    customer lists, covenants not-to-compete, licenses, permits
    (other than landfill permits, as all landfill related intangible
    assets are combined with landfill tangible assets and amortized
    using our landfill amortization policy), and other contracts.
    Other intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized
    using either a 150% declining balance approach or a
    straight-line basis as we determine appropriate. Customer
    contracts and customer lists are generally amortized over seven
    to ten years. Covenants not-to-compete are amortized over the
    term of the non-compete covenant, which is generally two to five
    years. Licenses, permits and other contracts are amortized over
    the definitive terms of the related agreements. If the
    underlying agreement does not contain definitive terms and the
    useful life is determined to be indefinite, the asset is not
    amortized.

Asset
    impairments

We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If an indication of
    impairment occurs, the asset is reviewed to determine whether
    there has been an impairment. An impairment loss is recorded as
    the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the
    asset. If significant events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may
    not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by
    comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its
    undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be
    separately and independently identified for a single asset, we
    will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group
    of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flow. If
    the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected
    future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the
    fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.
    Fair value is generally determined by considering
    (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow
    analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual
    third-party valuations;

and/or

(iii) information available regarding the current market
    environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or
    asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of
    the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the
    difference is recorded in the period that the impairment
    indicator occurs and is included in the “(Income) expense
    from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and
    projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There
    are other considerations for impairments of landfills and
    goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the fair value of each Group to its carrying value,
    including goodwill. We rely on discounted cash flow analysis,
    which requires significant judgments and estimates about the
    future operations of each Group, to develop our estimates of
    fair value. Additional impairment assessments may be performed
    on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in
    circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not,
    the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired.

Restricted
    trust and escrow accounts

As of December 31, 2008, our restricted trust and escrow
    accounts consist principally of (i) funds deposited for
    purposes of settling landfill closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation obligations; (ii) funds held in
    trust for the construction of various facilities; and
    (iii) funds held in trust for the repayment of our debt
    obligations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had
    $381 million and $418 million, respectively, of
    restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are primarily
    included in long-term “Other assets” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Closure, post-closure and environmental remediation
    funds

— At several of our landfills, we provide
    financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust
    funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling closure,
    post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. Balances
    maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will
    fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements;
    (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual
    arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of funds for qualifying
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities;
    (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills; and
    (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments
    held in the trust fund or escrow accounts.

    activities. Accordingly, these borrowings are excluded from
    financing activities in our Statement of Cash Flows. At the time
    our construction and equipment expenditures have been documented
    and approved by the applicable bond trustee, the funds are
    released and we receive cash. These amounts are reported in the
    Statement of Cash Flows as an investing activity when the cash
    is released from the trust funds. Generally, the funds are fully
    expended within a few years of the debt issuance. When the debt
    matures, we repay our obligation with cash on hand and the debt
    repayments are included as a financing activity in the Statement
    of Cash Flows.

Debt service funds

— Funds are held in trust to
    meet future principal and interest payments required under
    certain of our tax-exempt project bonds.

Derivative
    financial instruments

We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage our
    risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use interest rate swaps to maintain
    a strategic portion of our debt obligations at variable,
    market-driven interest rates. In prior periods, we have also
    entered into interest rate derivatives in anticipation of our
    senior note issuances to effectively lock in a fixed interest
    rate. Foreign currency exchange rate derivatives are used to
    hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates for anticipated
    cash transactions between WM Holdings and its Canadian
    subsidiaries.

We obtain current valuations of our interest rate and foreign
    currency hedging instruments from third-party pricing models.
    The estimated fair values of derivatives used to hedge risks
    fluctuate over time and should be viewed in relation to the
    underlying hedged transaction and the overall management of our
    exposure to fluctuations in the underlying risks. The fair value
    of derivatives is included in other current assets, other
    long-term assets, accrued liabilities or other long-term
    liabilities, as appropriate. Any ineffectiveness present in
    either fair value or cash flow hedges is recognized immediately
    in earnings without offset. There was no significant
    ineffectiveness in 2008, 2007 or 2006.

•

Interest rate derivatives

— Our interest rate
    swaps have been designated as fair value hedges for accounting
    purposes, which results in derivative assets being accounted for
    as corresponding increases in the carrying value of our
    underlying debt obligations and derivative liabilities being
    accounted for as corresponding decreases in the carrying value
    of our underlying debt instruments. These fair value adjustments
    are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
    over the remaining term of the hedged instruments. The impacts
    of our use of interest rate derivatives on the carrying value of
    our debt and interest expense are discussed in Note 7.

•

Foreign currency derivatives

— Our foreign
    currency derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges
    for accounting purposes, which results in the unrealized changes
    in the fair value of the derivative instruments being recorded
    in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” within the
    equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    associated balance in other comprehensive income is reclassified
    to earnings as the hedged cash flows occur. In each of the
    periods presented, these derivatives have effectively mitigated
    the impacts of the hedged transactions, resulting in immaterial
    impacts to our results of operations for the periods presented.

Self-insurance
    reserves and recoveries

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. The exposure for
    unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but
    not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance
    of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and
    historical trends and data. The gross estimated liability
    associated with settling



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

unpaid claims is included in “Accrued liabilities” in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets if expected to be settled within
    one year, or otherwise is included in long-term “Other
    liabilities.” Estimated insurance recoveries related to
    recorded liabilities are reflected as current “Other
    receivables” or long-term “Other assets” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets when we believe that the receipt of
    such amounts is probable.

Foreign
    currency

We have operations in Canada. The functional currency of our
    Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars. The assets and
    liabilities of our foreign operations are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance sheet
    date. Revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars
    using the average exchange rate during the period. The resulting
    translation difference is reflected as a component of
    comprehensive income.

Revenue
    recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste
    collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services and the
    sale of recycled commodities, electricity and steam. The fees
    charged for our services are generally defined in our service
    agreements and vary based on contract specific terms such as
    frequency of service, weight, volume and the general market
    factors influencing a region’s rates. The fees we charge
    for our services generally include fuel surcharges, which are
    intended to pass through increased direct and indirect costs
    incurred because of changes in market prices for fuel. We
    generally recognize revenue as services are performed or
    products are delivered. For example, revenue typically is
    recognized as waste is collected, tons are received at our
    landfills or transfer stations, recycling commodities are
    delivered or as kilowatts are delivered to a customer by a
    waste-to-energy facility or independent power production plant.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services
    include, among others, certain residential contracts that are
    billed on a quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance
    billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as
    revenue in the period service is provided.

Capitalized
    interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development,
    including internal-use software and landfill expansion projects,
    and on certain assets under construction, including operating
    landfills and waste-to-energy facilities. During 2008, 2007 and
    2006, total interest costs were $472 million,
    $543 million and $563 million, respectively, of which
    $17 million for 2008, $22 million for 2007 and
    $18 million for 2006, were capitalized, primarily for
    landfill construction costs. The capitalization of interest for
    operating landfills is based on the costs incurred in the
    pursuit of probable landfill expansions and on discrete landfill
    cell construction projects that are expected to exceed $500,000
    and require over 60 days to construct. In addition to the
    direct cost of the cell construction project, the calculation of
    capitalized interest includes an allocated portion of the common
    landfill site costs. The common landfill site costs include the
    development costs of a landfill project or the purchase price of
    an operating landfill, and the ongoing infrastructure costs
    benefiting the landfill over its useful life. These costs are
    amortized to expense in a manner consistent with other landfill
    site costs.

Income
    taxes

The Company is subject to income tax in the United States,
    Canada and Puerto Rico. Current tax obligations associated with
    our provision for income taxes are reflected in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of “Accrued
    liabilities,” and the deferred tax obligations are
    reflected in “Deferred income taxes.”

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the
    financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The
    deferred income tax provision represents the change during the
    reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
    Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards
    and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available
    evidence, it is more



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in
    assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable
    items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our
    tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that
    certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed.
    When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves
    through our provision for income taxes.

To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing
    authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have
    been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax
    expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elected
    this accounting policy, which is a continuation of our
    historical policy, in connection with our adoption of
    FIN 48.

Contingent
    liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with
    respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. We are party to pending or threatened
    legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters in various
    jurisdictions. It is not always possible to predict the outcome
    of litigation, as it is subject to many uncertainties.
    Additionally, it is not always possible for management to make a
    meaningful estimate of the potential loss or range of loss
    associated with such litigation.

Our recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2008 include

At several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by
    depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts
    for purposes of settling closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation obligations. The fair value of these escrow accounts

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual,
    fourth quarter goodwill impairment tests in 2008, 2007 or 2006.
    Additionally, we did not encounter any events or changes in
    circumstances that indicated that an impairment was more likely
    than not during interim periods in 2008, 2007 or 2006. However,
    there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at
    any time in the future.

In late 2008, our WMRA segment experienced a rapid decline in
    commodity prices due to a significant decrease in demand for
    recyclable commodities both domestically and internationally.
    This decline was considered in our annual impairment test for
    2008. Although we currently believe that these market conditions
    are temporary in nature, a sustained period of depressed
    commodity prices

and/or

demand for recyclables could result in a significant decline in
    the estimated fair value of WMRA. Such a decline could require
    us to record a non-cash impairment charge to WMRA’s
    goodwill balance, which was $143 million at
    December 31, 2008. The estimated fair value of WMRA is
    based upon discounted cash flow analysis, and is directly
    impacted by our expectations for the recovery of commodity
    prices and the demand for recyclables, our cost of goods sold
    and interest rates used for discounting.

Refer to Note 20 for a summary of changes in our goodwill
    during 2008 and 2007 by reportable segment.

Revolving credit facility

— On August 17,
    2006, WMI entered into a five-year, $2.4 billion revolving
    credit facility. This facility provides us with credit capacity
    to be used for either cash borrowings or to support letters of
    credit. At December 31, 2008, we had $300 million of
    outstanding borrowings and $1,803 million of letters of
    credit issued and supported by the facility. The unused and
    available credit capacity of the facility was $297 million
    as of December 31, 2008.

The $300 million of outstanding borrowings at
    December 31, 2007 was repaid in the first quarter of 2008
    with $50 million of available cash and $250 million of
    proceeds from the March 2008 issuance of senior notes discussed
    below. The current borrowing was made in November 2008 to repay
    a portion of the $386 million of 6.5% senior notes
    that matured on November 15, 2008.

The borrowing outstanding at December 31, 2008 matures in
    the first quarter of 2009, although we currently intend to
    refinance this borrowing on a long-term basis. Accordingly, this
    debt obligation has been reflected as long-term in our
    December 31, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of
    December 31, 2007, $250 million of our outstanding
    debt obligation under the facility was reflected as long-term in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Letter of credit facilities

— As of
    December 31, 2008, we have a $175 million letter of
    credit and term loan agreement that expires in June 2010 and a
    $105 million letter of credit and term loan agreement that
    expires in June 2013. These facilities are currently being used
    to back letters of credit issued to support our bonding and
    financial assurance needs. Our letters of credit generally have
    terms providing for automatic renewal after one year. In the
    event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit, the amount
    of the draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally
    converts into a term loan for the remaining term of the
    respective agreement or facility. Through December 31,
    2008, we had not experienced any unreimbursed draws on letters
    of credit under these facilities.



WASTE

NOTES TO

    (Continued)

As of December 31, 2008, no borrowings were outstanding
    under these letter of credit facilities, and we had unused and
    available credit capacity of $8 million.

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
    Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility
    agreement with an initial credit capacity of up to Canadian
    $410 million. The agreement was entered into to facilitate
    WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from
    its Canadian subsidiaries. In December 2007, we amended the
    agreement, increasing the available capacity, which had been
    reduced to Canadian $305 million due to debt repayments, to
    Canadian $340 million, extending the maturity date to
    November 2012 and adding an uncommitted option to increase the
    capacity by an additional Canadian $25 million.

As of December 31, 2008, we had US$247 million of
    principal (US$242 million net of discount) outstanding
    under this credit facility. Advances under the facility do not
    accrue interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we
    initially received were for the principal amount of the advances
    net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the
    advance, and the debt was initially recorded based on the net
    proceeds received. The advances have a weighted average
    effective interest rate of 3.3% at December 31, 2008, which
    is being amortized to interest expense with a corresponding
    increase in our recorded debt obligation using the effective
    interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2008,
    we increased the carrying value of the debt for the recognition
    of US$13 million of interest expense. A total of
    US$53 million of advances under the facility matured during
    2008 and were repaid with available cash. Accounting for changes
    in the Canadian currency translation rate decreased the carrying
    value of these borrowings by US$54 million during 2008.

Our outstanding advances mature less than one year from the date
    of issuance, but may be renewed under the terms of the facility,
    which matures in November 2012. We currently expect to repay
    US$33 million of our borrowings under the facility with
    available cash and refinance the remaining borrowings.
    Accordingly, US$209 million of these borrowings are
    classified as long-term in our December 31, 2008
    Consolidated Balance Sheet based on our intent and ability to
    refinance the obligations under the terms of the facility. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had expected to repay a portion of
    our borrowings under the facility with available cash and
    refinance the remaining borrowings under the terms of the
    facility. Based on our expectations at that time, we classified
    US$55 million as current and US$281 million as
    long-term in our December 31, 2007 Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

Senior notes

— In March 2008, we issued
    $600 million of 6.1% senior notes due March 15,
    2018. The net proceeds from the debt issuance were
    $594 million. A portion of the proceeds from this offering
    was used to repay $250 million of outstanding borrowings
    under our revolving credit facility. The remaining proceeds from
    the offering were used for the early redemption of
    $244 million of 8.75% senior notes that matured in May
    2018, but became callable by us beginning in May 2008. We
    elected to call the notes in May 2008 due to their relatively
    high interest rate. As a result of the early retirement of these
    senior notes, we recognized a net reduction in interest expense
    of approximately $10 million for the immediate recognition
    of fair value adjustments associated with terminated interest
    rate swaps that had been deferred and were being amortized over
    the life of the debt.

In connection with our March 2008 issuance of the senior notes,
    we executed interest rate swap contracts with a total notional
    value of $200 million. We designated these
    fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value
    hedges, resulting in all fair value adjustments being reflected
    as a component of the carrying value of the underlying debt.

On November 15, 2008, $386 million of 6.5% senior
    notes matured and were repaid with $300 million of
    borrowings under the revolving credit facility and available
    cash. We have $500 million of 6.875% senior notes that
    mature in May 2009 that we currently expect to refinance on a
    long-term basis by issuing new senior notes. If the credit
    markets are not available to us, or are not available on terms
    we deem acceptable, we expect to rely on our available cash and
    the cash we generate from our operations to repay this debt.
    While we intend to refinance this debt on a long-term basis, it
    has been classified as current in the December 31, 2008
    Consolidated Balance Sheet

because we do not have sufficient available and forecasted
    capacity under our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility
    to demonstrate our ability to do so at the balance sheet date.

Tax-exempt bonds

— We actively issue tax-exempt
    bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital
    expenditures. We issued $171 million of tax-exempt bonds
    during 2008. The proceeds from these debt issuances may only be
    used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised,
    which is generally to finance expenditures for landfill
    construction and development, equipment, vehicles and facilities
    in support of our operations. Proceeds from bond issues are held
    in trust until such time as we incur qualified expenditures, at
    which time we are reimbursed from the trust funds. During the
    year ended December 31, 2008, $20 million of our
    tax-exempt bonds were repaid with either available cash or debt
    service funds.

We issue both fixed- and variable-rate tax-exempt obligations.
    Interest rates on variable-rate tax-exempt bonds are reset on
    either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. If
    the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the
    remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds are
    supported by letters of credit guaranteeing repayment of the
    bonds in this event. As of December 31, 2008, we have
    $771 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds. We
    classified these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 because the borrowings
    are supported by letters of credit issued under our five-year
    revolving credit facility, which is long-term.

As of December 31, 2008, $347 million of fixed-rate
    tax-exempt bonds are subject to repricing within the next twelve
    months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the
    re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can
    be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not
    backed by letters of credit that would serve to guarantee
    repayment in the event of a failed re-offering and are,
    therefore, considered a current obligation for financial
    reporting purposes. However, $233 million of these bonds
    have been classified as long-term in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as of December 31, 2008. The classification of these
    obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to refinance
    the borrowings with other long-term financings in the event of a
    failed re-offering and our ability, in the event other sources
    of long-term financing are not available, to use our five-year
    revolving credit facility. The classification of these
    obligations as long-term was limited to $233 million by the
    available and forecasted capacity of our $2.4 billion
    revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2008.

Tax-exempt project bonds

— Tax-exempt project
    bonds have been used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the
    development of waste-to-energy facilities. These facilities are
    integral to the local communities they serve, and, as such, are
    supported by long-term contracts with multiple municipalities.
    The bonds generally have periodic amortizations that are
    supported by the cash flow of each specific facility being
    financed. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
    repaid $68 million of our tax-exempt project bonds with
    either available cash or debt service funds.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $46 million of
    tax-exempt project bonds that are remarketed either daily or
    weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable
    yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds,
    then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds
    are supported by letters of credit guaranteeing repayment of the
    bonds in this event. We classified these borrowings as long-term
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008
    because the borrowings are supported by letters of credit issued
    under our five-year revolving credit facility, which is
    long-term.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, we had
    $40 million of fixed rate tax-exempt project bonds subject
    to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to
    their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are
    unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring
    immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of
    credit that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a
    failed re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current
    obligation for financial reporting purposes.

Capital leases and other

— The decrease in our
    capital leases and other debt obligations in 2008 is primarily
    related to the repayment of various borrowings upon their
    scheduled maturities.

Scheduled debt and capital lease payments

—
    Scheduled debt and capital lease payments for the next five
    years are as follows: $1,184 million in 2009;
    $719 million in 2010; $255 million in 2011;
    $583 million in 2012; and $170 million in 2013. Our
    recorded debt and capital lease obligations include non-cash
    adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value
    adjustments for interest rate hedging activities, which have
    been excluded from these amounts because they will not result in
    cash payments.

Scheduled debt maturities for 2009 include (i) the
    $300 million borrowing outstanding under the revolving
    credit facility; (ii) US$247 million of advances
    outstanding under the Canadian credit facility;
    (iii) $500 million of 6.875% senior notes that
    mature in May 2009; (iv) $41 million of tax-exempt
    bonds; (v) $63 million of tax-exempt project bonds;
    and (vi) $33 million of capital leases and other debt
    obligations. As discussed above, $509 million of these
    borrowings have been classified as long-term based on our intent
    and ability to refinance the obligations on a long-term basis.

Secured debt

— Our debt balances are generally
    unsecured, except for $133 million of the tax-exempt
    project bonds outstanding at December 31, 2008 that were
    issued by certain subsidiaries within our Wheelabrator Group.
    These bonds are secured by the related subsidiaries’ assets
    that have a carrying value of $439 million and the related
    subsidiaries’ future revenue.

Debt
    Covenants

Our revolving credit facility and certain other financing
    agreements contain financial covenants. The most restrictive of
    these financial covenants are contained in our revolving credit
    facility. The following table summarizes the requirements of
    these financial covenants and the results of the calculation, as
    defined by the revolving credit facility:

Our revolving credit facility and senior notes also contain
    certain restrictions intended to monitor our level of
    indebtedness, types of investments and net worth. We monitor our
    compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they
    significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or
    financing arrangements typical for our business. As of
    December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the covenants
    and restrictions under all of our debt agreements.

Interest
    rate swaps

We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio largely
    by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position
    of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2008,
    the interest payments on $2.0 billion of our fixed-rate
    debt have been swapped to variable rates, allowing us to
    maintain approximately 67% of our debt at fixed interest rates
    and approximately 33% of our debt at variable interest rates. We
    do not use interest rate derivatives for trading or speculative
    purposes. Our significant interest rate swap agreements that
    were outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are set
    forth in the table below (dollars in millions):

    $150 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    $72 million as of December 31, 2007. The following

At December 31, 2008, $18 million (on a pre-tax basis)
    of the carrying value of debt associated with terminated swap
    agreements is scheduled to be reclassified as a reduction in
    interest expense over the next twelve months.

Interest rate swap agreements decreased net interest expense by
    $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and
    increased net interest expense by $11 million and
    $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The significant increase in the benefit
    recognized as a result of our interest rate swap agreements is
    largely attributable to the decrease in short-term market
    interest rates, which drive our periodic interest obligations
    under these agreements. The benefit from our interest rate swap
    agreements in 2008 is also related to the $10 million net
    reduction in interest expense from terminated interest rate
    swaps associated with the early retirement of $244 million
    of $8.75% senior notes discussed above.

The significant terms of the interest rate contracts and the
    underlying debt instruments are identical and therefore no
    ineffectiveness has been realized.

Interest
    rate locks

In the past, we have entered into cash flow hedges to secure
    underlying interest rates in anticipation of senior note
    issuances. These hedging agreements resulted in a deferred loss,
    net of taxes, of $20 million at December 31, 2008 and
    $24 million at December 31, 2007, which is included in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” As of
    December 31, 2008, $7 million (on a pre-tax basis) is
    scheduled to be reclassified into interest expense over the next
    twelve months.

Tax audit settlements

— The Company and its
    subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States and
    Puerto Rico, as well as various state and local jurisdictions
    and Canada. We are currently under audit by the IRS and from
    time to time we are audited by other taxing authorities. Our
    audits are in various stages of completion.

During 2008, we settled IRS audits for the 2006 and 2007 tax
    years as well as various state tax audits. In addition, we
    settled Canadian audits for the tax years 2002 through 2005. The
    settlement of these tax audits resulted in a reduction to our
    provision for income taxes of $26 million, or $0.05 per
    diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008.

During 2007, we settled an IRS audit for the tax years 2004 and
    2005 and various state tax audits, resulting in a reduction in
    income tax expense of $40 million, or $0.08 per diluted
    share. Our 2007 net income was also increased by
    $1 million due to interest income recognized from audit
    settlements. During 2006, we completed the IRS audit for the
    years 2002 and 2003. The settlement of the IRS audit, as well as
    other state and foreign tax audit matters, resulted in a
    reduction in our 2006 provision for income taxes (excluding the
    effects of related interest income) of $149 million, or
    $0.27 per diluted share. Our 2006 net income also increased
    by $14 million, or $9 million net of tax, principally
    due to interest income from audit settlements. The reduction in
    income taxes recognized as a result of these settlements is
    primarily due to the associated reduction in our long-term
    accrued tax liabilities. Our recorded liabilities associated
    with uncertain tax positions are discussed below.

We are currently in the examination phase of an IRS audit for
    the 2008 tax year, and expect this audit to be completed within
    the next 12 months. Audits associated with state and local
    jurisdictions date back to 1999 and Canadian examinations date
    back to 1998.

Non-conventional fuel tax credits

— The
    favorable impact of non-conventional fuel tax credits on our
    2007 and 2006 effective tax rates was derived from our
    investments in two coal-based, synthetic fuel production
    facilities and our landfill gas-to-energy projects. The fuel
    generated from the facilities and our landfill gas-to-energy
    projects qualified for tax credits through 2007 under
    Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code.

The tax credits were subject to a phase-out if the price of
    crude oil exceeded an annual average price threshold determined
    by the Internal Revenue Service. As of December 31, 2007,
    our estimate of the 2007 phase-out rate was 69%. In April 2008,
    the IRS published the phase-out percentage that must be applied
    to Section 45K tax credits generated in 2007, which was
    approximately 67%. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    estimated that 36% of Section 45K tax credits generated
    during 2006 would be phased out. In April 2007, the IRS
    established the final phase-out of Section 45K credits
    generated during 2006 at approximately 33%.

Our minority ownership interests in the facilities resulted in
    the recognition of our pro-rata share of the facilities’
    losses, the amortization of our investments, and additional
    expense associated with other estimated obligations all being
    recorded as “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated
    entities” within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table summarizes the impact of our investments in
    the facilities on our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in

(a)

As discussed above, the comparison of the impacts of our
    investments in the facilities during the periods presented have
    been significantly affected by (i) the phase-out of 69% of
    Section 45K tax credits in 2007 and 36% in 2006; and
    (ii) the expiration of our investments and the
    Section 45K tax credits at the end of 2007. In addition,
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, our “Equity in
    net losses of unconsolidated entities” was reduced by a
    cumulative adjustment recorded during the second quarter of
    2006, which was necessary to appropriately reflect our
    life-to-date obligations to fund the costs of operating the
    facilities and the value of our investment. We determined that
    the recognition of the cumulative adjustment was not material to
    our financial statements presented herein. Equity losses for our
    estimate of contractual obligations associated with the
    facilities’ operations and associated tax benefits were
    also relatively lower in 2006 due to the suspension of
    operations of the facilities from May 2006 to late September
    2006.

(b)

The benefit from income taxes attributable to the facilities
    includes tax credits of $3 million, $37 million and
    $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

In 2006 and 2007, we also generated Section 45K tax credits
    through our Renewable Energy Program, under which we develop,
    operate and promote the beneficial use of landfill gas. Our
    recorded taxes include benefits of $13 million and
    $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, from tax credits generated by our landfill
    gas-to-energy projects.

Effective state tax rate change

— During 2008,
    our current state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 6.0% primarily
    due to changes in state law. The increase in our effective tax
    rate attributable to state income taxes when comparing 2008 with
    2007 and 2006 was primarily a result of this rate increase. The
    comparison of our effective state tax rate during the reported
    periods has also been affected by return-to-accrual adjustments,
    which reduced our “Provision for income taxes” in both
    2007 and 2006. Our estimated effective state tax rate declined
    during 2006, resulting in a net benefit of $9 million
    related to the revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax
    liabilities. Our state estimated effective tax rate did not
    change in 2007; therefore no revaluation of net accumulated
    deferred tax liabilities was necessary.

Canada statutory tax rate change

— During 2007,
    the Canadian federal government enacted tax rate reductions,
    which resulted in a $30 million tax benefit for the
    revaluation of our deferred tax balances. During 2006, both the
    Canadian federal government and several provinces enacted tax
    rate reductions. The revaluation of our deferred tax balances
    for these rate changes resulted in a $20 million tax
    benefit for the year ended December 31, 2006. We did not
    have any comparable adjustments during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Repatriation of earnings in foreign
    subsidiaries

— During 2006, we repatriated
    $12 million of our accumulated foreign earnings, resulting
    in an increase in tax expense of $3 million. No foreign
    earnings were repatriated during 2007 or 2008.

At December 31, 2008, remaining unremitted earnings in
    foreign operations were approximately $500 million, which
    are considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision
    for U.S. income taxes has been accrued for these unremitted
    earnings.

At December 31, 2008, we had $29 million of federal
    net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, $1.1 billion of
    state NOL carryforwards, and $15 million of Canadian NOL
    carryforwards. The federal and state NOL carryforwards have
    expiration dates through the year 2028. The Canadian NOL
    carryforwards have the following expiry: $13 million in
    2009 and $2 million in 2016. In addition, we have
    $40 million of state tax credit carryforwards at
    December 31, 2008.

We have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in
    realizing the benefit of tax loss and credit carryforwards and
    other deferred tax assets. While we expect to realize the
    deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances, changes in
    estimates of future taxable income or in tax laws may alter this
    expectation. The valuation allowance decreased $33 million
    in 2008. We realized a $3 million state tax benefit due to
    a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the expected
    utilization of state NOL and credit carryforwards. The remaining
    reduction in our valuation allowance was offset by changes in
    our gross deferred tax assets due to changes in state NOL and
    credit carryforwards.

Liabilities
    for uncertain tax positions

As discussed in Note 2, we adopted FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1

effective January 1, 2007. As a result of both of these
    adoptions, we recognized, as a cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle, a $28 million increase in our
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, a $32 million
    increase in our non-current deferred tax assets and a
    $4 million increase in our beginning retained earnings.

Upon adoption of FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1,

our income tax liabilities as of January 1, 2007 included a

    $16 million of related accrued interest. A reconciliation

These liabilities are primarily included as a component of
    long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate
    that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash
    within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2008,
    $58 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized in
    future periods, would impact our effective tax rate.

We recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in tax expense. During the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recognized
    approximately $4 million, $7 million and
    $7 million, respectively, of such interest expense as a
    component of our “Provision for income taxes.” We had
    approximately $9 million and $13 million of accrued
    interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We do not have
    any accrued liabilities or expense for penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006.

We anticipate that approximately $20 million of liabilities
    for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and
    $4 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed
    within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals are
    related to various federal and state tax items, none of which
    are material, and are expected to result from audit settlements
    or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
    period.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Defined contribution plans —

Our Waste
    Management Retirement Savings Plan covers employees (except
    those working subject to collective bargaining agreements, which
    do not provide for coverage under such plans) following a

90-day

waiting period after hire. Eligible employees may contribute as
    much as 25% of their annual compensation under the Savings Plan,
    subject to annual contribution limitations established by the
    IRS. Under the Savings Plan, we match, in cash, 100% of employee
    contributions on the first 3% of their eligible compensation and
    match 50% of employee contributions on the next 3% of their
    eligible compensation, resulting in a maximum match of 4.5%.
    Both employee and Company contributions vest immediately.
    Charges to “Operating” and “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses for our defined contribution plans
    were $59 million in 2008, $54 million in 2007 and
    $51 million in 2006.

Defined benefit plans —

Certain of the
    Company’s subsidiaries sponsor pension plans that cover
    employees not covered by the Savings Plan. These employees are
    members of collective bargaining units. In addition,
    Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary,
    sponsors a pension plan for its former executives and former
    Board members. As of December 31, 2008, the combined
    benefit obligation of these pension plans was $66 million,
    and the plans had $41 million of plan assets, resulting in
    an unfunded benefit obligation for these plans of

In addition, Waste Management Holdings, Inc. and certain of its
    subsidiaries provided post-retirement health care and other
    benefits to eligible employees. In conjunction with our
    acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998, we limited
    participation in these plans to participating retired employees
    as of December 31, 1998. The unfunded benefit obligation
    for these plans was $52 million at December 31, 2008.

Our accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension
    and other post-retirement plans are $77 million as of
    December 31, 2008 and are included as a component of
    “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed
    multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans for employees who
    participate in collective bargaining agreements. Contributions
    of $35 million in 2008, $33 million in 2007 and
    $37 million in 2006 were charged to operations for our
    subsidiaries’ ongoing participation in these defined
    benefit plans. Our portion of the projected benefit obligation,
    plan assets and unfunded liability of the multi-employer pension
    plans are not material to our financial position. Specific
    benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not
    negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.

Based on our negotiations with collective bargaining units and
    our review of the plans in which they participate, we may
    negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or
    more of these pension plans. If we elect to withdraw from these
    plans, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for
    unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. As
    discussed in Note 10, in 2008, we recognized an aggregate
    charge of $39 million to “Operating” expenses for
    the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multi-employer
    pension plans.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Financial instruments

— We have obtained
    letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies and
    have established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to
    support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure requirements, environmental
    remediation, and other obligations.

Historically, our revolving credit facilities have been used to
    obtain letters of credit to support our bonding and financial
    assurance needs. We also have two letter of credit and term loan
    agreements that were established to provide us with additional
    sources of capacity from which we may obtain letters of credit.
    These facilities are discussed further in Note 7. We obtain
    surety bonds and insurance policies from an entity in which we
    have a non-controlling financial interest. We also obtain
    insurance from a wholly-owned insurance company, the sole
    business of which is to issue policies for the parent holding
    company and its other subsidiaries, to secure such performance
    obligations. In those instances where our use of captive
    insurance is not allowed, we generally have available
    alternative bonding mechanisms.

Because virtually no claims have been made against the financial
    instruments we use to support our obligations, and considering
    our current financial position, management does not expect that
    any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty
    in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for
    our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks
    of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity,
    we continue to evaluate various options to access cost-effective
    sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance coverage for
    protection of our assets and operations from certain risks
    including automobile liability, general liability, real and
    personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’
    and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and
    other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our
    exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to
    the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy.
    Our exposure, however, could increase if our insurers were
    unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation
    insurance programs. For our self-insured retentions, the
    exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including
    incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial
    valuation and internal estimates. The



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if
    future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from
    the assumptions used. As of December 31, 2008, our general
    liability insurance program carried self-insurance exposures of
    up to $2.5 million per incident and our workers’
    compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures
    of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31,
    2008, our auto liability insurance program included a
    per-incident base deductible of $1 million, subject to
    additional aggregate deductibles in the $1 million to
    $5 million layer and the $5 million to
    $10 million layer of $2.4 million and
    $2.5 million, respectively. Self-insurance claims reserves
    acquired as part of our acquisition of WM Holdings in July
    1998 were discounted at 2.25% at December 31, 2008 and 4.0%
    at December 31, 2007. The changes to our net insurance
    liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008
    are summarized below (in millions):

(a)

Amounts reported as estimated insurance recoveries are related
    to both paid and unpaid claims liabilities.

For the 14 months ended January 1, 2000, we insured
    certain risks, including auto, general liability and
    workers’ compensation, with Reliance National Insurance
    Company, whose parent filed for bankruptcy in June 2001. In
    October 2001, the parent and certain of its subsidiaries,
    including Reliance National Insurance Company, were placed in
    liquidation. We believe that because of probable recoveries from
    the liquidation, currently estimated to be $15 million, it
    is unlikely that events relating to Reliance will have a
    material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property,
    environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating leases

— Rental expense for leased
    properties was $114 million, $135 million and
    $122 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    These amounts primarily include rents under operating leases.
    Minimum contractual payments due for our operating lease
    obligations are $81 million in 2009, $71 million in
    2010, $58 million in 2011, $57 million in 2012 and
    $46 million in 2013.

Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during
    future periods is significantly less than current year rent
    expense because our significant lease agreements at landfills
    have variable terms based either on a percentage of revenue or a
    rate per ton of waste received.

Other commitments

— We have the following
    unconditional obligations:

•

Fuel Supply

— We have purchase agreements
    expiring at various dates through 2011 that require us to
    purchase minimum amounts of wood waste, anthracite coal waste
    (culm) and conventional fuels at our independent power
    production plants. These fuel supplies are used to produce steam
    that is sold to industrial



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

and commercial users and electricity that is sold to electric
    utilities, which is generally subject to the terms and
    conditions of long-term contracts. Our purchase agreements have
    been established based on the plants’ anticipated fuel
    supply needs to meet the demands of our customers under these
    long-term electricity sale contracts. Under our fuel supply
    take-or-pay contracts, we are generally obligated to pay for a
    minimum amount of waste or conventional fuel at a stated rate
    even if such quantities are not required in our operations.

•

Disposal

— We have several agreements expiring
    at various dates through 2024 that require us to dispose of a
    minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under
    these put-or-pay agreements, we are required to pay for the
    agreed upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of
    tons placed at the facilities.

•

Waste Paper

— We are party to a waste paper
    purchase agreement that requires us to purchase a minimum number
    of tons of waste paper. The cost per ton we pay is based on
    market prices plus the cost of delivery to our customers. We
    currently expect to fulfill our purchase obligations by 2012.

•

Royalties

— At some of our landfills, we are
    required to make minimum royalty payments to the prior land
    owners, lessors or host communities where the landfills are
    located. Our obligations expire at various dates through 2023.
    Although we have an obligation to make minimum payments, actual
    payments are based on per ton rates for waste received at the
    landfill and are significantly higher.

•

Property

— From time to time, we make
    commitments to purchase assets that we expect to use in our
    operations. We are currently party to an agreement to purchase a
    corporate aircraft to replace an existing aircraft, the lease
    for which is expiring in early 2011. The agreement requires that
    we make installment payments between now and delivery, expected
    in 2010, based on the total purchase price for the aircraft.

Our unconditional obligations are established in the ordinary
    course of our business and are structured in a manner that
    provides us with access to important resources at competitive,
    market-driven rates. Our actual future obligations under these
    outstanding agreements are generally quantity driven, and, as a
    result, our associated financial obligations are not fixed as of
    December 31, 2008. We currently expect the products and
    services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the
    needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect
    these established arrangements to materially impact our future
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following
    guarantee agreements associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2008, WM Holdings has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior
    indebtedness, which matures through 2032. WMI has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of the senior indebtedness of
    WM Holdings, which matures through 2026. Performance under
    these guarantee agreements would be required if either party
    defaulted on their respective obligations. No additional
    liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees because the
    underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. See Note 22 for further information.

•

WMI and WM Holdings have guaranteed the tax-exempt bonds
    and other debt obligations of their subsidiaries. If a
    subsidiary fails to meet its obligations associated with its
    debt agreements as they come due, WMI or WM Holdings will
    be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 for information
    related to the balances and maturities of our tax-exempt bonds.

•

We have guaranteed certain financial obligations of
    unconsolidated entities. The related obligations, which mature
    through 2020, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of December 31, 2008, our maximum future
    payments associated with these guarantees are approximately
    $10 million. We do not believe that it is likely that we
    will be required to perform under these guarantees.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

•

WM Holdings has guaranteed all reimbursement obligations of
    WMI under its $280 million letter of credit and term loan
    agreements. Under those facilities, WMI must reimburse the
    entities funding the facilities for any draw on a letter of
    credit supported by the facilities. As of December 31,
    2008, we had $272 million in outstanding letters of credit
    under these facilities.

•

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market or
    contractually determined value of certain homeowners’
    properties that are adjacent to certain of our landfills. These
    guarantee agreements extend over the life of the respective
    landfill. Under these agreements, we would be responsible for
    the difference, if any, between the sale value and the
    guaranteed market or contractually determined value of the
    homeowners’ properties. Generally, it is not possible to
    determine the contingent obligation associated with these
    guarantees, but we do not believe that these contingent
    obligations will have a material effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

We have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested
    assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of
    our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items
    that are currently recorded as obligations, we do not believe
    that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations
    associated with these indemnities. Additionally, under certain
    of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional
    consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial
    targets are achieved post-closing. The costs associated with any
    additional consideration requirements have been accounted for as
    incurred.

•

WMI and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial
    and general operating obligations of certain of their
    subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual
    obligations as they come due, the guarantor has an unconditional
    obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has
    been recorded for service, financial or general operating
    guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are
    properly accounted for as costs of operations as services are
    provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No
    additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees
    because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly
    accounted for as operating or capital leases, as appropriate.

We currently do not believe it is reasonably likely that we
    would be called upon to perform under these guarantees and do
    not believe that any of the obligations would have a material
    effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Environmental matters

— Our business is
    intrinsically connected with the protection of the environment.
    As such, a significant portion of our operating costs and
    capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of
    environmental protection. Such costs may increase in the future
    as a result of legislation or regulation. However, we generally
    do not believe that increases in environmental regulation
    negatively affect our business, because such regulations
    increase the demand for our services, and we have the resources
    and experience to manage environmental risk.

As of December 31, 2008, we had been notified that we are a
    PRP in connection with 74 locations listed on the EPA’s
    National Priorities List, or NPL. Of the 74 sites at which
    claims have been made against us, 16 are sites we own. Each of
    the NPL sites we own was initially developed by others as
    landfill disposal facilities. At each of these facilities, we
    are working in conjunction with the government to characterize
    or remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed
    with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing
    the costs of remediation or are pursuing resolution of an
    allocation formula. We generally expect to receive any amounts
    due from these parties at or near the time that we make the
    remedial expenditures. The other 58 NPL sites, which we do not
    own, are at various procedural stages under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
    as amended, known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of these proceedings involve allegations that
    certain of our subsidiaries (or their predecessors) transported
    hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our
    acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for
    liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to
    or disposing at the sites. Proceedings arising under Superfund
    typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste
    transportation



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

    (Continued)

and disposal companies and seek to allocate or recover costs
    associated with site investigation and remediation, which costs
    could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial statements. At some of the sites at
    which we have been identified as a PRP, our liability is well
    defined as a consequence of a governmental decision and an
    agreement among liable parties as to the share each will pay for
    implementing that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has
    been selected or the liable parties have been unable to agree on
    an appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain. Any
    of these matters potentially could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Litigation

— In April 2002, two former
    participants in WM Holdings’ ERISA plans filed a
    lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Columbia in a case entitled

William S. Harris, et al. v.
    James E. Koenig, et al

. The lawsuit named as defendants
    WM Holdings; various members of WM Holdings’
    Board of Directors prior to the acquisition of WM Holdings
    by WMI, including Pastora San Juan Cafferty, Steven
    Rothmeier and John C. Pope, each of whom is currently a director
    of WMI; the Administrative Committee of WM Holdings’
    ERISA plans and its individual members, which included former
    officers and directors of WM Holdings; various members of
    the Administrative Committee of WMI’s ERISA plans,
    including former officers of WMI; various members of the
    Investment Committee of WMI’s ERISA plans, including former
    officers of WMI and Robert G. Simpson; and State Street
    Bank & Trust, the trustee and investment manager of
    WMI’s ERISA plans. The lawsuit attempts to increase the
    recovery of a class of ERISA plan participants based on
    allegations related to both the events alleged in, and the
    settlements relating to, the securities class action against
    WM Holdings that was settled in 1998 and the securities
    class action against WMI that was settled in 2001. Subsequently,
    the issues related to the latter class action have been dropped
    as to WMI and all of its current and former officers and
    directors, including Mr. Simpson. The case is ongoing with
    respect to the other defendants, including Ms. Cafferty,
    Mr. Rothmeier and Mr. Pope, in their capacities as
    former directors of WM Holdings. All of the defendants
    intend to defend themselves vigorously.

There are two separate wage and hour lawsuits pending against
    certain of our subsidiaries in California, each seeking class
    certification. The actions have recently been coordinated to
    proceed in San Diego County. Both lawsuits make the same
    general allegations that the defendants failed to comply with
    certain California wage and hour laws, including allegedly
    failing to provide meal and rest periods, and failing to
    properly pay hourly and overtime wages. Similarly, a purported
    class action lawsuit was filed against WMI in August 2008 in
    federal court in Minnesota alleging that we violated the Fair
    Labor Standards Act. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss,
    alleging lack of jurisdiction. We deny all of these claims and
    intend to vigorously defend these matters. As the litigation is
    in the early stages of the legal process, and given the inherent
    uncertainties of litigation, the ultimate outcome cannot be
    predicted at this time, nor can possible damages, if any, be
    reasonably estimated.

From time to time, we also are named as defendants in personal
    injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class
    actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported
    waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have
    contaminated the environment or, in certain cases, on the basis
    of having conducted environmental remediation activities at
    sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of
    monitoring of allegedly affected sites and health care
    examinations of allegedly affected persons for a substantial
    period of time even where no actual damage is proven. While we
    believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, the
    ultimate resolution is often substantially uncertain due to the
    difficulty of determining the cause, extent and impact of
    alleged contamination (which may have occurred over a long
    period of time), the potential for successive groups of
    complainants to emerge, the diversity of the individual
    plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential contribution
    or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or other third
    parties, among other factors. Accordingly, it is possible such
    matters could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

As a large company with operations across the United States and
    Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits,
    disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our
    business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal
    issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against
    us include commercial, customer, and employment-related claims,
    including purported class action lawsuits related to our
    customer service agreements and purported class actions
    involving federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The
    plaintiffs in



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or
    both. These actions are in various procedural stages, and some
    are covered in part by insurance. We currently do not believe
    that any such actions will ultimately have a material adverse
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

WMI’s charter and bylaws currently require indemnification
    of its officers and directors if statutory standards of conduct
    have been met and allow the advancement of expenses to these
    individuals upon receipt of an undertaking by the individuals to
    repay all expenses if it is ultimately determined that they did
    not meet the required standards of conduct. Additionally, WMI
    has entered into separate indemnification agreements with each
    of the members of its Board of Directors as well as its Chief
    Executive Officer, its President and its Chief Financial
    Officer. The Company may incur substantial expenses in
    connection with the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and
    indemnification obligations in connection with current actions
    involving former officers of the Company or its subsidiaries or
    other actions or proceedings, including the

Harris

lawsuit mentioned above, that may be brought against its
    former or current officers, directors and employees.

On March 20, 2008, we filed a lawsuit in state court in the
    Southern District of Texas against SAP AG and SAP America, Inc.,
    alleging fraud and breach of contract. The lawsuit relates to
    our 2005 software license from SAP for a waste and recycling
    revenue management system and agreement for SAP to implement the
    software on a fixed-fee basis. We have alleged that SAP
    contracted to provide software that would not need to be
    customized or enhanced and that the software would be fully
    implemented throughout the Company in 18 months. We are
    pursuing all legal remedies, including recovery of all payments
    we have made, costs we have incurred and savings not realized.
    SAP filed a general denial to the suit. Discovery is ongoing and
    we have been assigned a trial date of October 2009. We are
    vigorously pursuing all claims available.

We are still examining all of our alternatives associated with
    the development and implementation of a revenue management
    system, some of which may be affected by the ultimate resolution
    of the lawsuit. As we continue to assess the alternatives
    available to us, we may determine that the best course of action
    will be to move forward with another software and abandon the
    SAP revenue management system. If we decide to abandon the SAP
    software, the abandonment would result in an impairment charge
    of between $45 million and $55 million.

Item 103 of the SEC’s

Regulation S-K

requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a
    governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the
    proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we
    reasonably believe could exceed $100,000. The following matter
    pending as of December 31, 2008 is disclosed in accordance
    with that requirement:

On April 4, 2006, the EPA issued a Finding and Notice of
    Violation (“FNOV”) to Waste Management of Hawaii,
    Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI, and to the
    City and County of Honolulu for alleged violations of the
    federal Clean Air Act, based on alleged failure to submit
    certain reports and design plans required by the EPA, and the
    failure to begin and timely complete the installation of a gas
    collection and control system for the Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary
    Landfill on Oahu. The FNOV did not propose a penalty amount and
    the parties have been in confidential settlement negotiations.
    Pursuant to an indemnity agreement, any penalty assessed will be
    paid by the Company, and not by the City and County of Honolulu.

Multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans

—
    Over 20% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining
    agreements, which are with various union locals across the
    United States. As a result of some of these agreements, certain
    of our subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of
    trustee-managed multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans
    for the affected employees. One of the most significant
    multi-employer pension plans in which we participate is the
    Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan
    (“Central States Pension Plan”), which has reported
    that it adopted a rehabilitation plan as a result of its
    actuarial certification for the plan year beginning
    January 1, 2008. The Central States Pension Plan is in
    “critical status,” as defined by the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006.

In connection with our ongoing re-negotiation of various
    collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate
    for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these
    pension plans. In 2008, we



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

recognized an aggregate charge of $39 million to
    “Operating” expenses for the withdrawal of certain
    bargaining units from multi-employer pension plans, including a
    $35 million charge resulting from our partial withdrawal
    from the Central States Pension Plan. We do not believe that our
    withdrawals from the multi-employer plans, individually or in
    the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or liquidity. However, withdrawals of other
    bargaining units in the future could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations for the period in which any
    such withdrawals were recorded.

Tax matters

— During 2008, we settled IRS
    audits for the 2006 and 2007 tax years, as well as various state
    tax audits. In addition, we settled Canadian audits for tax
    years 2002 through 2005. As a result of these audit settlements,
    we recognized a $26 million net benefit as a reduction to
    our provision for income taxes. We are currently in the
    examination phase of an IRS audit for the 2008 tax year. We
    expect this audit to be completed within the next
    12 months. Audits associated with state and local
    jurisdictions date back to 1999 and examinations associated with
    Canada date back to 1998. To provide for certain potential tax
    exposures, we maintain a liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, the balance of which management believes is adequate.
    Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities could have a
    material effect on our quarterly or annual cash flows as audits
    are completed, although we do not believe that current tax audit
    matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of
    operations.

As discussed in Note 7 we have approximately
    $2.9 billion of tax-exempt financings as of
    December 31, 2008. Tax-exempt financings are structured
    pursuant to certain terms and conditions of the Internal Revenue
    Code, which exempt from taxation the interest income earned by
    the bondholders in the transactions. The requirements of the
    Code can be complex, and failure to comply with these
    requirements could cause certain past interest payments made on
    the bonds to be taxable and could cause either outstanding
    principal amounts on the bonds to be accelerated or future
    interest payments on the bonds to be taxable. Some of the
    Company’s tax-exempt financings have been, or currently
    are, the subject of examinations by the IRS to determine whether
    the financings meet the requirements of the Code and applicable
    regulations. It is possible that an adverse determination by the
    IRS could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    cash flows and results of operations.

Restructuring

2008 and 2009 Restructurings —

The
    $2 million of restructuring expenses recognized during 2008
    was related to a reorganization of customer service functions in
    our Western Group and the realignment of certain operations in
    our Southern Group. Refer to Note 24 for a discussion of
    our ongoing 2009 restructuring activities.

2007 Restructuring and Realignment

— In the
    first quarter of 2007, we restructured certain operations and
    functions, resulting in the recognition of a charge of
    approximately $9 million. We incurred an additional
    $1 million of costs for this restructuring during the
    second quarter of 2007, increasing the costs incurred to date to
    $10 million. Approximately $7 million of our
    restructuring costs was incurred by our Corporate organization,
    $2 million was incurred by our Midwest Group and
    $1 million was incurred by our Western Group. These charges
    included approximately $8 million for employee severance
    and benefit costs and approximately $2 million related to
    operating lease agreements.

Through December 31, 2008, we had paid approximately
    $8 million of the employee severance and benefit costs
    incurred as a result of this restructuring. The length of time
    we are obligated to make severance payments varies, with the
    longest obligation continuing through the first quarter of 2009.
    These first quarter 2009 payments amount to less than
    $1 million.

(Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale
    impairments)

— The net gains from divestitures in
    all three years were a result of our fix-or-seek-exit
    initiative. In 2008, these gains were primarily related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our
    Southern Group; in 2007, the gains were related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection, transfer and
    recycling operations in our Eastern, Western, Southern and WMRA
    Groups; and in 2006, the gains were primarily related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our
    Western Group. Gains recognized from divestitures in 2006 were
    partially offset by the recognition of aggregate impairment
    charges of $18 million, which were principally recognized
    by our Eastern Group, for business operations held for sale as
    required by SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.

Impairments of assets held-for-use

— During
    2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge
    primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our
    Southern Group. During 2007, we recognized $12 million in
    impairment charges due to impairments recognized for two
    landfills in our Southern Group. The impairments were necessary
    as a result of the re-evaluation of our business alternatives
    for one landfill and the expiration of a contract that we had
    expected would be renewed that had significantly contributed to
    the volumes for the second landfill. The $24 million of
    impairment charges recognized during 2006 was primarily related
    to the impairment of a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result
    of a change in our expectations for future expansions and the
    impairment of under-performing operations in our WMRA Group.

Other

— In 2006, we recognized a
    $26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration ruling
    against us related to the termination of a joint venture
    relationship in 2000.

Capital
    Stock, Share Repurchases and Dividends

Capital
    stock

As of December 31, 2008, we have 490.7 million shares
    of common stock issued and outstanding. We have 1.5 billion
    shares of authorized common stock with a par value of $0.01 per
    common share. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue
    preferred stock in series, and with respect to each series, to
    fix its designation, relative rights (including voting,
    dividend, conversion, sinking fund, and redemption rights),
    preferences (including dividends and liquidation) and
    limitations. We have ten million shares of authorized preferred
    stock, $0.01 par value, none of which is currently
    outstanding.

Share
    repurchases

In 2004, our Board of Directors approved a capital allocation
    plan that allowed for up to $1.2 billion in annual share
    repurchases, and dividend payments, for each of 2005, 2006 and
    2007. In June 2006, our Board of Directors approved up to
    $350 million of additional share repurchases for 2006; in
    March 2007, approved up to $600 million of additional share
    repurchases for 2007; and in November 2007, approved up to
    $300 million of additional share repurchases, which was not
    limited to any calendar year. As a result, the maximum amount of
    capital allocated to our share repurchases and dividend payments
    in 2007 was $2.1 billion. All share repurchases in 2006 and
    2007 were made pursuant to these Board authorized capital
    allocation plans.

In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a capital
    allocation program that included the authorization for up to
    $1.4 billion in combined cash dividends and common stock
    repurchases in 2008. Approximately $184 million of the
    November 2007 increased authorization of $300 million
    remained available for repurchases at December 31, 2007. In
    July 2008, we suspended our share repurchases in connection with
    our proposal to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Republic
    Services, Inc. When the proposal was withdrawn in October 2008,
    we determined that, given the state of the financial markets, it
    would be prudent to suspend repurchases for the foreseeable
    future. As a result, the share repurchases made during 2008 are
    significantly less than that which was authorized.

In December 2008, our Board of Directors approved a capital
    allocation program for the authorization of up to
    $1.3 billion in combined cash dividends, common stock
    repurchases, debt reduction and acquisitions.

Our 2006 share repurchase activity included

    accelerated share repurchase transaction. The number of shares
    we repurchased under the accelerated repurchase transaction was
    determined by dividing $275 million by the fair market
    value of our common stock on the repurchase date. At the end of
    the valuation period, which was in February 2006, we were
    required to make a settlement payment for the difference between
    the $275 million paid at the inception of the valuation
    period and the weighted average daily market price of our common
    stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we
    repurchased, or $16 million. We elected to make the
    required settlement payment in cash.

In December 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors
    expects to increase the per share quarterly dividend from $0.27
    to $0.29 for dividends declared in 2009. However, all future
    dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net
    earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business
    plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which employees
    that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase
    shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for
    two offering periods for purchases: January through June and
    July through December. At the end of each offering period,
    employees are able to purchase shares of common stock at a price
    equal to 85% of the lesser of the market value of the stock on
    the first and last day of such offering period. The purchases
    are made through payroll deductions, and the number of shares
    that may be purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The total
    number of shares issued under the plan for the offering periods
    in each of 2008, 2007 and 2006 was approximately 839,000,
    713,000, and 644,000, respectively. Including the impact of the
    January 2009 issuance of shares associated with the July to
    December 2008 offering period, approximately 470,000 shares
    remain available for issuance under the plan.

Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is “compensatory”
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

. Accordingly, beginning with our
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 we
    recognize compensation expense associated with our
    employees’ participation in the Stock Purchase Plan. Our
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan increased annual compensation
    expense by approximately $6 million, or $4 million net
    of tax, for 2008 and approximately $5 million, or
    $3 million net of tax, for both 2007 and 2006.

Employee
    Stock Incentive Plans

Pursuant to our stock incentive plan, we have the ability to
    issue stock options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights,
    all on terms and conditions determined by the Management
    Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

Since May 2004, all stock-based compensation awards described
    herein have been made under the Company’s 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan, which authorizes the issuance of a maximum of
    34 million shares of our common stock. We currently utilize
    treasury shares to meet the needs of our equity-based
    compensation programs under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and to
    settle outstanding awards granted pursuant to previous incentive
    plans.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

As a result of both the changes in accounting required by
    SFAS No. 123(R) for share-based payments and a desire
    to design our long-term incentive plans in a manner that creates
    a stronger link to operating and market performance, the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee approved a
    substantial change in the form of awards that we grant. Through
    December 31, 2004, stock option awards were the primary
    form of equity-based compensation. Beginning in 2005, annual
    stock option grants were eliminated and, for key members of our
    management and operations personnel, replaced with grants of
    restricted stock units and performance share units. The
    Management Development and Compensation Committee subsequently
    determined that the equity-based compensation granted to the
    Company’s senior leadership should all be linked to the
    Company’s financial performance. Accordingly, beginning
    with the 2008 annual equity grant, the awards granted to the
    Company’s senior leadership team are 100% performance share
    units. The Company also grants restricted stock units to
    employees working on key initiatives and in connection with new
    hires and promotions.

Restricted stock units —

During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we granted approximately 359,000
    restricted stock units. Restricted stock units provide award
    recipients with dividend equivalents during the vesting period,
    but the units may not be voted or sold until time-based vesting
    restrictions have lapsed. Restricted stock units granted prior
    to 2007 vest ratably over a four-year period. In 2007, the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee changed the
    terms of the restricted stock units granted to provide for
    three-year cliff vesting. Unvested units are subject to
    forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination.
    Restricted stock units are subject to pro-rata vesting upon an
    employee’s retirement or involuntary termination other than
    for cause and become immediately vested in the event of an
    employee’s death or disability.

Compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is
    measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock
    and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required
    employment period, which is generally the vesting period.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    current period and historical forfeitures.

    $14 million and $7 million, respectively.

Performance share units —

During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we granted approximately 1,169,000
    performance share units. The performance share units are payable
    in shares of common stock based on the achievement of certain
    financial measures, after the end of a three-year performance
    period. At the end of the three-year period, the number of
    shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the targeted amount.
    Performance share units have no voting rights and performance
    share units granted prior to 2007 received no dividend
    equivalents during the required performance period. Beginning in
    2007, dividend equivalents are paid out in cash based on actual
    performance at the end of the awards’ performance period.
    Performance share units are payable to an employee (or his
    beneficiary) upon death or disability as if that employee had
    remained employed until the end of

the performance period, are subject to pro-rata vesting upon an
    employee’s retirement or involuntary termination other than
    for cause and are subject to forfeiture in the event of
    voluntary or for-cause termination.

Compensation expense associated with performance share units
    that continue to vest based on future performance is measured
    based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock, net of
    the present value of expected dividend payments on our common
    stock during the vesting period. Compensation expense is
    recognized ratably over the performance period based on our
    estimated achievement of the established performance criteria.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    both the probability that the performance criteria will be
    achieved and current period and historical forfeitures.

The units that vested in 2008 were subject to a three-year
    performance target that was established in 2005 when the awards
    were granted. The Company’s financial results for the
    three-year period, as measured for purposes of these awards, was
    lower than the target level established. Accordingly, we issued
    approximately 561,000 shares, or 91% of the target, upon
    the vesting of these awards. The shares issued upon the vesting
    of these awards had a fair market value of $19 million. The
    Company’s performance exceeded the target level established
    for the awards that vested in 2007. Accordingly, we issued
    approximately 65,000 shares with a fair market value of
    $2 million upon the vesting of these awards.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
    recognized $42 million, $31 million and
    $21 million, respectively, of compensation expense
    associated with restricted stock unit and performance share unit
    awards as a component of “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. Our “Provision for income taxes” for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include a
    related deferred income tax benefit of $16 million,
    $12 million and $8 million, respectively. We have not
    capitalized any equity-based compensation costs during the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. As of
    December 31, 2008, we estimate that a total of
    approximately $43 million of currently unrecognized
    compensation expense will be recognized in future periods for
    unvested restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards
    issued and outstanding. This expense is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
    1.7 years.

Stock options —

Prior to 2005, stock options
    were the primary form of equity-based compensation we granted to
    our employees. On December 16, 2005, the Management
    Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors
    approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock
    options awarded under our stock incentive plans effective
    December 28, 2005.

Our non-employee directors receive annual grants of shares of

    there currently are approximately 377,000 shares remaining
    available for issuance under the plan. However, it is the
    Company’s current intent to utilize common stock grants,
    which will be issued under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or any
    successor plans, for director compensation.

The following table reconciles the number of common shares
    outstanding at December 31 of each year to the number of
    weighted average basic common shares outstanding and the number
    of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the
    purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per common
    share. The table also provides the number of shares of common
    stock potentially issuable at the end of each period and the
    number of potentially issuable shares excluded from the diluted

Fair
    Value Measurements

SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for measuring fair
    value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
    the inputs used to measure fair value, giving the highest
    priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the
    lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring
    the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data
    or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in
    pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk
    when appropriate. As of December 31, 2008, our assets and
    liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
    include the following (in millions):

(a)

These assets include (i) restricted trusts and escrow
    accounts invested in money market mutual funds;
    (ii) restricted trusts and escrow accounts invested in
    equity-based mutual funds, which are discussed further below;
    and (iii) other equity securities, which are discussed
    further below.

(b)

Changes in the fair value of these assets are generally related
    to (i) revisions in our estimates of the cost to remediate
    a site because the amounts owed by third parties are directly
    related to the underlying environmental remediation liabilities;
    (ii) receipt of funds from third parties;
    (iii) changes in our expectations for the recovery of the
    balances; (iv) the accretion of interest income; and
    (v) changes in the applicable discount rates due to either
    fluctuations in market interest rates or changes in the
    credit-worthiness of our counterparties. There have not been any
    material changes in these fair value measurements during 2008.

We have determined the estimated fair value amounts of our
    financial instruments using available market information and
    commonly accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable
    judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
    estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not
    necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the
    instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use
    of different assumptions

and/or

estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the
    estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on
    information available as of December 31, 2008. These
    amounts have not been revalued since that date, and current
    estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the
    amounts presented.

Cash and cash equivalents and

available-for-sale

securities are reflected at fair value in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements. The carrying values of trade accounts
    receivable, trade accounts payable and other receivables are
    reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at historical
    cost, which is materially representative of their fair value
    principally because of the short-term maturities of these
    instruments.

Long-term investments

— The cost basis of
    restricted trusts and escrow accounts invested in equity-based
    mutual funds and other equity securities was $77 million as
    of December 31, 2008 and $73 million at
    December 31, 2007. Unrealized holding gains and losses on
    these instruments are recorded as either an increase or decrease
    to the asset balance and deferred as a component of
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income” in the equity
    section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized
    holding losses on these instruments, net of taxes, were
    $2 million as of December 31, 2008 and the net
    unrealized holding gains on these instruments, net of taxes,
    were



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

$5 million as of December 31, 2007. The fair value of
    our remaining

available-for-sale

securities approximates our cost basis in the investments.

Debt and interest rate derivatives

— At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying value of our debt
    was approximately $8.3 billion. The carrying value includes
    adjustments for both the unamortized fair value adjustments
    related to terminated hedge arrangements and fair value
    adjustments of debt instruments that are currently hedged. For
    active hedge arrangements, the fair value of the derivative is
    included in other current assets, other long-term assets,
    accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as
    appropriate.

The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately
    $7.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and approximately
    $8.5 billion at December 31, 2007. The estimated fair
    value of our senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The
    carrying value of remarketable debt approximates fair value due
    to the short-term nature of the attached interest rates. The
    fair value of our other debt is estimated using discounted cash
    flow analysis, based on rates we would currently pay for similar
    types of instruments. The significant decline in the fair value
    of our debt when comparing 2008 with 2007 is primarily related
    to (i) the sharp decrease in market prices for corporate
    debt securities in late 2008 due to the overall condition of the
    credit markets, which caused a substantial decrease in the fair
    value of our publicly-traded senior notes; and (ii) a
    significant increase in current market rates on fixed-rate
    tax-exempt bonds.

18.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

Acquisitions

We continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are
    accretive to our solid waste operations and enhance and expand
    our existing service offerings. We have seen the greatest
    opportunities for realizing superior returns from tuck-in
    acquisitions, which are primarily the purchases of collection
    operations that enhance our existing route structures and are
    strategically located near our existing disposal operations.
    During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we
    completed several acquisitions for a cost, net of cash acquired,
    of $280 million, $90 million, and $32 million,
    respectively.

Divestitures

The aggregate sales price for divestitures of operations was
    $59 million in 2008, $224 million in 2007, and
    $184 million in 2006. The proceeds from these sales were
    comprised substantially of cash. We recognized net gains on
    these divestitures of $33 million in 2008, $59 million
    in 2007, and $26 million in 2006. These divestitures have
    been made as part of our initiative to improve or divest certain
    under-performing and non-strategic operations. As disclosed in
    Note 3, we analyze operations that have been divested in
    order to determine if they qualify for discontinued operations
    reporting. We have determined that the operations that qualify
    for discontinued operations accounting are not material to our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Additional information
    related to our divestitures activity is included in Note 12.

Variable
    Interest Entities

We have financial interests in various variable interest
    entities. Following is a description of all interests that we
    consider significant. For purposes of applying FASB
    Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, we are
    considered the primary beneficiary of certain of these entities.
    Such entities have been consolidated into our financial
    statements as noted below.

Consolidated
    variable interest entities

Waste-to-Energy

LLCs

— On June 30, 2000, two limited
    liability companies were established to purchase interests in
    existing leveraged lease financings at three

waste-to-energy

facilities that we lease, operate and maintain. We own a 0.5%
    interest in one of the LLCs (“LLC I”) and a 0.25%
    interest in the second LLC (“LLC II”). John Hancock
    Life Insurance Company owns 99.5% of LLC I and 99.75% of LLC II
    is owned by LLC I and the CIT Group. In 2000, Hancock and CIT
    made an initial investment of $167 million in the LLCs,
    which was used to



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

purchase the three

waste-to-energy

facilities and assume the seller’s indebtedness. Under the
    LLC agreements, the LLCs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence
    of any of the following events: (i) a written decision of
    all members of the LLCs; (ii) December 31, 2063;
    (iii) a court’s dissolution of the LLCs; or
    (iv) the LLCs ceasing to own any interest in the

waste-to-energy

facilities.

Income, losses and cash flows of the LLCs are allocated to the
    members based on their initial capital account balances until
    Hancock and CIT achieve targeted returns; thereafter, we will
    receive 80% of the earnings of each of the LLCs and Hancock and
    CIT will be allocated the remaining 20% based on their
    respective equity interests. All capital allocations made
    through December 31, 2008 have been based on initial
    capital account balances as the target returns have not yet been
    achieved.

Our obligations associated with our interests in the LLCs are
    primarily related to the lease of the facilities. In addition to
    our minimum lease payment obligations, we are required to make
    cash payments to the LLCs for differences between fair market
    rents and our minimum lease payments. These payments are subject
    to adjustment based on factors that include the fair market
    value of rents for the facilities and lease payments made
    through the re-measurement dates. In addition, we may be
    required under certain circumstances to make capital
    contributions to the LLCs based on differences between the fair
    market value of the facilities and defined termination values as
    provided for by the underlying lease agreements, although we
    believe the likelihood of the occurrence of these circumstances
    is remote.

We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the LLCs
    because our interest in the entities is subject to variability
    based on changes in the fair market value of the leased
    facilities, while Hancock’s and CIT’s interests are
    structured to provide targeted returns based on their respective
    initial investments. As of December 31, 2008, our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $342 million of net
    property and equipment associated with the LLCs’

waste-to-energy

facilities and $228 million in minority interest associated
    with Hancock’s and CIT’s interests in the LLCs. During
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
    recognized minority interest expense of $41 million,
    $35 million and $33 million, respectively, for
    Hancock’s and CIT’s interests in the LLCs’
    earnings, which are largely eliminated in WMI’s
    consolidation.

Trusts for Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation
    Obligations

— We have determined that we are the
    primary beneficiary of trust funds that were created to settle
    certain of our closure, post-closure or environmental
    remediation obligations. Although we are not always the sole
    beneficiary of these trust funds, we have determined that we are
    the primary beneficiary because we retain a majority of the
    risks and rewards associated with changes in the fair value of
    the assets held in trust. As the trust funds are expected to
    continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were
    established, we do not believe that there is any material
    exposure to loss associated with the trusts. The consolidation
    of these variable interest entities has not materially affected
    our financial position or results of operations.

Significant
    unconsolidated variable interest entities

Investments in Coal-Based Synthetic Fuel Production
    Facilities

— As discussed in Note 8, through
    December 31, 2007, we owned an interest in two coal-based
    synthetic fuel production facilities. Along with the other
    equity investors, we supported the operations of the entities in
    exchange for a pro-rata share of the tax credits generated by
    the facilities. Our obligation to support the facilities’
    operations was, therefore, limited to the tax benefit we
    received. We were not the primary beneficiary of either of these
    entities. As such, we accounted for these investments under the
    equity method of accounting and did not consolidate the
    facilities.

Segment
    and Related Information

We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and WMRA
    Groups. These six Groups are presented below as our reportable
    segments. Our segments provide integrated waste management
    services consisting of collection, disposal (solid waste and
    hazardous waste landfills), transfer,

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants that are
    managed by Wheelabrator, recycling services and other services
    to commercial, industrial, municipal and

During the second quarter of 2008, we moved certain Canadian
    business operations from the Western Group to the Midwest Group
    to facilitate improved business execution. The prior period
    segment information provided in the following table has been
    reclassified to reflect the impact of this change to provide

    costs previously reported by the Corporate and Other segment. In
    2007, the quantity of fleet purchases previously reported by the

Quarterly
    Financial Data (Unaudited)

Fluctuations in our operating results between quarters may be
    caused by many factors, including

period-to-period

changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of
    business and operating segment and general economic conditions.
    In addition, our revenues and income from operations typically
    reflect seasonal patterns. Our operating revenues tend to be
    somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the
    higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes
    of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we
    operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our
    second and third quarter revenues and results of operations
    typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain
    destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the
    second half of the year, such as hurricanes generally
    experienced by our Southern Group actually increase our revenues
    in the areas affected. However, for several reasons, including
    significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
    Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
    months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

    necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted earnings
    per common share amounts.

From time to time, our operating results are significantly
    affected by unusual or infrequent transactions or events. The
    following significant and unusual items have affected the
    comparison of our operating results during the periods presented:

First
    Quarter 2008

•

Net income was positively affected by a $6 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes”
    recognized as a result of the settlement of tax audits.

Second
    Quarter 2008

•

Net income was positively affected by (i) a $7 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes”
    recognized as a result of the settlement of tax audits; and
    (ii) a $10 million net reduction in “Interest
    expense,” or $6 million net of tax, for the immediate
    recognition of fair value adjustments associated with terminated
    interest rate swaps related to our $244 million of
    8.75% senior notes that were repaid in May 2008, but would
    have matured in 2018.

Third
    Quarter 2008

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a $23 million net credit to “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” due to $26 million of gains from divestitures
    of underperforming collection operations in our Southern Group,
    offset in part by a $3 million impairment charge recognized
    as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our Southern
    Group. These items positively affected net income for the period
    by $14 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    $26 million of increased “Operating” expenses due
    to a labor disruption associated with the renegotiation of a
    collective bargaining agreement in Milwaukee,

Wisconsin and the related agreement of the bargaining unit to
    withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund. These charges
    negatively affected net income for the period by
    $16 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.

Fourth
    Quarter 2008

•

Income from operations was positively affected by (i) a
    $6 million reduction in landfill amortization expenses
    associated with changes in our expectations for the timing and
    cost of future final capping, closure and post-closure of fully
    utilized airspace; and (ii) the recognition of a
    $5 million net credit to “(Income) expense from
    divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the
    divestiture of operations, principally in our Midwest Group.
    These items positively affected net income for the period by
    $6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    (i) $24 million of increased “Operating”
    expenses due to labor disruptions associated with the
    renegotiation of various collective bargaining agreements and
    the related withdrawal of the bargaining units from
    multi-employer pension plans; and (ii) a $33 million
    charge to “Operating” expenses as a result of a
    decrease in the risk-free interest rate used to discount our
    environmental remediation liabilities. The charge to
    “Operating” expenses associated with the change in the
    discount rate used for our environmental remediation liabilities
    resulted in a $6 million decrease in minority interest
    expense during the period. Collectively, these items negatively
    affected net income for the period by $30 million, or
    $0.06 per diluted share.

•

Net income was positively affected by a $13 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes”
    recognized as a result of tax audit settlements.

First
    Quarter 2007

•

Income from operations was improved by $15 million due to
    the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern
    Group, which was recognized as a reduction to disposal fees and
    taxes within our “Operating” expenses. The resolution
    of this matter also increased “Interest income” for
    the quarter by $7 million. These items positively affected
    net income for the period by $13 million, or $0.02 per
    diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by (i) a
    $21 million charge to “Operating” expenses for
    the early termination of a lease agreement in connection with
    the purchase of one of our independent power production plants;
    (ii) a $10 million charge to “(Income) expense
    from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for
    impairment charges associated with two landfills in our Southern
    Group; and (iii) a $9 million
    “Restructuring” charge incurred to support a
    realignment of certain operations. These charges negatively
    affected net income for the period by $24 million, or $0.05
    per diluted share.

•

Net income was positively affected by a $16 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes”
    recognized as a result of the settlement of tax audits.

Second
    Quarter 2007

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a $33 million net credit to “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” due to gains from divestitures as a result of our

fix-or-seek-exit

initiative. These gains positively affected net income for the
    period by $17 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.

•

Net income was positively affected by a $22 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes” related
    to (i) an $11 million credit recognized for the
    settlement of tax audits; (ii) an $8 million tax
    benefit related to the expected utilization of state net
    operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits; and
    (iii) a $3 million tax benefit related to scheduled
    tax rate reductions in Canada.

Third
    Quarter 2007

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    $26 million, principally for increased
    “Operating” expenses, due to a labor dispute in
    Oakland, California and, to a much lesser extent, the management
    of labor disputes and collective bargaining agreements in other
    parts of California. Costs incurred were largely related to
    security efforts and the deployment and lodging costs incurred
    for replacement workers who were brought to Oakland from across
    the organization. These costs negatively affected net income for
    the period by $16 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.

Fourth
    Quarter 2007

•

Income from operations was positively affected by (i) the
    recognition of a $14 million net credit to “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” due to gains from divestitures as a result of our

fix-or-seek-exit

initiative; and (ii) a $18 million reduction in
    landfill amortization expenses associated with changes in our
    expectations for the timing and cost of future final capping,
    closure and post-closure of fully utilized airspace. These items
    positively affected net income for the period by
    $19 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    $8 million, principally for increased “Operating”
    expenses, due to labor disruptions in California. These costs
    negatively affected net income for the period by
    $5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

•

Net income was positively affected by a $38 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes” related
    to (i) a $10 million credit recognized for the
    settlement of tax audits; (ii) a $27 million tax
    benefit related to scheduled tax rate reductions in Canada; and
    (iii) a $1 million tax benefit related to the expected
    utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards and state
    tax credits.

WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

New
    Accounting Pronouncements (Unaudited)

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position

FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those
    that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
    Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008, we have not applied
    the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to our asset retirement
    obligations, which are accounted for under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 143. FSP

FAS 157-2

establishes January 1, 2009 as the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to these fair value
    measurements for the Company. We do not currently expect the
    application of the fair value framework established by
    SFAS No. 157 to non-financial assets and liabilities
    measured on a non-recurring basis to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements. However, we will continue
    to assess the potential effects of SFAS No. 157 as
    additional guidance becomes available.

SFAS No. 141(R) —
    Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

, which establishes
    principles for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in the
    financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the
    acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for recognizing
    and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination
    and determines what information to disclose to enable users of
    the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R)
    is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The
    portions of the statement that relate to business combinations
    completed before the effective date will not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, our
    adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will significantly impact
    our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions,
    principally as a result of (i) expanded requirements to
    value acquired assets, liabilities and contingencies at their
    fair values; and (ii) the requirement that
    acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be
    expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the
    cost of the acquisition.

SFAS No. 160 —
    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB
    No. 51

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It states that a noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
    consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the
    consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 will
    be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009 and
    must be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively
    for all periods presented. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements. However, it could impact our
    accounting for future transactions.

24.

Subsequent
    Event (Unaudited)

In February 2009, we announced that we were taking steps to
    further streamline our organization by consolidating many of our
    Market Areas. As a result of our restructuring, the 45 separate
    Market Areas that we previously operated have been consolidated
    into 25 Areas. We have found that our larger Market Areas
    generally were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of
    scale that were not present in our smaller Market Areas, and
    believe that this reorganization will allow us to lower costs
    and continue to standardize processes and improve productivity.
    It is also a proactive measure to ensure that we will continue
    to have the ability to operate efficiently and effectively in
    difficult economic times.

We currently estimate that this restructuring will eliminate
    over 1,000 employee positions throughout the Company and
    result in a restructuring charge of between $40 million and
    $50 million, principally for employee severance and benefit
    costs. We expect to recognize the majority of this charge during
    the first quarter of 2009.



Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Effectiveness
    of Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed
    to ensure that information we are required to disclose in
    reports that we file or submit with the SEC is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified by the SEC. An evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
    of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
    as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
    to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
    disclosed by us in reports we file with the SEC is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    required by the SEC, and is accumulated and communicated to
    management including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
    timely decisions regarding disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management’s report on our internal control over financial
    reporting can be found in Item 8,

Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data,

of this report. The Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm’s attestation report on
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting can also be found in
    Item 8 of this report.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes
    in our internal control over financial reporting during the
    quarter ended December 31, 2008. We determined that there
    were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
