PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
    our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
    variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary. Waste Management, Inc. is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries.
    When the terms “the Company,” “we,”
    “us” or “our” are used in this document,
    those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
    subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When
    we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to the
    parent holding company.

WMI was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name
    “USA Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a
    Delaware company in 1995. In a 1998 merger, the Illinois-based
    waste services company formerly known as Waste Management, Inc.
    became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI and changed its name to
    Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”).
    At the same time, our parent holding company changed its name
    from USA Waste Services to Waste Management, Inc. Like WMI,
    WM Holdings is a holding company and all operations are
    conducted by subsidiaries. For detail on the financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows of WMI, WM Holdings
    and their subsidiaries, see Note 23 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
    Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone
    number at that address is

(713) 512-6200.

are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as
    practicable after we file the reports with the SEC. Our stock is
    traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
    “WM.”

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and

waste-to-energy

services. In providing these services, we actively pursue
    projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive
    difference for our environment, including recovering and
    processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into
    a renewable energy source. Our customers include commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste
    management companies, electric utilities and governmental
    entities. During 2009, our largest customer represented
    approximately 1% of annual revenues. We employed approximately
    43,400 people as of December 31, 2009.

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers,
    our employees, the environment, the communities in which we
    work, and our stockholders.

Our primary strategy continues to be to improve our organization
    and maximize returns to shareholders by focusing on operational
    excellence, pricing excellence and the profitable growth of our
    business. We believe that creating more efficient operations and
    attracting and retaining customers while ensuring appropriate
    pricing are the steps that provide the foundation for growth. We
    are continuing to focus on pricing and working to lower
    operating and selling, general and administrative expenses
    through process standardization and productivity improvements.
    We also are continuing programs designed to ensure we make the
    best use of our assets and capital to realize returns in
    addition to increasing our operating margins.

We intend to continue to focus on meeting the needs of a
    changing environment. As the largest waste services provider in
    North America, we believe we are well positioned to meet the
    needs of our customers and communities as they, too, Think
    Green

®

.

    We believe that helping our customers achieve their
    environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth.

Our focus on operational excellence has provided us a strong
    foundation on which to build. We intend to take advantage of
    strategic opportunities as they arise and continue to seek
    profitable growth through targeted sales efforts and
    acquisitions. We also continue to seek to grow our business in
    different areas that fit into our current operations. We believe
    that making such investments will provide long-term value to our
    stockholders. In addition, we intend to continue to return value
    to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and
    dividend



payments. We recently announced that our Board of Directors
    expects that future quarterly dividend payments will be
    increased to $0.315 per share in 2010, which is an 8.6% increase
    from the quarterly dividend we paid in 2009. This will result in
    an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to
    pay out as dividends for the seventh straight year, which is an
    indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash
    flows. All future dividend declarations will be made at the
    discretion of our Board of Directors.

Operations

General

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through five
    Groups. Our four geographic Groups, which include our Eastern,
    Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, provide collection,
    transfer, recycling and disposal services. Our fifth Group is
    the Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to-energy

services. We also provide additional services that are not
    managed through our five Groups, as described below. These
    operations are presented in this report as “Other.”

The table below shows the total revenues (in millions)
    contributed annually by each of our Groups, or reportable
    segments, in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009.
    More information about our results of operations by reportable
    segment is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and in

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins
    with a vast waste collection network. Collection involves
    picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from
    where it was generated to a transfer station,



material recovery facility (“MRF”) or disposal site.
    We generally provide collection services under one of two types
    of arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we
    have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the
    agreements are influenced by factors such as collection
    frequency, type of collection equipment we furnish, type and
    volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the
    disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general
    market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel
    containers to most customers to store their solid waste between

pick-up

dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs
    of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many
    are designed to be lifted mechanically and either emptied into a
    truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site.
    By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial
    and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one
    employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract
    with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality,
    homeowners’ association or some other regional authority
    that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of
    the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are
    typically for periods of one to five years. We also provide
    services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to
    households. The fees for residential collection are either paid
    by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or
    service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving
    the service.

Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories
    for solid waste in North America. At December 31, 2009, we
    owned or operated 268 solid waste landfills, which represents
    the largest network of landfills in North America. Solid waste
    landfills are built and operated on land with geological and
    hydrological properties that limit the possibility of water
    pollution, and are operated under prescribed procedures. A
    landfill must be maintained to meet federal, state or
    provincial, and local regulations. The operation and closure of
    a solid waste landfill includes excavation, construction of
    liners, continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering
    of waste with earth or other inert material and constructing
    final capping of the landfill. These operations are carefully
    planned to maintain sanitary conditions, to maximize the use of
    the airspace and to prepare the site so it can ultimately be
    used for other purposes.

All solid waste management companies must have access to a
    disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. We believe it
    is usually preferable for our collection operations to use
    disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer
    to as internalization, rather than using third-party disposal
    facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize
    higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows.
    The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to
    as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including
    competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste
    deposited.

We also operate five secure hazardous waste landfills in the
    United States. Under federal environmental laws, the federal
    government (or states with delegated authority) must issue
    permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous
    waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although
    some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These
    landfills must also comply with specialized operating standards.
    Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets
    regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal
    cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before
    disposal. Generally, these treatments involve the separation or
    removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments
    that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer
    hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed
    and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term
    containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility
    at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by
    injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock
    formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is
    separated by other substantial geological confining layers.

Transfer.

At December 31, 2009, we owned
    or operated 345 transfer stations in North America. We deposit
    waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid
    waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume
    and increase the density of the waste and transported by
    transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect
    waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities.
    Fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually
    based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at
    the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site and
    general market factors.



The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection
    operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain
    fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the
    disposal of the waste we collect. It enables us to manage costs
    associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks,
    railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than
    collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the
    disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated
    and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically
    located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations;
    and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer
    of the waste to one of our own disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally
    are operated through lease agreements under which we lease
    property from third parties. There are some instances where
    transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for
    municipalities. In most cases we own the permits and will be
    responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the
    operation and closure of the transfer station.

Wheelabrator.

As of December 31, 2009, we
    owned or operated 16

waste-to-energy

facilities and five independent power production plants, or
    IPPs, which are located in the Northeast and in Florida,
    California and Washington.

At our

waste-to-energy

facilities, solid waste is burned at high temperatures in
    specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted
    into high-pressure steam. As of December 31, 2009, our

waste-to-energy

facilities were capable of processing up to 21,100 tons of solid
    waste each day. In 2009, our

waste-to-energy

facilities received and processed 7.0 million tons of solid
    waste, or approximately 19,200 tons per day.

Our IPPs convert various waste and conventional fuels into
    steam. The plants burn wood waste, anthracite coal waste (culm),
    tires, landfill gas and natural gas. These facilities are
    integral to the solid waste industry, disposing of urban wood,
    waste tires, railroad ties and utility poles. Our anthracite
    culm facility in Pennsylvania processes the waste materials left
    over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago.
    Ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land
    damaged by decades of coal mining.

We generate steam at our waste-to-energy and IPP facilities for
    the production of electricity. We sell the electricity produced
    at our facilities into wholesale markets, which include
    investor-owned utilities, power marketers and regional power
    pools. Some of our facilities also sell steam directly to end
    users. Fees charged for electricity and steam at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs have generally been subject to the terms and
    conditions of long-term contracts that include interim
    adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market
    conditions such as inflation, electricity and other general
    market factors. In 2009, several of our long-term energy
    contracts and short-term pricing arrangements expired,
    significantly increasing our

waste-to-energy

revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in
    market prices for electricity, which generally correlate with
    fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets where we
    operate. Refer to the

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
    About Market Risk

section of this report for additional
    information about the Company’s current considerations
    related to the management of this market exposure.

Recycling.

Our recycling operations focus on
    improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling
    programs within communities and industries. During the first
    quarter of 2009, we transferred responsibility for the oversight
    of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our
    geographic Groups. Before that, all of our recycling operations
    other than certain services that were embedded within the
    geographic Groups’ other operations had comprised, and been
    reported as, a separate segment. The financial results of our
    material recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities
    are now included as a component of their respective geographic
    Group and the financial results of our recycling brokerage
    business and electronics recycling services are included as part
    of our “Other” operations. We believe that integrating
    the management of our recycling facilities with the remainder of
    our solid waste business ensures that we are focusing on
    maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of
    all aspects of our business and efficiently providing
    comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers.

In 2001, we became the first major solid waste company to focus
    on residential single-stream recycling, which allows customers
    to mix recyclable paper, plastic and glass in one bin.
    Residential single-stream programs have greatly increased the
    recycling rates. Single-stream recycling is possible through the
    use of various mechanized screens and optical sorting
    technologies. We have also been advancing the single-stream
    recycling programs for



commercial applications. Recycling involves the separation of
    reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and
    resale or other disposition. Our recycling operations include
    the following:

Materials processing

— Through our collection
    operations, we collect recyclable materials from residential,
    commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials
    to one of our MRFs for processing. We operate 90 MRFs where
    paper, metals, plastics, glass and other recyclable commodities
    are recovered for resale. We also operate eight secondary
    processing facilities where recyclable materials can be further
    processed into raw products used in the manufacturing of
    consumer goods. Specifically, material processing services
    include data destruction, automated color sorting, and
    construction and demolition processing.

Plastics materials recycling

— Using

state-of-the-art

sorting and processing technology, we process, inventory and
    sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more
    cost effective and convenient.

Commodities recycling

— We market and resell
    recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the
    marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our
    facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that
    continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market demands
    and product quality.

Fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of
    recyclable commodities being processed, the volume or weight of
    the recyclable material, degree of processing required, the
    market value of the recovered material and other market factors.

The recyclable materials processed in our MRFs are purchased
    from various sources, including third parties and our own
    operations. The cost per ton of material purchased is based on
    market prices and the cost to transport the finished goods to
    our customers to whom we sell the materials. The price we pay
    for recyclable materials is often referred to as a
    “rebate.” Rebates generally are based upon the price
    we receive for sales of finished goods and market conditions,
    but in some cases are based on fixed contractual rates or
    defined minimum per-ton rates. As a result, changes in commodity
    prices can significantly affect our revenues, the rebates we pay
    to our suppliers and our operating income and margins.

Other.

Other services not managed within our
    Groups include the following:

We provide recycling brokerage and electronic recycling
    services. Recycling brokerage includes managing the marketing of
    recyclable materials for third parties. The experience of our
    recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our
    own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively
    manage volumes for third parties. Utilizing the resources and
    knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers, we
    can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable
    commodities with little to no capital requirements. We also
    provide electronics recycling. We recycle discarded computers,
    communications equipment, and other electronic equipment.
    Services include the collection, sorting and disassembling of
    electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected
    materials. In recent years, we have teamed with major
    electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive
    “take-back” programs of their products to assist the
    general public in disposing of their old electronics in a
    convenient and environmentally safe manner.

We provide sustainability services to businesses through our
    Upstream

®

and Green Squad organizations. This includes in-plant services,
    where our employees work full-time inside our customers’
    facilities to provide full-service waste management solutions
    and consulting services. Our vertically integrated waste
    management operations enable us to provide customers with full
    management of their waste. The breadth of our service offerings
    and the familiarity we have with waste management practices
    gives us the unique ability to assist customers in identifying
    recycling opportunities, minimizing waste, and determining the
    most efficient means available for waste collection and disposal.

We develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial use
    of landfill gas through our Waste Management Renewable Energy
    Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes
    in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill gas is a
    readily available, renewable energy source that can be gathered
    and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel. The EPA
    endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, in the
    same category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At
    December 31, 2009, landfill gas beneficial use projects
    were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 119 of
    our solid waste landfills. At 87 of these landfills, the



processed gas is delivered to electricity generators. The
    electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal
    utilities or power cooperatives. At 23 landfills, the gas
    is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct
    substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. At nine
    landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality
    natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers.

Our WM Healthcare Solutions subsidiary offers integrated medical
    waste services for healthcare facilities, pharmacies and
    individuals. We provide full-service solutions to facilities to
    assist them in best practices, indentifying waste streams and
    proper disposal. Our healthcare services also include a sharps
    mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose
    of their used syringes and lancets using our MedWaste Tracker
    system.

Although by their very nature many waste management services
    such as collection and disposal are local services, our National
    Accounts program works with customers whose locations span the
    United States. Our National Accounts program provides
    centralized customer service, billing and management of accounts
    to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and
    nationwide locations’ waste management needs.

We also have begun investing in businesses and technologies that
    are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or
    supplementary to our current operations. These investments
    include joint ventures, acquisitions and partial ownership
    interests. The solutions and services include the development,
    operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities;
    operation of a landfill

gas-to-liquid

natural gas plant; solar powered compact trash compactors; and
    organic

waste-to-fuel

conversion technology. Part of our expansion of services
    includes offering portable self-storage services and fluorescent
    bulb and universal waste mail-back through our
    LampTracker

®

program.

Finally, we rent and service portable restroom facilities to
    municipalities and commercial customers under the name
    Port-o-Let

®

,

    and provide street and parking lot sweeping services.

Competition

The solid waste industry is very competitive. Competition comes
    from a number of publicly held solid waste companies, private
    solid waste companies, large commercial and industrial companies
    handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and
    public and private

waste-to-energy

companies. We also have competition from municipalities and
    regional government authorities with respect to residential and
    commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills.

Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely
    throughout the geographic areas in which we operate. The prices
    that we charge are determined locally, and typically vary by the
    volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment
    requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of
    collections, distance to final disposal sites, the availability
    of airspace within the geographic region, labor costs and amount
    and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense
    competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of
    service. We have also begun competing for business based on
    service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities
    have begun to look for ways to be more sustainable, we are
    ensuring our customers know about our comprehensive services
    that go beyond our core business of picking up and disposing of
    waste.

Employees

At December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    43,400 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,300
    were employed in administrative and sales positions and the
    balance in operations. Approximately 9,900 of our employees are
    covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial
    Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial
    Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally
    require contracting parties to demonstrate financial
    responsibility for their obligations under the contract.
    Financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or
    retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits.
    Various forms of financial assurance also



are required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure,
    post-closure and remedial obligations at many of our landfills.
    In addition, certain of our tax-exempt borrowings require us to
    hold funds in trust for the repayment of our interest and
    principal obligations.

We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of
    credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and
    financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on
    several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual
    requirements, market factors and availability of credit
    capacity. The following table summarizes the various forms and
    dollar amounts (in millions) of financial assurance that we had
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009:

    escrow accounts. The assets held in our funded trust and escrow
    accounts may be drawn and used to meet the obligations for which
    the trusts and escrows were established.

(f)

WMI provides financial guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries
    to municipalities, customers and regulatory authorities. They
    are provided primarily to support our performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure activities.

Our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility becomes current
    in the third quarter of 2010. Accordingly, we will be working to
    renegotiate our existing facility in the near-term. We currently
    expect that the cost of a similar facility will be significantly
    higher than the cost of our existing facility. In an effort to
    manage our financial assurance costs as well as ensure that we
    have access to facilities that meet our ongoing financial
    assurance needs, we are currently evaluating options for
    alternative cost-effective sources of financial assurance.

Virtually no claims have been made against our financial
    assurance instruments in the past, and considering our current
    financial position, management does not expect there to be
    claims against these instruments that will have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Insurance

We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general
    liability, automobile liability, real and personal property,
    workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’
    liability, pollution legal liability and other coverages we
    believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for
    insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident
    deductible under the related insurance policy. As of
    December 31, 2009, our per-incident deductible for our
    general liability program was $2.5 million and our
    per-incident deductible for our workers’ compensation
    insurance program was $5 million. As of December 31,
    2009, our auto liability insurance program included a
    per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to
    additional aggregate deductibles in the $5 million to
    $10 million layer of $4.8 million. We do not expect
    the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or
    other contingency to have a material impact on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated
    insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2009 are
    summarized in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state
    or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and
    transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
    are administered by the U.S. EPA and various other federal,
    state and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use,
    health and safety agencies in the United States and various
    agencies in Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our
    operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations
    and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or
    impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.

Because the major component of our business is the collection
    and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner,
    a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related,
    either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection
    measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial
    and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials
    into the environment. There are costs associated with siting,
    design, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective
    actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and
    post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition,
    development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer
    station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money
    to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There
    cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or
    maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained,
    operating permits are subject to renewal, modification,
    suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with
    these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to
    make significant capital and operating expenditures. However,
    most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of
    business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.



The primary United States federal statutes affecting our
    business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended,
    regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and
    non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop
    programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991,
    the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA,
    which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria
    for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically
    implemented by the states, although states can impose
    requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D
    standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in
    the ordinary course of our operations.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which is also known as
    Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to
    releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the
    environment that have created actual or potential environmental
    hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such
    releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal
    sites upon current and former site owners and operators,
    generators of the hazardous substances at the site and
    transporters who selected the disposal site and transported
    substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on
    the intentional disposal of hazardous substances; it can be
    based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result
    of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of hazardous
    substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable
    statutes and regulations. Liability may include contribution for
    cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action
    or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to
    federal or state regulators in an administrative or
    judicially-approved settlement. Liability could also include
    liability to a PRP that voluntarily expends site

clean-up

costs. Further, liability may include damage to publicly-owned
    natural resources. We are subject to potential liability under
    CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous
    substances have been disposed or as a generator or transporter
    of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, known as the
    Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into
    streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a
    variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal
    sites. If run-off from our operations may be discharged into
    surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and
    obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and,
    under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants
    in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional
    standards for management of storm water runoff that require
    landfills and other waste-handling facilities to obtain storm
    water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other
    facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a
    publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with
    discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before
    the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect
    “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing
    for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act
    provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for
    violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased
    federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air
    pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the
    requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal
    solid waste landfills and large municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities. Standards have also been imposed on manufacturers of
    transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles).
    In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards and
    emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and
    existing large landfills. The regulations impose limits on air
    emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject
    most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain
    operating permitting requirements under Title V of the
    Clean Air Act and, in many instances, require installation of
    landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions
    or to treat and utilize landfill gas on or off-site. In general,
    controlling emissions involves drilling collection wells into a
    landfill and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery
    system or combustion device. We are currently capturing and
    utilizing the renewable energy value of landfill gas at 119 of
    our solid waste landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued
    additional regulations that required affected landfills to
    prepare, by January 2004, startup, shutdown and malfunction
    plans to ensure proper operation of gas collection, control and
    treatment systems.



The EPA has issued new source performance standards and emission
    guidelines for large and small municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities, which include stringent emission limits for various
    pollutants based on Maximum Achievable Control Technology
    standards. These sources are also subject to operating permit
    requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The Clean
    Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards
    applicable to municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities every five years.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended,
    establishes certain employer responsibilities, including
    maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to
    cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards
    promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, and various reporting and record keeping
    obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements.
    Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation
    and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to
    our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along
    with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain
    aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including
    safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies
    with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to
    regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise
    preempted by federal law.

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations
    that affect our operations. Sometimes states’ regulations
    are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not
    otherwise preempted by federal law. Additionally, our collection
    and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and
    regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at
    the source and waste recycling.

Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws
    that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste
    generated outside the state. While laws that overtly
    discriminate against

out-of-state

waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are
    less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court.
    Additionally, certain state and local governments have enacted
    “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require
    that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction
    be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the United States
    Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave
    preference to a local facility that was privately owned was
    unconstitutional, but in 2007 the Court ruled that an ordinance
    directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was
    constitutional. In addition, from time to time, the United
    States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to
    adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation
    allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of
    legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the
    state level could adversely affect our operations. Courts’
    interpretation of flow control legislation or the Supreme Court
    decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous
    waste management services.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted
    “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have
    jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or
    revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s
    or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states,
    provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the
    compliance history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated
    companies, in addition to the applicant or permit holder. These
    laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an
    applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a
    contract to operate, and to deny or revoke a contract or permit
    because of unfitness, unless there is a showing that the
    applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the
    adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in
    place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and
    regulations.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of
    regulations on our current and future operations.

Item
    1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed
    about our business, we may make “forward-looking
    statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to
    future events and anticipated revenues, earnings,



cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating
    results. Forward-looking statements generally include statements
    containing:

•

projections about accounting and finances;

•

plans and objectives for the future;

•

projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our
    performance; or

•

our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or
    future events, circumstances or performance.

You should view these statements with caution. These statements
    are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or
    events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as
    of the date the statements are made. All phases of our business
    are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many
    of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone
    or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us
    and could change whether any forward-looking statement
    ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no
    obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result
    of future events, circumstances or developments. The following
    discussion should be read together with the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are
    some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and
    financial statements for 2010 and beyond.

General
    economic conditions can adversely affect our revenues and our
    operating margins.

Our business is affected by changes in national and general
    economic factors that are outside of our control, including
    consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital
    markets. Although our services are of an essential nature, a
    weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste
    generated, which decreases our revenues. Additionally, consumer
    uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the
    number or amount of services requested by customers and our
    ability to increase customers’ pricing. During weak
    economic conditions we may also be adversely impacted by
    customers’ inability to pay us in a timely manner, if at
    all, due to their financial difficulties, which could include
    bankruptcies. In addition to disruption in the credit markets,
    economic conditions over the last eighteen months negatively
    affected business and consumer spending generally. If our
    customers do not have access to capital, we do not expect that
    our volumes will improve or that we will increase new business.

The
    waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot
    successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial
    condition and operating results may be materially adversely
    affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental,
    quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our
    operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of
    two national waste management companies, regional companies and
    local companies of varying sizes and financial resources. We
    compete with these companies as well as with counties and
    municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and
    disposal operations. These counties and municipalities may have
    financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are
    available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily
    available to them. Also, such governmental units may attempt to
    impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a
    competitive advantage.

In addition, competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales
    volume or to win competitively bid contracts. When this happens,
    we may roll back prices or offer lower pricing to attract or
    retain our customers, resulting in a negative impact to our
    revenue growth from yield on base business.

If we
    do not successfully manage our costs, or do not successfully
    implement our plans and strategies to improve margins, our
    income from operations could be lower than
    expected.

In recent years, we have implemented several profit improvement
    initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our
    revenues.

We have implemented price increases and environmental fees, both
    of which have increased our internal revenue growth and we have
    continued our fuel surcharge program to offset fuel costs. The
    loss of volumes as a result of price increases may negatively
    affect our cash flows or results of operations. We continue to
    seek to divest



underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve
    their profitability. We may not be able to successfully
    negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic
    operations, which could result in asset impairments or the
    continued operation of low-margin businesses. If we are not able
    to fully or successfully implement our plans and strategies for
    any reason, many of which are out of our control, we may not see
    the expected improvements in our income from operations or our
    operating margins.

The
    seasonal nature of our business causes our quarterly results to
    fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative
    of our future results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
    during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
    and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
    trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
    that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
    the hurricanes generally experienced by our Southern Group,
    actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However,
    for several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates earnings at comparatively
    lower margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the
    temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly
    affect the operating results of the affected regions. The
    operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher
    repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower
    winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim
    period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
    an entire year, and operating results for any historical period
    are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future
    period.

We
    cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under
    environmental, health and safety laws, and cannot guarantee that
    they will not be material.

We could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage
    to our properties or to the property of other landowners,
    particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking
    water or soil. Under current law, we could even be held liable
    for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
    the assets or operations involved. Also, we could be liable if
    we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of
    hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or
    if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under
    applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner.
    Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, and
    may in the future, become involved in a variety of legal and
    administrative proceedings relating to land use and
    environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in
    which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to
    impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes
    involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to
    revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and

•

local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental
    agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need,
    allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws
    or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose
    liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons
    involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If
    we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of
    these proceedings could result in, among other things, material
    increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material
    charges for asset impairments.



The
    waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation,
    and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations,
    increase our costs of operations or require us to make
    additional capital expenditures.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
    provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have
    a substantial impact on our business. A large number of complex
    laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental
    protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and
    related matters. Among other things, they may restrict our
    operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

•

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal,
    transfer or processing facilities or expanding existing
    facilities;

•

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal
    prices, rates and volumes;

•

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of

out-of-state

waste or certain categories of waste; or

•

mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste, including
    requirements to recycle rather than landfill certain waste
    streams.

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of
    landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or
    remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills
    temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations
    may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or
    facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could
    be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste
    management facility, we must have various facility permits and
    other governmental approvals, including those relating to
    zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and
    approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to
    obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

The
    adoption of climate change legislation or regulations
    restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could
    increase our costs to operate.

Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the
    United States have been focusing considerable attention on the
    emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse
    gases” and their potential role in climate change. The
    adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of
    greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes,
    could adversely affect our collection and disposal operations.
    Congress is currently working on legislation to control and
    reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States, which
    includes establishing

cap-and-trade

programs. Additionally, the EPA recently announced proposed
    regulations to control emissions of greenhouse gases from
    stationary sources, including municipal solid waste landfills,
    and several states have already begun taking actions to reduce
    future emissions of greenhouse gases. Depending on the form of
    legislation and regulations that are ultimately enacted, our
    operating expenses could increase and some of our operations
    could be less profitable, as we may be required to take any
    number of actions, including the purchase of emission allowances
    or installation of additional pollution control technology.

Significant
    shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will
    increase our operating expenses.

The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable, and can
    fluctuate significantly based on international, political and
    economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our
    control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum
    Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers,
    regional production patterns, weather conditions and
    environmental concerns. We have seen average quarterly fuel
    prices increase by as much as 56% on a

year-over-year

basis and decrease by as much as 47% on a

year-over-year

basis within the last two years. We need fuel to run our
    collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our
    landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially
    increase our operating expenses. Additionally, as fuel prices
    increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our
    vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising
    costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to
    offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to
    pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’
    contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. We
    may



initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising
    costs of fuel, although there can be no assurances that we will
    be able to do so or that such programs will be successful.
    Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, the increased
    operating costs will decrease our operating margins.

We
    have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements,
    and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
    assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could
    negatively impact our liquidity and increase our
    liabilities.

The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for
    environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements.
    We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to
    the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are
    generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels.
    We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental
    damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to
    cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other
    insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size.
    We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling
    us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims.
    The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a
    timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation
    against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks.
    To the extent our insurers were unable to meet their
    obligations, or our own obligations for claims were more than we
    estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our
    financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with
    respect to environmental closure and post-closure obligations,
    we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on
    insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow
    accounts or rely upon WMI financial guarantees. We currently
    have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for
    our operations. We currently do not anticipate any unmanageable
    difficulty in obtaining financial assurance instruments in the
    future, but general economic factors may adversely affect the
    cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes
    in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of
    financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the
    event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters
    of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost,
    or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as
    adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of
    financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to
    deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of
    financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any
    requirements to use cash to support our obligations would
    negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could
    affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.

We may
    record material charges against our earnings due to any number
    of events that could cause impairments to our
    assets.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we
    capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to
    disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions,
    software development costs and other projects. Events that
    could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but
    are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or
    abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion
    permit. If we determine a development or expansion project is
    impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized
    capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility
    or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that
    we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We
    also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment
    annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering
    events.

We may be required to incur charges against earnings if we
    determine that events such as those described cause impairments.
    Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our
    revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity
    prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable
    materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which
    are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The
    majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper
    fibers, including old corrugated cardboard, known as OCC, and
    old newsprint, or ONP. The fluctuations in the market prices or
    demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and
    cash flows, as we experienced in 2008. In the fourth quarter of
    2008, the monthly market prices for OCC and ONP fell by 79%



and 72%, respectively, from their high points within the year.
    Additionally, the decline in market prices for commodities
    resulted in a

year-over-year

decrease in revenue of $447 million in 2009. Our recycling
    operations offer rebates to suppliers. Therefore, even if we
    experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for
    commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase and in some
    circumstances, the rebates may have floors even as market prices
    decrease, which could eliminate any expected profit margins.

There may be significant price fluctuations in the price of
    methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that
    are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery,

waste-to-energy

and independent power production plant operations. The marketing
    and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and

waste-to-energy

operations are generally pursuant to long-term sales agreements.
    Therefore, market volatility does not cause our quarterly
    results to fluctuate significantly. However, as longer-term
    agreements expire and are up for renewal, or as market prices
    remain at lower levels for sustained periods, our revenues will
    be adversely affected. Many of our longer-term agreements
    expired in 2009, and the electricity prices we were able to
    charge without the benefit of long-term agreements were tied to
    market electricity prices, which generally correlate with
    fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets where we
    operate. As a result, we experienced a $76 million decline
    in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 as
    compared with the prior year. Additionally, revenues from our
    independent power production plants can be affected by price
    fluctuations. If we are unable to successfully negotiate
    long-term contracts, or depending on market conditions even with
    long-term contracts, our revenues could be adversely affected.

The
    development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal
    and

waste-to-energy

facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full
    capacity.

Our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill
    and

waste-to-energy

disposal, such as recycling and composting and others are
    working to reduce the waste they generate. In addition, some
    state and local governments mandate recycling and waste
    reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain
    types of waste, such as yard waste, at landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities. Although such mandates are a useful tool to protect
    our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste
    going to landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities in certain areas, which may affect our ability to
    operate our landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities at full capacity, as well as the prices that we can
    charge for landfill disposal and

waste-to-energy

services. Our landfills and our

waste-to-energy

facilities currently provide and have historically provided our
    highest operating margins. We have been expanding our service
    offerings and growing lines of businesses to have the ability to
    service waste streams that do not go to landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to
    reduce waste entirely. However, it is reasonably possible that
    our revenues and our operating margins could be negatively
    affected due to disposal alternatives.

Our
    operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions
    organizing or changes in regulations related to labor
    unions.

Labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees,
    and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain
    groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by
    unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements
    with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union
    representation in the future, and, if successful, the
    negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert
    management attention and result in increased operating expenses
    and lower net income. Additionally, it is possible that attempts
    to amend federal labor laws could be successful and make it
    easier for unions to become recognized as the bargaining
    representative for employees. If we are unable to negotiate
    acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating
    expenses could increase significantly as a result of work
    stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of
    our business and from

time-to-time

are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct
    of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these
    types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible
    outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include



adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require
    substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.

We are
    increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if
    our technology fails, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We may experience problems with either the operation of our
    current information technology systems or the development and
    deployment of new information technology systems that could
    adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion
    of our operations until resolved. We encountered problems with
    the revenue management application that we had been piloting
    throughout 2007, resulting in the termination of the pilot,
    which has impeded our ability to realize improved operating
    margins as a result of a new system. Inabilities and delays in
    implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize
    projected or expected cost savings.

Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to
    timely collect and report financial results in accordance with
    applicable laws and regulations.

We may
    experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations
    as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
    interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting
    rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could
    adversely affect our reported operating results or cause
    unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in
    future periods.

Our
    capital requirements could increase our expenses or cause us to
    change our growth and development plans.

We currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for
    capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, acquisitions
    and other cash expenditures with our cash flows from operations
    and, to the extent necessary and available, additional
    financings. Recent economic conditions have reduced our cash
    flows from operations and could do so in the future. If impacts
    on our cash flows from operations are significant, we may reduce
    or suspend capital expenditures, acquisition activity, dividend
    declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur
    indebtedness to pay for these activities, and there can be no
    assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms
    we deem acceptable. We also may need to incur indebtedness to
    refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the
    cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby
    increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income.

Additionally, we have $3.0 billion of debt as of
    December 31, 2009 that is exposed to changes in market
    interest rates within the next twelve months because of the
    combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds, our interest rate swap
    agreements and borrowings outstanding under our Canadian Credit
    Facility. Therefore, increases in interest rates can increase
    our interest expenses which also would lower our net income.

We may use our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs,
    to the extent available. As of December 31, 2009, we had
    $822 million of capacity under our revolving credit
    facility. In the event of a default under our credit facility,
    we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding
    borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all
    obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to
    do. Additionally, any such default could cause a default under
    many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments.
    Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such
    default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to
    continue to operate.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we
    lease approximately 400,000 square feet under leases
    expiring at various times through 2020. Our Group offices are in
    Pennsylvania, Illinois, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire. We
    also have field-based administrative offices in Arizona,
    Illinois and Texas. We



own or lease real property in most locations where we have
    operations. We have operations in each of the fifty states other
    than Montana. We also have operations in the District of
    Columbia, Puerto Rico and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily
    landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and
    bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and
    equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and
    operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient
    for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to
    make investments in additional equipment and property for
    expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with
    future acquisitions. For more information, see

Under capital allocation programs approved by our Board of
    Directors, we have paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.24 per
    share for a total of $495 million in 2007; $0.27 per share
    for a total of $531 million in 2008; and $0.29 per share
    for a total of $569 million in 2009.

Our Board-approved capital allocation programs have also
    provided for common stock repurchases. The Company did not make
    any common stock repurchases in the first six months of 2009 due
    primarily to the state of the financial markets and the economy.
    In June 2009, we decided that the improvement in the capital
    markets and the economic environment supported a decision to
    repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock during
    the second half of 2009. We repurchased $226 million of our
    common stock during 2009, including $70 million of
    repurchases during the third quarter of 2009 and
    $156 million during the fourth quarter of 2009.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our results of operations
    for the three years ended December 31, 2009. This
    discussion may contain forward-looking statements that
    anticipate results based on management’s plans that are
    subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various
    factors that could cause actual results to differ from
    expectations in Item 1A,

Risk Factors

. The following
    discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and
    together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Overview

In our outlook for 2009, we communicated our belief that we
    would be well positioned to weather the challenges presented by
    the current economic environment. We also noted that we would
    focus our efforts on ensuring we are operating efficiently and
    generating strong and consistent free cash flows. When reviewing
    our 2009 financial results, we believe that our focus throughout
    the year on (i) maintaining our pricing discipline;
    (ii) controlling our costs and reducing discretionary
    spending; and (iii) ensuring that our cost structure is
    flexible enough to respond to volume changes in a timely manner
    has enabled us to produce solid results in a difficult
    environment.

During 2009, our most significant challenges included
    (i) reduced volumes due to an overall decrease in waste
    produced that can be attributed to sharp declines in residential
    and commercial construction and in consumer and business
    spending; (ii) an unusually weak recyclable commodities
    market for most of the year; and (iii) decreases in market
    prices for electricity, which affect the yield of our

waste-to-energy

and landfill

gas-to-energy

operations. Against this backdrop, we believe that our 2009
    results of operations reflected the resilience of our core
    business and the opportunities that economic recovery will
    present for our more efficient organization. The highlights of
    our 2009 financial results include:

•

Revenues of $11.8 billion and internal revenue growth from
    yield from collection and disposal operations of 2.9%;

•

Income from operations of $1.9 billion and income from
    operations as a percentage of revenue of 16.0%, in spite of the
    recognition of $83 million of non-cash impairment charges,
    which were primarily a result of (i) our decision to
    abandon the SAP software as our revenue management system; and
    (ii) a change in expectations for the future operations of
    a landfill in California;

•

Effective tax rate of 28.1% due principally to the favorable
    impacts of fourth quarter adjustments to our provision for
    income taxes related to the carry-back of a capital loss,
    recognition of state net operating losses and tax credits, and
    revaluation of deferred taxes due to Canadian tax rate
    reductions;

•

Diluted earnings per share of $2.01; and

•

Cash flow generated from operating activities of
    $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.2 billion.

In February 2009, we announced that we were consolidating our 45
    Market Areas into 25 Areas to further streamline our operations,
    and throughout 2009 we incurred $50 million of
    restructuring costs related to these efforts. The restructuring
    was a result of our continued efforts to improve the efficiency
    of our operations. In 2009, we exceeded our expected cost
    savings of $120 million on an annualized basis due to the
    restructuring. Although one of our most significant focuses
    throughout 2009 was on controlling costs, there are areas in
    which we have purposefully increased spending, as we believe
    that the long-term benefits we will achieve outweigh their
    negative short-term effect on our costs and margins. These
    include professional fees related to expansion projects,
    acquisitions and the growth of new business lines. We also have
    not cut back on spending for information technology, which we
    believe is imperative to enable our employees to perform
    efficiently.

Liquidity and Cash Flow —

Although the credit
    markets came to an unprecedented standstill in late 2008, in
    February 2009 we were able to issue an aggregate of
    $800 million of senior notes. The proceeds of this debt
    issuance were primarily used to refinance debt maturities, which
    is generally consistent with our practice. The state of the
    credit markets in late 2009 allowed us, in large part because of
    our investment grade credit rating and strong balance sheet, to
    issue an additional $600 million of

30-year

senior notes at an interest rate of 6.125%. We believe that the
    decision to raise capital on such favorable terms was a prudent
    decision, and will increase our flexibility in



pursuing acquisitions and investments in businesses when
    opportunities arise. Even with the increased indebtedness, we
    are well within our debt to capitalization goals and all of our
    financial covenant requirements. However, the increased
    indebtedness is expected to increase our interest expense in
    2010.

As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a
    non-GAAP measure of liquidity. We believe free cash flow gives
    investors insight into our ability to pay our quarterly
    dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other
    investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our
    debt obligations. However, the use of free cash flow as a
    liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes
    certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed
    to, such as declared dividend payments and debt maturities.

We calculate free cash flow as shown in the table below (in
    millions), which may not be the same as similarly-titled
    measures presented by other companies:

The decrease in our free cash flow in 2009 as compared with 2008
    was due, in large part, to the decline in operating cash flows.
    The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities can
    generally be attributed to the economy and market conditions,
    the impacts of which are discussed in detail throughout the
    remainder of

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

. Decreased
    proceeds from divestitures on a

year-over-year

basis also contributed to the decline, due in large part to us
    having fewer underperforming operations to sell.

Our ability to generate over $1.2 billion in free cash flow
    in 2009 enabled us to return $795 million to stockholders
    during the year through the payment of $569 million in cash
    dividends and the repurchase of $226 million of our common
    stock.

Basis
    of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial
    Information

Fair Value Measurements

— In September 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative
    guidance associated with fair value measurements. This guidance
    defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
    In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the
    guidance for all non-financial assets and non-financial
    liabilities, except those that are measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis. Accordingly, we adopted this guidance for
    assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring
    basis effective January 1, 2008 and adopted the guidance
    for non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a
    non-recurring basis effective January 1, 2009. The
    application of the fair value framework did not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Business Combinations

— In December 2007, the
    FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated
    with business combinations. This guidance clarified and revised
    the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This guidance also
    addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired
    in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements
    related to business combinations. Effective January 1,
    2009, we adopted the FASB’s revised guidance associated
    with business combinations. The portions of this guidance that
    relate to business combinations completed before January 1,
    2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. Further, business combinations completed
    in 2009, which are discussed in Note 19 of our Consolidated
    Financial Statements, have not been material to our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. However, to the
    extent that future business combinations are material, our
    adoption of the FASB’s revised authoritative guidance
    associated with business combinations may significantly impact
    our



accounting and reporting for future acquisitions, principally as
    a result of (i) expanded requirements to value acquired
    assets, liabilities and contingencies at their fair values when
    such amounts can be determined and (ii) the requirement
    that acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be
    expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the
    cost of the acquisition.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements

— In December 2007, the FASB issued
    authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for
    the de-consolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance also
    established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
    ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be
    reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. We
    adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The presentation
    and disclosure requirements of this guidance, which must be
    applied retrospectively for all periods presented, have resulted
    in reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial
    information and the remeasurement of our 2008 and 2007 effective
    tax rates, which are discussed in Note 9 of our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information related to the impact of the
    implementation of new accounting pronouncements on our results
    of operations and financial position.

Reclassification of Segment Information

—
    During the first quarter of 2009, we transferred responsibility
    for the oversight of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our
    four geographic Groups. We believe that, by integrating the
    management of our recycling facilities’ operations with the
    remainder of our solid waste business, we can more efficiently
    provide comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers
    and ensure that we are focusing on maximizing the profitability
    and return on invested capital of our business on an integrated
    basis. As a result of this operational change, we also changed
    the way we review the financial results of our geographic
    Groups. Beginning in 2009, the financial results of our material
    recovery facilities and secondary processing facilities are
    included as a component of their respective geographic Group and
    the financial results of our recycling brokerage business and
    electronics recycling services are included as part of our
    “Other” operations. We have reflected the impact of
    these changes for all periods presented to provide financial
    information that consistently reflects our current approach to
    managing our geographic Group operations. Refer to Note 21
    of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
    about our reportable segments.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity,
    revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and
    assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent
    on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of
    precision from data available or simply cannot be readily
    calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases,
    these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we
    must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial
    statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates
    and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of
    uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
    environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and
    self-insurance reserves and recoveries. Actual results could
    differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use
    in the preparation of our financial statements.

Landfills

Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and
    assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and
    develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value
    of capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement
    obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and
    timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each
    landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and
    (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event.

Landfill Costs

— We estimate the total cost to
    develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as
    landfill liner material and installation, excavation for
    airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest,

on-site

road
    construction and



other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill
    development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint
    and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these
    landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The
    remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to
    develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity
    and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of
    accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future
    purchase and development costs.

Final Capping Costs

— We estimate the cost for
    each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped
    and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates
    also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor
    in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel
    allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping
    events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping
    event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each
    event are amortized over the related capacity associated with
    the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review
    these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change.
    Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction,
    for final capping events immediately impact the required
    liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in
    estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to
    the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When
    the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has
    not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is
    recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill
    airspace amortization.

Closure and Post-Closure Costs

— We base our
    estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our
    interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for
    closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The
    estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also
    consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in
    inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal
    and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of
    these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less
    certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure
    events immediately impact the required liability and the
    corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a
    fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be
    amortized immediately through expense. When the change in
    estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully
    consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income
    prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

Expansion Airspace

— We include currently
    unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances.
    First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort,
    we must generally expect the initial expansion permit
    application to be submitted within one year, and the final
    expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we
    must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is
    likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-



based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify
    potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the
    unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that
    airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace even if these criteria are no longer met,
    based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In
    these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved
    through a landfill-specific review process that includes
    approval of our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the
    Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
    Of the 39 landfill sites with expansions at
    December 31, 2009, 14 landfills required the Chief
    Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted
    airspace. Nine of these landfills required approval by our Chief
    Financial Officer because of community or political opposition
    that could impede the expansion process. The remaining five
    landfills required approval primarily due to the permit
    application processes not meeting the one- or five-year
    requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and
    post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the
    landfill.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or
    AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the
    measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is
    then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of
    settlement that is forecasted will take into account several
    site-specific factors including current and projected mix of
    waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated
    number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste,
    anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or
    recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In
    addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a
    subsequent multi- level review by our engineering group, and the
    AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as
    necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that
    the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the
    life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill
    approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and
    deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the
    corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization
    rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final
    capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure
    activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be
    capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if
    the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined
    that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in
    calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be
    required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly
    higher amortization expense. If it is determined that the
    likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote,
    the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are
    expensed immediately.

Environmental
    Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
    that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities
    include potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations,
    settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as
    costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up,
    such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental
    internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for
    expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations
    when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.
    We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation
    and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on
    a number of estimates and assumptions.



Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we
    estimate costs required to remediate sites based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.

Asset
    Impairments

Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill
    expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on
    their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We
    review the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In
    order to assess whether a potential impairment exists, the
    assets’ carrying values are compared with their
    undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating future cash
    flows requires significant judgment about factors such as
    general economic conditions and projected growth rates, and our
    estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized.
    Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value of the
    asset to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined
    by considering (i) internally developed discounted
    projected cash flow analysis of the asset; (ii) actual
    third-party valuations;

and/or

(iii) information available regarding the current market
    environment for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset is
    determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
    impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the
    period that the events or changes in circumstances that
    indicated the carrying value of the assets may not be
    recoverable occurred. These events or changes in circumstances
    are referred to as impairment indicators.

There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and
    goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its
    carrying value, including goodwill. We use a combination of two
    valuation methods, a market approach and an income approach, to
    estimate the fair value of our operating segments. Fair value
    computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of
    factors, including projected future operating results, economic
    projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable
    marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in
    applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these
    two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair
    value of our operating segments.

The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the
    aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar
    characteristics of our business as a multiple of their reported
    cash flows. We then apply that multiple to our operating
    segment’s cash flows to estimate their fair value. We
    believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a
    fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with
    operations and economic characteristics comparable to our
    operating segments.



The income approach is based on the long-term projected future
    cash flows of our operating segments. We discount the estimated
    cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of
    capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash
    flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe
    that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair
    value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected
    long-term performance considering the economic and market
    conditions that generally affect our business.

Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim
    basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that
    would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of
    goodwill has been impaired.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves and Recoveries

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities
    associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated
    expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally
    is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by
    factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our
    estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly
    different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the
    frequency or severity of future incidents differ significantly
    from our assumptions. Estimated insurance recoveries related to
    recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that
    the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Operating
    Revenues

Our operating revenues in 2009 were $11.8 billion, compared
    with $13.4 billion in 2008 and $13.3 billion in 2007.
    We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western Groups, and our Wheelabrator
    Group, which includes our

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants, or IPPs.
    These five Groups are our reportable segments. Shown below (in

Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
    collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and

waste-to-energy

services and from sales of commodities by our recycling and

waste-to-energy

operations. Revenues from our collection operations are
    influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of
    collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the
    waste collected, distance to the MRF or disposal facility and
    our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations
    consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type
    and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal
    facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally
    based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into
    account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the
    solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally
    consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities
    to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection,
    disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel
    surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for fuel.
    Our

waste-to-energy

revenues, which are generated by our Wheelabrator Group, are
    based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs and amounts charged for the sale of energy
    and steam. Our “Other” revenues include our in-plant
    services, landfill

gas-to-energy

operations,
    Port-O-Let

®

services, street and parking lot sweeping services, portable
    self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and healthcare
    solutions services.

Average revenue growth from yield from “Collection and
    disposal” excludes all electricity-related revenues
    generated by our Wheelabrator Group, which are reported as
    “Electricity” revenues. Before 2009, we reported
    electricity-related revenues from Wheelabrator’s IPPs as
    “Electricity” and electricity-related revenues from
    Wheelabrator’s

waste-to-energy

facilities in

“Waste-to-energy.”

Beginning in 2009, all of Wheelabrator’s
    electricity-related revenues are included in
    “Electricity” and only the disposal revenues are
    included in

“Waste-to-energy

disposal.” We have reflected the impact of this change for
    all years presented to provide information that consistently
    reflects our current approach.

Our revenues decreased $1,597 million, or 11.9%, in 2009 as
    compared with 2008. A substantial portion of these declines can
    be attributed to market factors, including (i) recyclable
    commodity prices; (ii) lower fuel prices, which reduced
    revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program; (iii) the
    effect of lower electricity prices on our

waste-to-energy

business; and (iv) foreign currency translation on revenues
    from our Canadian operations.

In addition, revenues continue to decline due to lower volumes,
    which have resulted from the slowdown in the economy. In 2009,
    economic pressures continued to significantly reduce consumer
    and business spending, which meant less waste was being
    generated. However, our revenue growth from average yield on our
    collection and disposal operations was $323 million in 2009
    which demonstrates our commitment to pricing even in the current
    economic environment.

Towards the end of 2009, we began to see the trend of volume
    decline moderate. For the fourth quarter of 2009, our revenue
    decline was $102 million, or 3.3% as compared with the
    fourth quarter of 2008. This improvement, as



compared with our full-year revenue decline of 11.9%, is
    primarily driven by the steady commodity price recovery trend
    that occurred throughout 2009 as compared with the severe
    decline in commodity pricing and demand in the fourth quarter of
    2008. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to
    see our

year-over-year

volume comparisons improve in our collection and disposal
    businesses.

The following provides further details associated with our

period-to-period

change in revenues.

Average
    yield

Collection and disposal average yield

— This
    measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing
    activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and

waste-to-energy

disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth
    from collection and disposal average yield includes not only
    base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases,
    but also (i) certain average price changes related to the
    overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of
    services provided and the geographic locations where our
    services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from
    new and lost business; and (iii) price decreases to retain
    customers.

In both 2009 and 2008, the increases in revenues from yield were
    driven by our collection operations, which experienced
    substantial yield growth in all lines of business and in every
    geographic operating group, primarily as a result of our
    continued focus on pricing initiatives, including various fee
    increases. As discussed below, increased collection revenues due
    to pricing have been more than offset by revenue declines from
    lower collection volumes. However, increased revenue growth from
    yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs
    has consistently provided margin improvements in our collection
    line of business. In addition to the revenue growth from yield
    in the collection line of business, we experienced increases in
    revenues from yield at our landfills and our transfer stations
    due to our continued focus on pricing activities.

Revenues from our environmental fee, which are included in
    average yield on collection and disposal, increased by
    $37 million and $60 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Environmental fee
    revenues totaled $218 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared with $181 million in 2008
    and $121 million in 2007.

Recycling commodities

— For the first nine
    months of 2008, record high commodity prices favorably impacted
    our revenue growth. Then, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we
    saw a rapid decline in commodity prices due to a significant
    decrease in the demand for commodities both domestically and
    internationally. Commodity demand and prices continued to be
    weak in the first nine months of 2009 as compared with
    record-high commodity prices experienced through September of
    2008. However, market prices for recyclable commodities are
    recovering and prices have increased significantly from the
    record lows experienced in late 2008 and early 2009. While
    commodity prices are still significantly less than the levels
    seen in 2007 and the first nine months of 2008, the current
    price recovery trend contributed to revenue growth in the fourth
    quarter of 2009 and is expected to contribute to revenue growth
    in the coming year.

Electricity

— The changes in revenue from yield
    provided by our

waste-to-energy

business are largely due to fluctuations in rates charged for
    electricity under our power purchase contracts that generally
    correlate with natural gas prices in the markets where we
    operate. In 2009, we experienced a decline of $76 million
    in revenue from yield at our

waste-to-energy

facilities due to the falling electricity prices. During 2009,
    approximately 34% of the electricity revenue at our

waste-to-energy

facilities was subject to current market rates, which is an
    increase from 18% during 2008. Our

waste-to-energy

facilities’ exposure to market price volatility is
    increasing as more long-term contracts expire.

In 2008, we saw an increase of $24 million in revenue from
    yield provided by our

waste-to-energy

business. This increase was largely due to annual rate increases
    for electricity under long-term contracts and favorable energy
    market pricing.

Fuel surcharges and mandated fees —

Revenue
    generated by our fuel surcharge program decreased by
    $328 million and increased by $189 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    fluctuation is directly attributable to the fluctuation in the
    crude oil index prices we use for our fuel surcharge program.



The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily
    related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by
    various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our
    landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not
    had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for
    the periods included in the table above.

Volume

— Our collection business accounted for
    $622 million of the total volume decrease in 2009. Our
    industrial collection operations experienced the most
    significant revenue declines due to lower volumes primarily as a
    result of the continued slowdown in both residential and
    commercial construction activities across the United States. Our
    commercial and residential collection lines of business tend to
    be more recession resistant than our other lines of business.
    However, we still experienced some commercial and residential
    collection volume declines in 2009 that we attribute to the
    recessionary economic environment, as well as to pricing and
    competition.

In 2009, we also experienced a 16% decline in third-party
    revenue due to volume at our landfills. This decrease was most
    significant in our more economically sensitive special waste and
    construction and demolition waste streams, although municipal
    solid waste streams at our landfills have also decreased. Lower
    third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also
    caused revenue declines and can generally be attributed to
    economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition.
    Lower volumes in our recycling operations caused declines in
    revenues of $74 million in 2009. These decreases are
    attributable to the drastic decline in the domestic and
    international demand for recyclables in late 2008. Demand for
    recyclable commodities has recovered throughout 2009, although
    it has yet to compare favorably to the levels we experienced in
    advance of the market shift in the fourth quarter of 2008.

In 2008, revenue declines due to lower volumes were driven by
    lower collection volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower transfer
    station and third-party disposal volumes. Declines in revenues
    from volumes in these lines of business were most significantly
    affected by (i) our focus on improving margins through
    increased pricing; and (ii) economic conditions, which
    particularly affected our industrial collection line of
    business. Revenue declines attributable to lower volumes also
    affected our recycling operations due to the rapid decline in
    demand for recyclable commodities experienced during the fourth
    quarter of 2008

Acquisitions and divestitures

— Revenues
    increased $97 million and $117 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to
    acquisitions, principally in the collection, transfer and
    recycling businesses, although we also made acquisitions
    starting in 2008 in our “Other” business as we focused
    on entering new, complementary lines of business. Divestitures
    accounted for decreased revenues of $37 million and
    $130 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. These divestitures were primarily comprised
    of collection operations and, to a lesser extent, transfer
    station and recycling operations. Beginning in the second
    quarter of 2008, revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded
    revenue declines from divestitures, a trend we had not seen in
    over two years. This change reflects our shift in focus from
    divesting underperforming operations to acquiring businesses.

Operating
    Expenses

Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related
    benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and
    repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages,
    bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and
    the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and
    disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party
    disposal facilities and transfer stations;
    (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment,
    vehicles and facilities and related labor costs;
    (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of
    independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to
    disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as
    volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold,
    which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated
    with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which
    represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet
    and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and
    franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes,
    municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties;
    (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest
    accretion on asset retirement and environmental remediation
    obligations, leachate and methane collection and treatment,
    landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs;
    (ix) risk management costs, which include workers’
    compensation and insurance and claim costs; and (x) other
    operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and
    facility rent and property taxes.



Our operating expenses decreased by $1,225 million, or
    14.5% when comparing 2009 with 2008 and increased
    $64 million, or 0.8% when comparing 2008 with 2007.
    Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 61.4% in
    2009, 63.2% in 2008 and 63.1% in 2007. The changes in our
    operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008 can largely be attributed to the following:

Volume declines and divestitures —

Throughout
    2009 and 2008, we experienced volume declines as a result of
    (i) the economy; (ii) pricing and competition; and
    (iii) divestitures. We continue to manage our fixed costs
    and reduce our variable costs as we experience volume declines,
    and have achieved significant cost savings as a result. These
    cost decreases have benefited each of the operating cost
    categories identified in the table below.

Changes in market prices for recyclable
    commodities

— Market prices for recyclable
    commodities declined sharply when comparing 2009 with 2008. This
    significant decrease in market prices was the driver of the
    decrease in cost of goods sold during 2009. Market prices for
    recyclable commodities climbed robustly through most of 2008,
    achieving levels during the first nine months of 2008 that had
    not been seen in several years. However, during the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the market prices and demand for recyclable
    commodities declined sharply. The resulting near-historic low
    prices and reduced demand carried into the first quarter of 2009
    and, although prices have steadily increased during 2009, they
    remained significantly below prior-year levels throughout most
    of 2009.

Fuel price changes

— Lower market prices for
    fuel caused decreases in both our direct fuel costs and our
    subcontractor costs for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    On average, diesel fuel prices decreased 35%, from $3.81 per
    gallon for 2008 to $2.46 per gallon for 2009. Diesel fuel prices
    varied significantly in 2008, reaching a record-high price of
    $4.76 per gallon in July and falling to a three-year low of
    $2.33 per gallon by the end of the year. On average, diesel fuel
    prices increased 32% in 2008 from $2.88 per gallon in 2007 to
    $3.81 per gallon.

Changes in risk-free interest rates

— We
    recognized $35 million in favorable adjustments during 2009
    compared with $33 million in unfavorable adjustments during
    2008 and $8 million in unfavorable adjustments during 2007
    due to changes in United States Treasury rates, which are used
    to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation
    obligations and recovery assets. Over the course of 2009, the
    discount rate we use increased from 2.25% to 3.75%. During 2008,
    the discount rate we use declined from 4.00% to 2.25%. During
    2007, the discount rate we use declined from 4.75% to 4.00%.
    These adjustments have been reflected in the landfill operating
    costs category in the table below.

Canadian exchange rates

— When comparing the
    average exchange rate for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the Canadian exchange rate weakened by 7%, which
    decreased our expenses in all operating cost categories. The
    weakening of the Canadian dollar decreased our total operating
    expenses by $40 million for 2009 as compared with 2008.
    Changes in currency exchange rates had very little impact when
    comparing the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Acquisitions and growth initiatives

— In both
    2009 and 2008, we have experienced cost increases attributable
    to recently acquired businesses and, to a lesser extent, our
    various growth and business development initiatives. These cost
    increases have affected each of the operating cost categories
    identified in the table below.



The following table summarizes the major components of our
    operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency
    translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in
    millions):

The

period-to-period

changes for each category of operating expenses are discussed
    below.

Labor and
    related benefits —

•

When comparing 2009 with 2008, the cost declines were generally
    a result of (i) headcount and overtime reductions related
    to volume declines; (ii) effects of foreign currency
    translation; (iii) a benefit from the restructuring we
    initiated in January of 2009, although most of these savings are
    reflected in our selling, general and administrative expenses;
    and (iv) cost savings provided by our operational
    improvement initiatives. These cost savings have been offset, in
    part, by higher hourly wages due to merit increases; and
    (ii) increased accrued bonus expense as our performance
    against targets established by our annual incentive plans was
    stronger than it had been in 2008.

•

When comparing 2008 with 2007, wages increased due to annual
    merit adjustments, although these higher costs were more than
    offset by headcount reductions due to operational efficiencies
    and divestitures. We experienced additional overtime and other
    labor costs due to severe winter weather conditions during the
    first quarter of 2008 in our Midwest Group. Our accrued bonus
    expenses were lower in 2008 because our performance against
    targets established by our incentive plans was not as strong as
    it had been in 2007.

•

The comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for
    the periods presented has also been affected by costs incurred
    for the resolution of labor disputes with certain collective
    bargaining units. Such costs increased our 2009 expense by
    $9 million and our 2008 expense by $42 million. The
    costs incurred during 2009 and 2008 were primarily associated
    with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from underfunded
    multi-employer pension plans.

Transfer and disposal costs —

During 2009 and
    2008, these cost decreases were a result of volume declines and
    our continued focus on reducing disposal costs associated with
    our third-party disposal volumes by improving internalization.
    The 2009 decrease was also partially due to foreign currency
    translation.

Maintenance and repairs —

During 2009, these
    costs declined as a result of volume declines and various fleet
    initiatives that have favorably affected our maintenance, parts
    and supplies costs. These decreases have been offset partially
    by cost increases due to differences in the timing and scope of
    planned maintenance projects at our

waste-to-energy

and landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities.

Subcontractor costs —

During 2009, these cost
    decreases are a result of volume declines, a significant
    decrease in diesel fuel prices and the effects of foreign
    currency translation.

Cost of goods sold —

The 2009 and 2008 cost
    changes are principally due to changes in the recycling
    commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result of changes
    in market prices for recyclable commodities discussed above and
    volume declines.



Fuel —

The cost changes for 2009 and 2008 are a
    result of changes in market prices for diesel fuel discussed
    above and volume declines.

Disposal and franchise fees and taxes —

These
    cost decreases are principally a result of volume declines,
    although the comparability of the periods presented is also
    affected by the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in
    our Eastern Group, which reduced these expenses by
    $18 million during 2007 and $3 million during 2008.

Landfill operating costs —

The changes in this
    category for the years presented was primarily driven by the
    changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the present
    value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery
    assets. The impacts of these rate changes are discussed above.

Risk management —

Our consistent risk
    management costs reflect the success we have had over the last
    several years in managing these costs, which can be primarily
    attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident
    and injury rates. For 2008, the decrease in expense was largely
    associated with reduced actuarial projections of workers’
    compensation costs and reduced auto and general liability claims
    for current claim periods.

Other —

The comparison of these costs has been
    significantly affected by the following:

•

In 2009, we had a significant increase in the property taxes
    assessed for one of our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

•

In 2008 and 2007, we had relatively higher gains recognized on
    the sales of assets due to our focus on identifying and selling
    under-utilized assets in order to increase our efficiency.

•

In 2007, our Western Group incurred “Other” operating
    expenses of $33 million for security, labor, lodging,
    travel and other costs incurred as a result of labor disruptions
    in Oakland and Los Angeles, California.

•

In 2007, we incurred $21 million of lease termination costs
    associated with the purchase of one of our independent power
    production plants that had previously been operated through a
    lease agreement.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
    (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related
    insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and
    equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which
    include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services;
    (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances
    for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and
    (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which
    include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and
    data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment,
    rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial
    impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our
    “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.

Significant changes in our selling, general, and administrative
    expenses during the reported periods are as summarized below:

Labor and related benefits

— In 2009, our labor
    and related benefits costs have declined because we have been
    realizing benefits associated with our January 2009
    restructuring The comparability of our labor and related
    benefits expenses in 2009 has also been affected by a
    significant decrease in non-cash compensation costs associated
    with the equity-based compensation provided for by our long-term
    incentive plans as a result of (i) a decline in the
    grant-date fair value of our equity awards; (ii) lower
    performance against established targets for certain awards than
    in the



prior year; and (iii) the reversal of all compensation
    costs previously recognized for our 2008 performance share units
    based on a determination that it is no longer probable that the
    targets established for that award will be met. This decrease in
    non-cash compensation costs was offset, in part, by higher costs
    associated with our salary deferral plan, the costs of which are
    directly affected by equity-market conditions. Additionally,
    contract labor costs incurred for various Corporate support
    functions were lower during 2009 than in 2008.

The 2008 increase in labor and related benefits costs was
    primarily attributable to (i) higher salaries and hourly
    wages due to merit increases; (ii) higher compensation
    costs due to an increase in headcount driven by an increase in
    the size of our sales force and our focus on our people and
    business development initiatives; and (iii) higher non-cash
    compensation costs associated with the equity-based compensation
    provided for by our long-term incentive plans. Additionally, we
    also experienced higher insurance and benefit costs. These
    increases were offset partially by lower bonus expenses accrued
    in 2008 because our performance against targets established by
    our incentive plan was not as strong as it had been in 2007.

Professional fees

— In 2009, we experienced a
    slight decrease in professional fees due primarily to lower
    consulting fees related to our various strategic initiatives as
    compared with 2008. This decrease was largely offset by higher
    legal fees and expenses in 2009.

In 2008, our professional fees increased

year-over-year

due to legal and consulting costs we incurred related to
    (i) the support of a proposed acquisition in 2008; and
    (ii) our business development initiatives. These increases
    were partially offset by lower consulting costs in 2008 related
    to various strategic initiatives during 2007, including the
    support and development of the SAP waste and recycling revenue
    management system, which we discontinued development of in early
    2008.

Provision for bad debts

— The $3 million
    decline in our provision for bad debts in 2009 can be generally
    attributed to (i) the decrease in our revenues and accounts
    receivable due to current economic conditions and market
    factors; and (ii) our continued focus on the management and
    collection of our receivables. However, in 2008, our provision
    for bad debts increased $8 million as the effects of the
    weakened economy increased collection risks associated with
    certain customers.

Other

— During 2009, our costs associated with
    advertising, meetings, seminars, and travel and entertainment
    declined as a result of our increased efforts to reduce
    controllable spending. These lower costs were due in part to the
    recent restructuring. This decline was offset partially by
    higher legal expenses. In 2008, we were focusing on our sales,
    marketing and other initiatives and identifying new customers,
    which resulted in increases in our advertising costs and travel
    and entertainment.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of
    property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital
    leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years;
    (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those
    incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill
    development, construction and asset retirement costs arising
    from closure and post-closure, on a

units-of-consumption

method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated
    remaining permitted and expansion capacity of a site;
    (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs
    arising from final capping obligations on a

units-of-consumption

method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity
    associated with each final capping event; and
    (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite
    life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a
    straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related
    agreements, which are generally from two to ten years depending
    on the type of asset.



The following table summarizes the components of our
    depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December
    31 (dollars in millions):

In both 2009 and 2008, the decrease in depreciation of tangible
    property and equipment is largely due to (i) components of
    enterprise-wide software becoming fully-depreciated; and
    (ii) our focus on retiring or selling under-utilized assets.

The decrease in amortization of landfill airspace expense in
    2009 and 2008 is largely due to volume declines as a result of
    (i) the slowdown in the economy; (ii) our pricing
    program and competition, both of which have significantly
    reduced our collection volumes; and (iii) the re-direction
    of waste to third-party disposal facilities in certain regions
    due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current
    capacity constraints of landfills where we are working on
    procuring an expansion permit. The comparability of our
    amortization of landfill airspace for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 has also been affected by
    adjustments recorded in each year for changes in estimates
    related to our final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, landfill amortization expense was reduced by
    $14 million, $3 million and $17 million,
    respectively, for the effects of these changes in estimates. In
    each year, the majority of the reduced expense resulting from
    the revised estimates was associated with final capping changes
    that were generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to
    improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume
    declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for
    final capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of
    final capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill
    expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping
    costs.

Restructuring

In January 2009, we took steps to further streamline our
    organization by (i) consolidating our Market Areas;
    (ii) integrating the management of our recycling operations
    with our other solid waste business; and (iii) realigning
    our Corporate organization with this new structure in order to
    provide support functions more efficiently.

Our principal operations are managed through our Groups. Each of
    our four geographic Groups had been further divided into 45
    Market Areas. As a result of our restructuring, the Market Areas
    were consolidated into 25 Areas. We found that our larger Market
    Areas generally were able to achieve efficiencies through
    economies of scale that were not present in our smaller Market
    Areas, and this reorganization has allowed us to lower costs and
    to continue to standardize processes and improve productivity.
    In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, responsibility
    for the oversight of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities was transferred from our Waste
    Management Recycle America, or WMRA, organization to our four
    geographic Groups. By integrating the management of our
    recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste
    business, we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive
    environmental solutions to our customers. In addition, as a
    result of this realignment, we have significantly reduced the
    overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our
    business and have increased the geographic Groups’ focus on
    maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of
    our business on an integrated basis.

This restructuring eliminated over 1,500 employee positions
    throughout the Company. During 2009, we recognized
    $50 million of pre-tax charges associated with this
    restructuring, of which $41 million were related to
    employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were
    primarily related to lease obligations that we will continue to
    incur over the remaining lease term for certain operating lease
    agreements.



(Income)
    Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual
    Items

The following table summarizes the major components of
    “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and

(Income) expense from divestitures (including

held-for-sale

impairments)

— The net gains from divestitures
    during 2008 and 2007 were a result of our focus on selling
    underperforming businesses. In 2008, these gains were primarily
    related to the divestiture of underperforming collection
    operations in our Southern Group; and in 2007, the gains were
    related to the divestiture of underperforming collection,
    transfer and recycling operations in our Eastern, Western and
    Southern Groups.

Asset impairments (excluding

held-for-sale

impairments)

— Through December 31, 2008, we
    had capitalized $70 million of accumulated costs associated
    with the development of our waste and recycling revenue
    management system. A significant portion of these costs was
    specifically associated with the purchase of the license of
    SAP’s waste and recycling revenue management software and
    the efforts required to develop and configure that software for
    our use. After a failed pilot implementation of the software in
    one of our smallest Market Areas, the development efforts
    associated with the SAP revenue management system were suspended
    in 2007. As disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, in March 2008, we filed suit against SAP
    and are currently scheduled for trial in May 2010.

During 2009, we determined to enhance and improve our existing
    revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated
    with the development and implementation of a revenue management
    system that would include the licensed SAP software.
    Accordingly, after careful consideration of the failures of the
    SAP software, we determined to abandon any alternative that
    would include the use of the SAP software. The determination to
    abandon the SAP software as our revenue management system
    resulted in a non-cash charge of $51 million,
    $49 million of which was recognized during the first
    quarter of 2009 and $2 million of which was recognized
    during the fourth quarter of 2009.

We recognized an additional $32 million of impairment
    charges during 2009, $27 million of which was recognized by
    the West Group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair
    a landfill in California as a result of a change in our
    expectations for the future operations of the landfill. The
    remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a
    charge required to write down our investments in certain
    portable self-storage operations to their fair value as a result
    of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those
    operations.

During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge,
    primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our
    Southern Group. During 2007, we recognized $12 million in
    impairment charges related to two landfills in our Southern
    Group. The impairments were necessary as a result of the
    re-evaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and
    the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be
    renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for
    the second landfill.

Reportable segments

— The most significant
    items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic
    Groups during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009
    are summarized below:

•

During 2009 and 2008, each Group experienced declines in
    revenues due to lower volumes, resulting in decreased income
    from operations. The volume declines were generally the result
    of the significant downturn in the overall economic environment,
    particularly in our industrial collection line of business,
    which has been affected by the sharp decline in residential and
    commercial construction across the United States.

•

Significantly lower recycling commodity prices in 2009 as
    compared with 2008 had an unfavorable effect on each of the four
    geographic Group’s results. During the fourth quarter of
    2008, commodity prices dropped sharply from the prices we
    experienced throughout 2007 and the first nine months of 2008.
    This decline was a result of a significant decrease in the
    demand for commodities both domestically and internationally.
    The resulting near-historic low prices and reduced demand
    carried into 2009 and, although prices have steadily recovered,
    they remained significantly below the levels of the prior two
    years. When comparing 2008 to 2007, the significant decline in
    commodity prices that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008
    resulted in operating losses that more than offset the increases
    in operating income generated during the first nine months of
    2008.

•

During 2009, we recorded $50 million of charges associated
    with our January 2009 restructuring. During 2008 and 2007, we
    recorded restructuring charges of $2 million and
    $10 million, respectively. Refer to Note 12 of our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the
    impact of these charges on each of our reportable segments.

The negative impact of these factors has been partially offset
    by the favorable effects of (i) increased revenue growth
    from yield on our collection and disposal business as a result
    of our pricing strategies, particularly in our collection
    operations; and (ii) cost savings attributed to our January
    2009 restructuring, our continued focus on controlling costs
    through operating efficiencies, and our increased focus on
    reducing controllable selling, general and administrative
    expenses, particularly for travel and entertainment during 2009.

Other significant items affecting the comparability of each
    Groups’ results of operations for years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below:

Eastern

— During 2009, the Group recognized
    (i) an $18 million increase in revenues and income
    from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of
    our landfills; and (ii) a $9 million charge related to
    bargaining unit employees in New Jersey agreeing to our proposal
    to withdraw them from an underfunded, multi-employer pension
    fund. During 2008, the Group’s operating income was
    negatively affected by a



$14 million charge related to the withdrawal of certain
    collective bargaining units from underfunded multi-employer
    pension plans. The Group’s operating income for 2007 was
    favorably affected by (i) net divestiture gains of
    $33 million; and (ii) an $18 million decrease in
    disposal fees and taxes due to the favorable resolution of a
    disposal tax matter.

Midwest

— During 2009, the Group’s
    operating results were favorably affected by a $10 million
    reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of
    changes in certain estimates related to final capping, closure
    and post-closure obligations. The Group’s 2008 operating
    results were negatively affected by $44 million of
    additional operating expenses primarily incurred as a result of
    a labor dispute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Included in the labor
    dispute expenses are $32 million in charges related to the
    withdrawal of certain of the Group’s bargaining units from
    underfunded multi-employer pension plans. In addition, the Group
    experienced unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter
    of 2008.

Additionally, when comparing the average exchange rate for 2009
    with 2008, the Canadian exchange rate weakened by 7%, which
    decreased the Group’s income from operations. The effects
    of foreign currency translation were the most significant to
    this Group because substantially all of our Canadian operations
    are managed by our Midwest organization. Changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the
    comparison of 2008 with 2007.

Southern

— During 2008, the Group’s
    operating income was favorably affected by $29 million of
    divestiture gains, offset, in part, by a $3 million
    landfill impairment charge. During 2007, the Group recorded
    $12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of
    its landfills. These charges were largely offset by gains on
    divestitures of $11 million.

Western

— The Group’s 2009 income from
    operations includes the recognition of an impairment charge of
    $27 million as a result of a change in expectations for the
    future operations of a landfill in California, which was offset,
    in part, by the recognition of a $6 million gain associated
    with the sale of water rights at a landfill. During 2008, the
    Group recognized a $6 million gain primarily related to the
    sale of surplus real estate. In 2007, labor disputes negatively
    affected the Group’s operating results by $37 million,
    principally as a result of “Operating” expenses
    incurred for security, deployment and lodging costs for
    replacement workers. Gains on divestitures of operations were
    $16 million for 2007.

Wheelabrator

— The comparability of the
    Group’s 2009 income from operations with the prior years
    has been significantly affected by (i) a decline in market
    prices for electricity, which had a more significant impact on
    the Group’s results in 2009 due to the expiration of
    several long-term energy contracts and short-term pricing
    arrangements; (ii) an increase in costs for international
    and domestic business development activities; and (iii) an
    increase in “Operating” expenses of $11 million
    as a result of a significant increase in the property taxes
    assessed for one of our

waste-to-energy

facilities. Exposure to current electricity market prices
    increased from 18% of total electricity production in 2008 to
    34% in 2009. The Group’s exposure to current electricity
    market price volatility is expected to continue to grow to about
    50% by the end of 2010 as several long-term contracts are set to
    expire next year. The Group’s 2008 operating results were
    favorably affected by increases in market rates for energy
    during the second half of 2008, while the Group’s 2007
    operating results were unfavorably affected by a
    $21 million charge for the early termination of a lease
    agreement. The early termination was due to the Group’s
    purchase of an independent power production plant that it had
    previously operated through a lease agreement.

Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining
    components of our results of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below:

Other

— The unfavorable change in 2009
    operating results compared with 2008 is largely due to
    (i) the effect that the previously discussed lower
    recycling commodity prices had on our recycling brokerage
    activities; (ii) an increase in costs being incurred to
    support the identification and development of new lines of
    business that will complement our core business; (iii) the
    unfavorable impact lower energy prices during 2009 had on our
    landfill-gas-to-energy operations; and (iv) certain
    year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our
    reportable segments that were not included in the measure of
    segment income from operations used to assess their performance
    for the periods disclosed.



The unfavorable change in operating results in 2008 when
    compared with 2007 is the result of (i) the unfavorable
    effect that the previously discussed fourth quarter of 2008
    sharp drop in recycling commodity prices had on our recycling
    brokerage activities; and (ii) costs being incurred to
    support our increased focus on the identification and
    development of new lines of business that will complement our
    core business.

Corporate and Other

— Significant items
    affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods
    presented include:

•

the recognition of $34 million of favorable adjustments
    during 2009 by our closed sites management group due to
    increases in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the
    present value of our environmental remediation obligations and
    environmental remediation recovery assets, while in 2008 and
    2007, the same group recognized charges to landfill operating
    costs of $32 million and $8 million, respectively, due
    to declines in U.S. Treasury rates during those periods;

•

a significant decline in “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses in 2009 resulting from workforce
    reductions associated with the January 2009 restructuring,
    increased efforts to reduce our controllable spending and lower
    equity compensation costs;

•

$51 million of non-cash abandonment charges recognized
    during 2009 associated with the determination that we would not
    pursue alternatives associated with the development and
    implementation of a revenue management system that would include
    the licensed SAP software;

•

2008 cost decreases attributable to lower risk management
    expenses due to reduced actuarial projections of claim losses
    for workers’ compensation and auto and general liability
    claims and lower bonus expense due to relatively weak
    performance against established targets offset, in part, by
    costs incurred for a proposed acquisition;

•

restructuring charges of $9 million in 2009 and
    $6 million in 2007; and

•

employee healthcare coverage expenses in the third quarter of
    2007 due to unusually high claims activity.

Interest Income and Expense

— Our
    interest expense was $426 million in 2009,
    $455 million in 2008, and $521 million in 2007.
    Interest income was $13 million in 2009, $19 million
    in 2008, and $47 million in 2007. The decreases in interest
    income and expense for the periods presented are primarily
    attributable to significant declines in market interest rates.

Interest expense

— Lower market interest rates
    have increased the benefits to interest expense provided by our
    active interest rate swap agreements and reduced the interest
    expense associated with our tax-exempt bonds and our Canadian
    Credit Facility. The impacts of each of these items on our
    interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007 are summarized below:

Interest rate swaps

— We use interest rate
    swaps to manage our exposure to changes in market interest
    rates. The impacts to interest expense of our interest rate
    swaps are primarily related to (i) net periodic settlements
    of current interest on our active interest rate swaps and
    (ii) the amortization of previously terminated interest
    rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense. The
    following table summarizes the impact of periodic settlements of
    active swap agreements and the impact of terminated swap
    agreements on our results of operations (in millions):

)

Terminated swap agreements(b)




$

$

(11

)

(a)

These amounts represent the net of our periodic variable-rate
    interest obligations and the swap counterparties’
    fixed-rate interest obligations. Our variable-rate obligations
    are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR. Three-month
    LIBOR rates have varied significantly during the reported
    periods. During



2007, the three-month LIBOR exceeded 5.0% for most of the year,
    while during 2008 the rate was as high as 4.8% and as low as
    1.4% and during 2009 rates were consistently below 1.0% for most
    of the year.

(b)

The amortization to interest expense of terminated swap
    agreements has decreased due to the maturity of certain
    previously hedged senior notes. In addition, in 2008, this
    amount included a $10 million net reduction in interest
    expense associated with the early retirement of
    $244 million of 8.75% senior notes. At
    December 31, 2009, $18 million (on a pre-tax basis) of
    the carrying value of debt associated with terminated swap
    agreements is scheduled to be reclassified as a reduction to
    interest expense over the next twelve months.

Tax-exempt bonds

— Certain of our tax-exempt
    bonds are subject to remarketing processes that result in
    periodic adjustments to the interest rates of the bonds. As of
    December 31, 2009, $817 million of our tax-exempt
    bonds are “variable-rate” instruments and re-price on
    either a daily or weekly basis. We also have tax-exempt bonds
    with term interest rate periods that end before the bonds’
    scheduled maturities and $387 million of these bonds were
    re-priced during 2009. These remarketing processes have
    significantly reduced the weighted average interest rates of our
    tax-exempt bonds, which decreased from 4.5% at December 31,
    2007 to 4.0% at December 31, 2008 and 3.4% at
    December 31, 2009.

Canadian credit facility

— Borrowings
    outstanding under our Canadian Credit Facility have short-term
    maturities, but are generally renewed at maturity under the
    terms of the facility, which results in the effective interest
    rates of the borrowings being reset to reflect current market
    interest rates. The weighted average interest rates of
    borrowings outstanding under our Canadian Credit Facility have
    decreased from 5.3% as of December 31, 2007 to 3.3% as of
    December 31, 2008 and 1.3% at December 31, 2009.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company issued an additional
    $600 million of senior notes, which mature in 2039 and have
    a coupon rate of 6.125%. This debt issuance is expected to
    increase our average debt balances and our interest expense in
    2010 as we currently expect to use the proceeds from the
    issuance to make various acquisitions and investments, rather
    than as a source for the repayment of existing debt. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s

debt-to-total

capital ratio was 57.4%, which continues to be consistent with
    our targeted long-term

debt-to-total

capitalization of up to 60%.

Interest income

— When comparing 2009 with
    2008, the decrease in interest income is generally related to
    the decline in market interest rates, offset, in part, by an
    increase in our cash and cash equivalents balances throughout
    the year. As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash
    equivalents balances exceeded $1 billion, due in large part
    to our $600 million issuance of senior notes during the
    fourth quarter 2009. We currently expect to utilize a
    significant portion of these funds for investments and
    acquisitions in the first half of 2010, including our
    anticipated purchase of a 40% equity investment in Shanghai
    Environment Group, which is discussed in Note 11 of our
    Consolidated Financial Statements, and additional investments in
    our

waste-to-energy

and solid waste businesses.

When comparing 2008 with 2007, the decrease in interest income
    is primarily due to (i) significant declines in market
    interest rates; (ii) the recognition of $7 million in
    interest income during the first quarter of 2007 for the
    favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern
    Group; and (iii) a decrease in our average cash and
    investment balances.

Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities

— During 2007, our “Equity in net losses
    of unconsolidated entities” was primarily related to our
    equity interests in two coal-based synthetic fuel production
    facilities. The equity losses generated by the facilities were
    offset by the tax benefits realized as a result of these
    investments as discussed below within

Provision for income
    taxes.

Provision for Income Taxes

— We recorded
    provisions for income taxes of $413 million in 2009,
    $669 million in 2008 and $540 million in 2007. These
    tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of
    approximately 28.1%, 37.2% and 30.9% for each of the three
    years, respectively. At current income levels, we expect that
    our 2010 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 38%.
    The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is primarily
    affected by (i) variations in our income before taxes;
    (ii) the utilization of capital loss carry-back; (iii) the
    realization of state net operating loss and credit
    carry-forwards; (iv) changes in effective



state and Canadian statutory tax rates; (v) differences in
    the impacts of tax audit settlements; and (vi) the impact
    of non-conventional fuel tax credits, which expired at the end
    of 2007. The impacts of these items are summarized below:

•

Utilization of capital loss carry-back

— During
    2009, we generated a capital loss from the liquidation of a
    foreign subsidiary and determined that the capital loss could be
    utilized to offset capital gains from prior years (specifically
    2006 and 2007). The utilization of this capital loss resulted in
    a reduction to our 2009 “Provision for income taxes”
    of $65 million, representing a 4.4 percentage point
    reduction in our effective tax rate.

•

State net operating loss and credit carry-forwards

—
    During 2009 and 2008, we realized state net operating loss and
    credit carry-forwards by reducing related valuation allowances,
    resulting in a reduction to our “Provision for income
    taxes” for those periods of $35 million and
    $3 million, respectively. No corresponding benefit was
    recognized in 2007.

•

Canadian and state effective tax rates

— During
    2009, the provincial tax rates in Ontario were reduced, which
    resulted in a $13 million tax benefit as a result of the
    revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. During 2007,
    the Canadian federal government enacted tax rate reductions,
    which resulted in a $30 million tax benefit for the
    revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. We did not
    have any comparable adjustments to Canadian rates during 2008.
    During 2009, our current state tax rate increased from 6.0% to
    6.25% and our deferred state tax rate increased from 5.5% to
    5.75%. During 2008, our current state tax rate increased from
    5.5% to 6.0%. The increases in these rates was primarily due to
    changes in state law.

•

Tax audit settlements

— Excluding the effects
    of interest income, the settlement of various tax audits
    resulted in reductions in income tax expense of $11 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, $26 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 and $40 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007.

•

Non-conventional fuel tax credits

— Through
    December 31, 2007, non-conventional fuel tax credits were
    derived from our landfills and our investments in two
    coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities. Our income
    taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 included
    $50 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits. These tax
    credits resulted in a 2.9 percentage point reduction in our
    effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Non-conventional fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2007.

Noncontrolling Interests

— Net income
    attributable to noncontrolling interests was $66 million in
    2009, $41 million in 2008 and $46 million in 2007. In
    each period, these amounts have been principally related to
    third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability
    companies that own three

waste-to-energy

facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group. The profitability
    of one of the LLCs has improved in 2009 as a result of an
    increase in the rentals paid by Wheelabrator to the LLC for the
    lease of one of the facilities. We have consolidated these
    variable interest entities since 2003 because we have determined
    that we are the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes. We
    are in the process of reconsidering our consolidation of the
    LLCs as a result of revised authoritative guidance associated
    with the consolidation of variable interest entities. Additional
    information related to these investments is included in
    Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has
    also been affected by significant adjustments recognized in
    consolidated operating expenses for changes in the present value
    of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets
    as a result of changes in the U.S. Treasury rates used to
    measure these balances.

Landfill
    and Environmental Remediation Discussion and
    Analysis

We owned or operated 268 solid waste and five hazardous waste
    landfills at December 31, 2009 and we owned or operated 267
    solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009 and



2008, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and
    tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated
    landfills, is shown below (in millions):

Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31,
    2009 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average
    remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated
    landfills is approximately 35 years. Many of our landfills
    have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is
    currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted
    disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether
    to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated
    future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking
    expansion permits at 39 of our landfills that meet the expansion
    criteria outlined in the

Critical Accounting Estimates and
    Assumptions

section above. Although no assurances can be
    made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted
    as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for
    all owned or operated landfills is approximately 41 years
    when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume.

The number of landfills we own or operate as of
    December 31, 2009, segregated by their estimated operating
    lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:

(a)

From an operating perspective, landfills we operate through
    lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own
    the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the
    landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the
    life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the closure
    and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease.

(b)

For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and
    we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the
    life of the landfill. The property owner is generally
    responsible for closure and post-closure obligations under our
    operating contracts.

In 2009, we acquired 3 landfills, closed 4 landfills
    and resumed operations at one landfill that we had previously
    closed.



(b)

These amounts include 1.5 million tons at December 31,
    2009 and 2.0 million tons at December 31, 2008 that
    were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial
    purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted
    airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are
    frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for
    composting and clean dirt for

on-site

construction projects.

When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of
    closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally
    transfer the management of the site, including any remediation
    activities, to our closed sites management group. As of
    December 31, 2009, our closed sites management group
    manages 201 closed landfills.

Landfill Assets

— We capitalize various costs
    that we incur to ready a landfill to accept waste. These costs
    generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill
    footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting,
    excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate
    collection systems, landfill gas collection systems,
    environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill
    gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future
    costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.

The following table reflects the total cost basis of our
    landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization
    as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and summarizes
    significant changes in these amounts during 2009 (in millions):

As of December 31, 2009, we estimate that we will spend
    approximately $500 million in 2010, and approximately
    $1 billion in 2011 and 2012 combined for the construction
    and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of
    landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and
    spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in
    landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements
    and other factors impacting landfill operations.

Landfill and Environmental Remediation
    Liabilities

— As we accept waste at our landfills,
    we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include
    liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in
    accordance with authoritative guidance associated with
    accounting for asset retirement obligations, and are discussed
    in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also
    have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have
    incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by
    operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed
    before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize
    environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the
    liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely
    remedy can be reasonably estimated.



The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our
    environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and summarizes significant changes in these
    amounts during 2009 (in millions):

Landfill Costs and Expenses

— As disclosed in
    the

Operating Expenses

section above, our landfill
    operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement
    obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments
    to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets,
    leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill
    remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following
    table summarizes these costs for each of the three years
    indicated (in millions):

$


$


$


The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been
    most significantly affected by accounting for changes in the
    risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present
    value of our environmental remediation liabilities and
    environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the
    rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the
    weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying
    obligations. Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, our leachate
    collection costs were higher in certain of our geographic Groups
    than they had been in 2007, primarily due to increased
    precipitation in the affected regions.

Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a
    component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense,
    includes the following:

•

the amortization of landfill capital costs, including
    (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and
    (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and
    construction required to develop our landfills to their
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and

•

the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill
    final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including
    (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and
    (ii) projected asset retirement costs.

Amortization expense is recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is
    calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis
    of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the
    corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and
    closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally
    incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its
    entire operating life, and are, therefore, amortized on a per
    ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final
    capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific
    final capping event, and are, therefore, amortized on a per ton
    basis using each discrete capping event’s estimated
    airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per
    ton amortization rates.



The following table calculates our landfill airspace
    amortization expense on a per ton basis:

Years Ended December 31,

$


$

Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)




Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton

$

3.90

$

4.01

$

3.86

Different per ton amortization rates are applied at each of our
    273 landfills, and per ton amortization rates vary
    significantly from one landfill to another due to
    (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs
    and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for
    landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost
    basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire.
    Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured
    on a per ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of
    volumes we receive across the Company

year-over-year.

The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace
    amortization expense per ton for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 has also been affected by
    the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for
    changes in our estimates related to our final capping, closure
    and post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was
    reduced by $14 million in 2009, $3 million in 2008 and
    $17 million in 2007, for the effects of these changes in
    estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense
    resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of final
    capping events that were generally the result of
    (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies
    of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed
    us to delay spending for final capping activities; (ii)
    effectively managing the cost of final capping material and
    construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in
    reduced or deferred final capping costs.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our
    liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our
    present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may
    arise during the year as a result of changing business
    conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working
    capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
    ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
    construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
    to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment;
    (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at

waste-to-energy

and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and
    equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and
    post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) repaying
    debt and discharging other obligations; and
    (vii) investments in acquisitions that we believe will be
    accretive and provide continued growth in our business. We also
    are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on
    their investment through our capital allocation program that
    provides for dividend payments, share repurchases and
    investments in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive
    and provide continued growth in our business.

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money
    market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations,
    all of which have original maturities of three months or less.
    The

year-over-year

increase in our cash balances is largely attributable to our
    November 2009 senior note issuance, which is discussed below. We
    intend to use a significant portion of the proceeds of this debt
    issuance to fund investments and acquisitions during the first
    half of 2010, including our anticipated purchase of a 40% equity
    investment in Shanghai Environment Group, which is discussed in
    Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, as well
    as additional investments in our

waste-to-energy

and solid waste businesses. Pending application of the offering
    proceeds as described, we have temporarily invested the proceeds
    in money market funds, which are reflected as cash equivalents
    in our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

—
    Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of
    (i) funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations;
    and (ii) funds received from the issuance of tax-exempt
    bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or
    facilities. These balances are primarily included within
    long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Debt

— We use long-term borrowings in addition
    to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall
    financial strategy to support and grow our business. We
    primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a
    long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities
    when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as
    of December 31, 2009 are described in Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31,
    2008 to December 31, 2009 can primarily be attributed to
    (i) $1,749 million of cash borrowings, including
    $793 million in net proceeds from the February 2009
    issuance of $800 million of senior notes and
    $592 million in net proceeds from the November 2009
    issuance of $600 million of senior notes; (ii) the
    cash repayment of $1,335 million of outstanding borrowings;
    (iii) proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings of
    $130 million; (iv) a $59 million decrease in the
    carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest
    rate swaps; (v) a $40 million increase in the carrying
    value of our debt due to foreign currency translation; and
    (vi) the impacts of accounting for other non-cash changes
    in our debt balances due to acquisitions, interest accretion and
    capital leases.

As of December 31, 2009, we had (i) $998 million
    of debt maturing within twelve months, consisting primarily of
    U.S.$255 million under our Canadian credit facility and
    $600 million of 7.375% senior notes that mature in



August 2010; and (ii) $767 million of fixed-rate
    tax-exempt borrowings subject to re-pricing within the next
    twelve months. The amount reported as the current portion of
    long-term debt as of December 31, 2009 excludes certain of
    these amounts because we have the intent and ability to
    refinance portions of our current maturities on a long-term
    basis. Refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information related to our classification of
    current maturities based on our intent and ability, given the
    capacity available under our revolving credit facility and
    Canadian credit facility, to refinance certain of these
    borrowings on a long-term basis.

We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and
    financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our
    outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31,

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating
    cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below:

•

Decrease in earnings

— Our income from
    operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased
    by $419 million on a

year-over-year

basis. However, this earnings decline included the impact of the
    following non-cash charges:

•

The determination to abandon the SAP software as our revenue
    management system resulted in non-cash impairment charges of
    $51 million

•

The recognition of a $27 million non-cash charge in the
    fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of a change in expectations
    for the future operations of a landfill in California.

Further, approximately $55 million of the

year-over-year

decrease in earnings is related to the impact of divestiture
    gains and gains on sale of assets for which the cash flow
    impacts are reflected in investing activities in the caption
    “Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales
    of assets.”

The comparison of our 2009 and 2008 income from operations was
    also affected by an $86 million decrease in non-cash
    charges attributable to (i) equity-based compensation
    expense; (ii) interest accretion on landfill liabilities;
    and (iii) interest accretion and discount rate adjustments
    on environmental remediation liabilities



and recovery assets. While the decrease in non-cash charges
    favorably affected our earnings comparison, there is no impact
    on net cash provided by operating activities.

•

Change in receivables

— There was a significant
    decrease in the operating cash flows provided by changes in our
    receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and
    divestitures, when comparing 2009 with 2008. This decrease is
    primarily attributable to unusual activity in 2008, including
    (i) the significant decrease in sequential quarter revenues
    when comparing the fourth quarter of 2008 with the third quarter
    of 2008, which was driven by the decline in the demand and
    market prices for recyclable commodities; and (ii) the
    collection of a $60 million outstanding receivable related
    to our investments in synthetic fuel production facilities that
    provided us with Section 45K tax credits through 2007.

•

Decreased income tax payments

— Cash paid for
    income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with
    equity-based transactions, was approximately $140 million
    lower on a

year-over-year

basis. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed
    in the

Provision for income taxes

section above.

•

Decreased interest payments

— Cash paid for
    interest was approximately $60 million lower on a

year-over-year

basis. This decrease is primarily due to a decline in market
    interest rates, which (i) increased the benefits to our
    interest costs provided by our active interest rate swap
    agreements; and (ii) reduced the interest costs associated
    with our variable-rate tax-exempt debt.

•

Decreased bonus payments

— Employee bonus
    payments earned in 2008, which were paid in the first quarter of
    2009, were lower than the bonus payments earned in 2007 but paid
    in 2008 due to the relative strength of our financial
    performance against incentive measures in 2007 as compared with
    2008. The

year-over-year

decrease in cash bonuses favorably affected the comparison of
    our cash flow from operations by approximately $35 million.

•

Termination of interest rate swaps

— In
    December 2009, we elected to terminate interest rate swaps with
    a notional amount of $350 million that were scheduled to
    mature in November 2012. Upon termination of the swaps, we
    received $20 million in cash for their fair value plus
    accrued interest receivable. The cash proceeds received from the
    termination of interest rate swap agreements have been
    classified as a change in other assets within “Net cash
    provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows.

•

Accounts payable processes

— We continue to
    work to improve our working capital management, including
    continuing to manage our accounts payable process in a manner
    that provides optimal cash management, which has favorably
    impacted our

year-over-year

cash flow from operations change by approximately
    $20 million.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    operating cash flows for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below:

•

Earnings decline

— Our income from operations,
    net of depreciation and amortization, decreased by
    $41 million, on a

year-over-year

basis, which negatively affected our cash flow from operations
    in 2008.

•

Receivables

— The change in our trade
    receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and
    divestitures, provided a source of cash of approximately
    $185 million in 2008. In 2008, our receivables balances
    declined primarily due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues
    as compared with the prior year, but also due to improved
    efficiency of collections. Additionally, during the third
    quarter of 2008, we collected an outstanding receivable related
    to our investments in the synthetic fuel production facilities
    that provided us with Section 45K tax credits through 2007.
    Approximately $60 million of the cash we received
    represented a refund of amounts that we paid to the facilities
    during 2006 and 2007 for which we did not ultimately realize a
    tax benefit, and was reflected as an operating cash inflow.

•

Increased income tax payments

— Cash paid for
    income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with
    equity-based transactions, was approximately $170 million
    higher on a

year-over-year

basis, due in large part to an increase in both our taxable
    income and our effective tax rate. The comparability of our
    effective tax rates is discussed in the

Provision for income
    taxes

section above. In addition, the overpayment of income
    taxes in 2006 reduced our 2007 tax payments.



•

Decreased interest payments

— Cash paid
    for interest was approximately $65 million lower on a

year-over-year

basis. This decline is due primarily to a decline in our
    weighted average borrowing rate, which can be attributed to the
    maturity of higher rate debt that we refinanced at lower rates
    and a decline in market rates.

•

Accounts payable processes

— In 2008, we
    began various initiatives to improve our working capital
    management, including reviewing our accounts payable process to
    ensure vendor payments are made on a basis that results in more
    optimal cash management. The changes made to the timing of our
    vendor payments favorably impacted our cash flow from operations
    on a

year-over-year

basis by approximately $30 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Acquisitions —

Our spending on acquisitions
    increased from $90 million during 2007 to $280 million
    during 2008 and to $281 million in 2009 due to an increased
    focus on acquisitions and other investments.

•

Divestitures —

Proceeds from divestitures (net
    of cash divested) and other sales of assets were
    $28 million in 2009, $112 million in 2008, and
    $278 million in 2007. Our proceeds from divestitures for
    all three years have been driven by the divestiture of
    underperforming and non-strategic operations. The decrease in
    proceeds from divestitures in 2008 and 2009 was largely a result
    of having fewer underperforming operations to sell as part of
    our

fix-or-seek-exit

initiative.

•

Capital expenditures —

We used
    $1,179 million during 2009 for capital expenditures,
    compared with $1,221 million in 2008 and
    $1,211 million in 2007.

•

Net receipts from restricted funds —

Net funds
    received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which
    are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for
    our capital needs, contributed $196 million to our
    investing activities in 2009 compared with $178 million in
    2008 and $120 million in 2007.

•

Purchases and sales of short-term investments —

Net sales of short-term investments provided
    $184 million of cash in 2007. We used proceeds from the
    sale of our short-term investments to provide cash that we used
    to fund our common stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt
    repayments, which are discussed below. We did not hold any
    short-term investments during 2008 or 2009.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Share repurchases and dividend payments —

Our
    2009, 2008 and 2007 share repurchases and dividend payments
    have been made in accordance with capital allocation programs
    approved by our Board of Directors.

We paid $226 million for share repurchases in 2009,
    compared with $410 million in 2008 and $1,421 million
    in 2007. We repurchased approximately 7 million,
    12 million and 40 million shares of our common stock
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The significant declines
    in share repurchases for 2008 and 2009 are largely attributable
    to the suspension of our share repurchases in late 2008 given
    the state of the financial markets and the economy. Given the
    stabilization of the capital markets and economic conditions, we
    elected to resume our share repurchases during the third quarter
    of 2009.

We paid an aggregate of $569 million in cash dividends
    during 2009, compared with $531 million in 2008 and
    $495 million in 2007. The increase in dividend payments is
    due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.24 in
    2007, to $0.27 in 2008 and to $0.29 in 2009.

In December 2009, the Board of Directors announced that it
    expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.315 per
    share for dividends declared in 2010. All future share
    repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and the
    Board of Directors will declare dividends at their discretion,
    with any decisions dependent on various factors, including our
    net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future
    acquisitions and investments and other factors the Board may
    deem relevant.



•

Proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of options and
    warrants —

The exercise of common stock options
    and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a
    total of $24 million of financing cash inflows during 2009
    compared with $44 million during 2008 and $168 million
    in 2007.

•

Net debt repayments —

Net debt borrowings were
    $414 million in 2009, and net debt repayments were
    $260 million in 2008 and $256 million in 2007. The
    following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and
    debt repayments made during each year (in millions):

This summary excludes the impacts of non-cash borrowings and
    debt repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, these non-cash financing activities were
    primarily associated with our tax-exempt bond financings.
    Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issuances, net of principal
    repayments made directly from trust funds, were
    $105 million in 2009, $169 million in 2008 and
    $144 million in 2007.

•

Accrued liabilities for checks written in excess of cash
    balances —

Changes in our accrued liabilities for
    checks written in excess of cash balances are reflected as
    “Other” financing activities in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows. There are significant changes in these
    accrued liability balances as of each year-end, which is
    generally attributable to the timing of cash deposits.

(h)

In August 2009, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 40%
    equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group, a subsidiary of
    Shanghai Chengtou Holding, for approximately $140 million.
    As of December 31, 2009, our investment was subject to
    regulatory approval. Accordingly, the impact of this cash
    investment was excluded from amounts reported herein. The
    Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China
    approved the transaction in January 2010 and we currently expect
    the transaction to close during the first half of 2010.

Liquidity
    Impacts of Uncertain Tax Positions

As discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax
    benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily
    included as a component of long-term “Other
    liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the
    Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the
    liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve
    months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would
    make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but
    do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations
    will materially affect our liquidity.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated
    entities as discussed in the

Guarantees

section of
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These
    arrangements have not materially affected our financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity during the year
    ended December 31, 2009 nor are they expected to have a
    material impact on our future financial position, results of
    operations or liquidity.

Seasonal
    Trends and Inflation

Our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in
    the summer months, primarily due to the traditional seasonal
    increase in the volume of construction and demolition waste. The
    volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions
    where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months.
    Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations
    typically reflect these seasonal trends, although we saw a
    significantly weaker seasonal volume increase during 2009 than
    we generally experience.

Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend
    to occur during the second half of the year, such as the
    hurricanes experienced by our Southern Group, can actually
    increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for
    several reasons, including significant mobilization costs, such
    revenue often generates earnings at comparatively lower margins.
    Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
    months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
    fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent years, we
    believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near
    future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on
    our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2009,
    approximately 35% of our collection revenues were generated
    under long-term franchise agreements with municipalities or
    similar local or regional authorities. These contractual
    agreements generally provide for price adjustments based on
    various indicies intended to measure inflation. Additionally,
    management’s estimates associated with inflation have had,
    and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for
    landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

—
    In June 2009, the FASB issued revised authoritative guidance
    associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities.
    This revised guidance replaces the current quantitative-based
    assessment for determining which enterprise has a controlling
    interest in a variable interest entity with an approach that is
    now primarily qualitative. This qualitative approach focuses on
    identifying the enterprise that has (i) the power to direct
    the activities of the variable interest entity that can most
    significantly impact the entity’s performance; and
    (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the variable interest entity. This revised
    guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an
    enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
    entity rather than a reassessment only upon



the occurrence of specific events. The new FASB-issued
    authoritative guidance associated with the consolidation of
    variable interest entities is effective for the Company
    January 1, 2010. The change in accounting may either be
    applied by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to
    retained earnings on the date of adoption or by retrospectively
    restating one or more years and recognizing a cumulative-effect
    adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the
    earliest year restated. We are currently in the process of
    assessing the provisions of this revised guidance and have not
    determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

— In
    September 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance
    associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This
    amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual
    deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate
    units of accounting and modifies the manner in which transaction
    consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable
    deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance
    associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are
    effective for the Company January 1, 2011, although the
    FASB does permit early adoption of the guidance provided that it
    is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of
    adoption. The new accounting standard may be applied either
    retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to
    arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date
    of adoption. We are in the process of assessing the provisions
    of this new guidance and currently do not expect that the
    adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. However, our adoption of this guidance may
    significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future
    revenue arrangements to the extent they are material.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market
    risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency
    rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use
    derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our
    derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that
    provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of
    December 31, 2009, all of our derivative transactions were
    related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are
    exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our
    derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative
    positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the
    creditworthiness of the counterparties.

Interest Rate Exposure

— Our exposure to
    market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to
    our financing activities, although our interest costs can also
    be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance
    needs, which are discussed in the

Financial Assurance and
    Insurance Obligations

section of Item 1.

As of December 31, 2009, we had $8.8 billion of
    long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair
    value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives,
    discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of
    approximately $3.0 billion of our outstanding debt
    obligations are subject to change during 2010. The most
    significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are
    (i) $1.1 billion of “receive fixed, pay
    variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding
    fixed-rate senior notes; (ii) $817 million of
    tax-exempt bonds that are subject to re-pricing on either a
    daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process;
    (iii) $767 million of tax-exempt bonds with term
    interest rate periods that are subject to re-pricing within
    twelve months; and (iv) $257 million of outstanding
    advances under our Canadian Credit Facility. As of
    December 31, 2008, the effective interest rates of
    approximately $3.4 billion of our outstanding debt
    obligations was subject to change within twelve months.

The decrease in outstanding debt obligations exposed to variable
    interest rates in 2009 is generally as a result of an
    $850 million decrease in the notional amount of outstanding
    interest rate swaps offset, in part, by an increase in the
    portion of our outstanding tax-exempt bonds with term interest
    rate periods that are subject to re-pricing within twelve
    months. The decline in our variable-rate debt obligations has
    reduced the potential volatility to our operating results and
    cash flows that results from fluctuations in market interest
    rates. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point
    increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate
    debt obligations would increase our 2010 interest expense by
    approximately $23 million.

Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest
    rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for
    certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through
    the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve
    months. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we have
    Treasury rate locks with a notional amount



of $200 million and forward-starting interest rate swaps
    with a notional amount of $525 million. The fair value of
    our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate
    derivative instruments can increase or decrease significantly if
    market interest rates change.

We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market
    rate changes might affect the fair value of our market
    risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses
    are inherently limited because they reflect a singular,
    hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may
    vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one
    percentage point increase in interest rates across all
    maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these
    instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined
    debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately
    $610 million at December 31, 2009.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have
    significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets
    held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets
    are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments
    including money market funds that invest in U.S. government
    obligations with original maturities of three months or less.
    Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we
    believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to
    interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

Commodity Price Exposure —

In the normal course
    of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that
    expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for
    commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including
    aluminum, old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint; and
    electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices
    in the markets where we operate. During the three years ended
    December 31, 2009, we generally have not entered into
    derivatives to hedge the risks associated with changes in the
    market prices of these commodities. Alternatively, we attempt to
    manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on
    capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for
    the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for
    these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also
    increase or decrease.

During 2009, approximately 34% of the electricity revenue at our

waste-to-energy

facilities was subject to current market rates, and we currently
    expect that nearly 50% of our electricity revenues at our
    waste-to-energy facilities will be at market rates in 2010. Our
    exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices
    for electricity has increased because several long-term power
    purchase agreements have expired. The energy markets have
    changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed
    and we have found that medium- and long-term electricity
    contracts are less favorable in the current environment. As we
    renegotiate our power-purchase agreements, we expect that a more
    substantial portion of our energy sales at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and landfill

gas-to-energy

plants will be based on current market rates. Accordingly, in
    2010 we will be implementing a more actively managed energy
    program, which will include a hedging strategy intended to
    decrease the exposure of our revenues to volatility due to
    market prices for electricity.

Currency Rate Exposure

— From time to
    time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact
    of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany
    Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign
    currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial
    position or results of operations for the periods presented. In
    addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could
    significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency
    derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not
    have a material impact to the Company.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal
    controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to
    (i) the reliability of our financial reporting;
    (ii) the reliability of the preparation and presentation of
    the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States; and (iii) the safeguarding of assets from
    unauthorized use or disposition.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Through this
    evaluation, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our
    internal controls. There are inherent limitations in the
    effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
    reporting; however, based on our evaluation, we have concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Waste Management, Inc. at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007 the Company adopted
    certain provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”
    related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
    Additionally, effective January 1, 2009, the Company
    adopted certain provisions of ASC Topic 810,
    “Consolidation” related to noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Waste
    Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 16, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Waste Management,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 16,
    2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007

1.

Business

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation;
    Waste Management’s wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which
    Waste Management or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary
    as described in Note 20. Waste Management is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries.
    When the terms “the Company,” “we,”
    “us” or “our” are used in this document,
    those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
    subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When
    we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to Waste
    Management, Inc., the parent holding company.

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and

waste-to-energy

services. In providing these services, we actively pursue
    projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive
    difference for our environment, including recovering and
    processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into
    a renewable energy source. Our customers include commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste
    management companies, electric utilities and governmental
    entities.

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through five
    Groups. Our four geographic Groups, which include our Eastern,
    Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, provide collection,
    transfer, recycling and disposal services. Our fifth Group is
    the Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to-energy

services. We also provide additional services that are not
    managed through our five Groups, which are presented in this
    report as “Other.” Additional information related to
    our segments, including changes in the basis for our reported
    segments from December 31, 2008, can be found under
    “Reclassifications” in Note 2 and in Note 21.

Accounting
    Changes and Reclassifications

Accounting
    Changes

Fair Value Measurements

— In September 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative
    guidance associated with fair value measurements. This guidance
    defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
    In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the
    guidance for all non-financial assets and non-financial
    liabilities, except those that are measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis. Accordingly, we adopted this guidance for
    assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring
    basis effective January 1, 2008 and adopted the guidance
    for non-financial assets and liabilities measured on a
    non-recurring basis effective January 1, 2009. The
    application of the fair value framework did not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Business Combinations

— In December 2007, the
    FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated
    with business combinations. This guidance clarified and revised
    the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This guidance also
    addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired
    in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements
    related to business combinations. Effective January 1,
    2009, we adopted the FASB’s revised guidance associated
    with business combinations. The portions of this guidance that
    relate to business combinations completed before January 1,
    2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. Further, business combinations completed
    in 2009, which are discussed in Note 19, have not been
    material to our financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, to the extent that future business
    combinations are material, our adoption of the FASB’s
    revised authoritative guidance associated with business
    combinations may significantly impact our accounting and
    reporting for future acquisitions, principally as a result of
    (i) expanded requirements to value acquired assets,
    liabilities and contingencies at



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

their fair values when such amounts can be determined; and
    (ii) the requirement that acquisition-related transaction
    and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than
    capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements

— In December 2007, the FASB issued
    authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for
    the de-consolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance also
    established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
    ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be
    reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. We
    adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The presentation
    and disclosure requirements of this guidance, which must be
    applied retrospectively for all periods presented, have resulted
    in reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial
    information and the remeasurement of our 2008 and 2007 effective
    tax rates, which are discussed in Note 9.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

— In
    June 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance associated
    with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. This guidance
    prescribed a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. This guidance also
    addressed the de-recognition, classification and disclosure of
    tax positions, as well as the accounting for related interest
    and penalties. In May 2007, the FASB issued authoritative
    guidance associated with the criteria that must be evaluated in
    determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and
    should be recognized as a tax benefit. Our adoption of this
    guidance effective January 1, 2007 resulted in the
    recognition of a $28 million increase in our liabilities
    for unrecognized tax benefits, a $32 million increase in
    our non-current deferred tax assets and a $4 million
    increase in our beginning retained earnings as a cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle. Refer to Note 9
    for additional information about our unrecognized tax benefits.

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post-retirement Plans

— In September 2006,
    the FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance
    associated with the accounting and reporting of post-retirement
    benefit plans. This guidance required companies to recognize the
    overfunded or underfunded status of their defined benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans as an asset or liability
    and to recognize changes in that funded status through
    comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. We
    adopted these recognition provisions effective December 31,
    2006. The FASB’s revised guidance also required companies
    to measure the funded status of defined benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans as of their year-end reporting date.
    These measurement date provisions were effective for us as of
    December 31, 2008. We applied the measurement provisions by
    measuring our benefit obligations as of September 30, 2007,
    our prior measurement date, and recognizing a pro-rata share of
    net benefit costs for the transition period from October 1,
    2007 to December 31, 2008 as a cumulative effect of change
    in accounting principle in retained earnings as of
    December 31, 2008. The application of the recognition and
    measurement provisions of this revised authoritative guidance
    did not have a material impact on our financial position or
    results of operations for the periods presented.

Subsequent Events

— In May 2009, the FASB
    established standards related to accounting for, and disclosure
    of, events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before
    financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
    We have adopted the provisions of this guidance, which became
    effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. We have evaluated subsequent events through
    the date and time the financial statements were issued on
    February 16, 2010. No material subsequent events have
    occurred since December 31, 2009 that required recognition
    or disclosure in our current period financial statements.

Reclassifications

Segments

— During the first quarter of 2009, we
    transferred responsibility for the oversight of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our
    four geographic Groups. We believe that, by integrating the
    management of our recycling facilities’ operations with our
    other solid waste business, we can more efficiently provide
    comprehensive environmental solutions to our customers and
    ensure that we are focusing on maximizing the profitability and
    return on invested capital of our business on an integrated
    basis. As a result of this operational change, we also changed
    the way we

review the financial results of our geographic Groups. Beginning
    in 2009, the financial results of our material recovery
    facilities and secondary processing facilities are included as a
    component of their respective geographic Group and the financial
    results of our recycling brokerage business and electronics
    recycling services are included as part of our “Other”

    all periods presented to provide financial information that
    consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
    geographic Group operations. Refer to Note 21 for further

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of WMI, its wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we
    have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All
    material intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities in which we do not have a
    controlling financial interest are accounted for under either
    the equity method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.

Estimates
    and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity,
    revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and
    assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent
    on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of
    precision from data available or simply cannot be readily
    calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases,
    these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we
    must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial
    statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates
    and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of
    uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
    environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, and
    self-insurance reserves and recoveries. Each of these items is
    discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could
    differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use
    in the preparation of our financial statements.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit
    and money market funds that invest in United States government
    obligations with original maturities of three months or less.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents, investments held within our trust funds and escrow
    accounts, accounts receivable and derivative instruments. We
    make efforts to control our exposure to credit risk associated
    with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other
    financial interests with a diverse group of credit-worthy
    financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial
    instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument;
    and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension
    that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring
    procedures, although generally we do not have collateral
    requirements for credit extensions. Our overall credit risk
    associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large
    number of geographically diverse customers we service. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, no single customer represented
    greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.

Trade
    and Other Receivables

Our receivables are recorded when billed or when cash is
    advanced and represent claims against third parties that will be
    settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of
    the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated
    net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful
    accounts based on historical

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

collection trends; type of customer, such as municipal or
    commercial; the age of outstanding receivables; and existing
    economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that specific receivable balances may be impaired,
    further consideration is given to the collectibility of those
    balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Past-due
    receivable balances are written off when our internal collection
    efforts have been unsuccessful. Also, we recognize interest
    income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable as the
    interest accrues under the terms of the notes.

Landfill
    Accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize
    various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept
    waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land
    (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer
    property), permitting, excavation, liner material and
    installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest,

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes asset retirement
    costs, which represent estimates of future costs associated with
    landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities.
    These costs are discussed below.

Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

—
    Following is a description of our asset retirement activities
    and our related accounting:

•

Final Capping

— Involves the installation of
    flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage
    and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill
    where total airspace capacity has been consumed. Final capping
    asset retirement obligations are recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific final
    capping event with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Each final capping event is accounted for as a discrete
    obligation and recorded as an asset and a liability based on
    estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated
    with each final capping event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the
    final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required),
    demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs
    incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but before the
    landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state
    regulatory agency. These costs are accrued as an asset
    retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of
    the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Closure obligations are accrued over the life of the
    landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows
    associated with performing closure activities.

•

Post-Closure

— Involves the maintenance and
    monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by
    the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to
    maintain and monitor landfill sites for a

30-year

period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an
    asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the
    life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the
    landfill asset. Post-closure obligations are accrued over the
    life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash
    flows associated with performing post-closure activities.

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from
    our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our
    estimates are based on our interpretation of current
    requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to
    approximate fair value. Absent quoted market prices, the
    estimate of fair value should be based on the best available
    information, including the results of present value techniques.
    In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our
    obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use
    historical experience, professional engineering judgment and
    quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the
    fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize
    these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract
    with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those
    instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the
    incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component
    of operating income when the work is performed.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Once we have determined the final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time
    of payment and discount those expected future costs back to
    present value. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, we inflated these costs in current dollars until the
    expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 2.5%. We
    discount these costs to present value using the credit-adjusted,
    risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred
    consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in
    expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated
    cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the
    current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the
    historical weighted-average rate of the recorded obligation. As
    a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to each
    individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted-average
    rate applicable to our asset retirement obligations at
    December 31, 2009 is between 6.0% and 8.0%, the range of
    the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rates effective since we
    adopted the FASB’s authoritative guidance related to asset
    retirement obligations in 2003. We expect to apply a
    credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate of 6.0% to liabilities
    incurred in the first quarter of 2010.

We record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity
    consumed through the current period. The fair value of final
    capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the
    airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the
    expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of
    closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our
    estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire
    landfill and the expected timing of each closure and
    post-closure activity. Because these obligations are measured at
    estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in
    the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure
    and post-closure activities could result in a material change in
    these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We
    assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our
    recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts
    change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or
    extent of future final capping and closure and post-closure
    activities typically result in both (i) a current
    adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset; and
    (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded
    prospectively over either the remaining capacity of the related
    discrete final capping event or the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace (as defined below) of the landfill. Any
    changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the
    landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our
    amortization policy, which would generally result in
    amortization expense being recognized prospectively over the
    remaining capacity of the final capping event or the remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as
    appropriate. Changes in such estimates associated with airspace
    that has been fully utilized result in an adjustment to the
    recorded liability and landfill assets with an immediate
    corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace amortization
    expense.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the
    timing and cost of future final capping, closure and
    post-closure of fully utilized airspace resulted in
    $14 million, $3 million and $17 million in net
    credits to landfill airspace amortization expense, respectively,
    with the majority of these credits resulting from revised
    estimates associated with final capping changes. In managing our
    landfills, our engineers look for ways to reduce or defer our
    construction costs, including final capping costs. The benefit
    recognized in these years was generally the result of
    (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies
    of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed
    us to delay spending for final capping activities;
    (ii) effectively managing the cost of final capping
    material and construction; or (iii) landfill expansions
    that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping costs.

Interest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure
    liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and
    is recorded as final capping, closure and post-closure expense,
    which is included in “Operating” costs and expenses
    within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The
    amortizable basis of a landfill includes (i) amounts
    previously expended and capitalized; (ii) capitalized
    landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs;
    (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs
    required to develop the landfill site to its remaining permitted
    and



WASTE

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expansion capacity; and (iv) projected asset retirement
    costs related to landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities.

Amortization is recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis, applying expense as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is
    calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis
    of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the
    corresponding asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do
    not own, but operate through operating or lease arrangements,
    the rate per ton is calculated based on expected capacity to be
    utilized over the lesser of the contractual term of the
    underlying agreement or the life of the landfill.

We apply the following guidelines in determining a
    landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:

•

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently
    unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances.
    First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort,
    we must generally expect the initial expansion permit
    application to be submitted within one year, and the final
    expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we
    must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is
    likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval of our Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 39 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2009, 14 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Nine of these landfills required
    approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or
    political opposition that could impede the expansion process.
    The remaining five landfills required approval primarily due to
    the permit application processes not meeting the one- or
    five-year requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement costs related to final capping, and closure and
    post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the
    landfill.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or
    AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the
    measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is
    then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of
    settlement that is forecasted will take into account several
    site-specific factors including current and projected mix of
    waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated
    number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste,
    anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or
    recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In
    addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a
    subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group, and the
    AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as
    necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that
    the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the
    life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill
    approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and
    deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the
    corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization
    rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final
    capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure
    activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be
    capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if
    the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined
    that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in
    calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be
    required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly
    higher amortization expense. If it is determined that the
    likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote,
    the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are
    expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— We are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that
    existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include
    potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations,
    settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as
    costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up,
    such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental
    internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for
    expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations
    when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.
    We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation
    and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on
    a number of estimates and assumptions.

Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we
    estimate costs required to remediate sites based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.

There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the
    costs associated with the likely remedy of a site. In these
    cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our
    best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the
    low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges,
    our aggregate potential liability would be approximately
    $150 million higher on a discounted basis than the
    $256 million recorded in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements as of December 31, 2009.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation is
    inherently difficult. Determining the method and ultimate cost
    of remediation requires that a number of assumptions be made.
    Our ultimate responsibility may differ materially from current
    estimates. It is possible that technological, regulatory or
    enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies,
    the inability to identify other PRPs, the inability of other
    PRPs to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities, or
    other factors could require us to record additional liabilities.
    Additionally, our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities
    could result in revisions that could cause upward or downward
    adjustments to income from operations.

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular
    environmental remediation liability and the timing of the
    payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in
    current dollars (by 2.5% at both December 31, 2009 and
    2008) until the expected time of payment and discount the
    cost to present value using a risk-free discount rate, which is
    based on the rate for United States Treasury bonds with a term
    approximating the weighted average period until settlement of
    the underlying obligation. We determine the risk-free discount
    rate and the inflation rate on an annual basis unless interim
    changes would significantly impact our results of operations.
    For remedial liabilities that have been discounted, we include
    interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in
    “Operating” costs and expenses in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the
    impacts of revisions in the risk-free discount rate applied to
    our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets
    during the reported periods (in millions) and the risk-free
    discount rate applied as of each reporting date:

In 2009, $9 million of the reduction in

    noncontrolling interests.

The portion of our recorded environmental remediation
    liabilities that has never been subject to inflation or
    discounting as the amounts and timing of payments are not
    readily determinable was $44 million at December 31,
    2009 and $47 million at December 31, 2008. Had we not
    inflated and discounted any portion of our environmental
    remediation liability, the amount recorded would have increased
    by $20 million at December 31, 2009 and decreased by
    $6 million at December 31, 2008.

Property
    and Equipment (exclusive of landfills, discussed
    above)

We record property and equipment at cost. Expenditures for major
    additions and improvements are capitalized and maintenance
    activities are expensed as incurred. We depreciate property and
    equipment over the estimated useful life of the asset using the
    straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for our
    depreciable property and equipment. When property and equipment
    are retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any
    resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations as
    an offset or increase to operating expense for the period.

We include capitalized costs associated with developing or
    obtaining internal-use software within furniture, fixtures and
    office equipment. These costs include direct external costs of
    materials and services used in developing or obtaining the
    software and internal costs for employees directly associated
    with the software development project. As of December 31,
    2009, capitalized costs for software placed in service, net of
    accumulated depreciation, were $33 million. In addition,
    our furniture, fixtures and office equipment includes
    $46 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $90 million as of December 31, 2008 for costs incurred
    for software under development. The significant decrease in
    capitalized costs for software under development from
    December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 is attributable
    to the recognition of a $51 million charge recognized
    during 2009 as a result of our determination to abandon the SAP
    waste and recycling revenue management software. Refer to
    Note 13 for additional information related to the
    management determination to abandon this software development
    project.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill, transfer station or

waste-to-energy

facility and equipment such as compactors. Our leases have
    varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase options,
    escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations
    that we consider in determining minimum lease payments. The
    leases are classified as either operating leases or capital
    leases, as appropriate.

Operating Leases (excluding landfills discussed
    below)

— The majority of our leases are operating
    leases. This classification generally can be attributed to
    either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease payments as a
    result of real property lease obligations that vary based on the
    volume of waste we receive or process or (ii) minimum lease
    terms that are much shorter than the assets’ economic
    useful lives. Management expects that in the normal course of
    business our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by other
    leases, or replaced with fixed asset expenditures. Our rent
    expense during each of the last three years and our future
    minimum operating lease payments for each of the next five years
    for which we are contractually obligated as of December 31,
    2009 are disclosed in Note 11.

Capital Leases

(

excluding landfills discussed
    below)

— Assets under capital leases are
    capitalized using interest rates determined at the inception of
    each lease and are amortized over either the useful life of the
    asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a straight-line
    basis. The present value of the related lease payments is
    recorded as a debt obligation. Our future minimum annual capital
    lease payments are included in our total future debt obligations
    as disclosed in Note 7.

Landfill Leases

— From an operating
    perspective, landfills that we lease are similar to landfills we
    own because generally we own the landfill’s operating
    permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term,
    which in many cases is the life of the landfill. As a result,
    our landfill leases are generally capital leases. The most
    significant portion of our rental obligations for landfill
    leases is contingent upon operating factors such as disposal
    volumes and often there are no contractual minimum rental
    obligations. Contingent rental obligations are expensed as
    incurred. For landfill capital leases that provide for minimum
    contractual rental obligations, we record the



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

present value of the minimum obligation as part of the landfill
    asset, which is amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the
    landfill.

Acquisitions

We generally recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    in business combinations, including contingent assets and
    liabilities, based on fair value estimates as of the date of
    acquisition.

Contingent Consideration —

In certain
    acquisitions, we agree to pay additional amounts to sellers
    contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of
    certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue levels,
    targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for
    expanded landfill airspace. For acquisitions completed in 2009,
    we have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations
    based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition
    with any differences between the acquisition-date fair value and
    the ultimate settlement of the obligations being recognized as
    an adjustment to income from operations. For acquisitions
    completed before 2009, these obligations were recognized as
    incurred and accounted for as an adjustment to the initial
    purchase price of the acquired assets.

Assumed Assets and Liabilities —

Assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies such as pre-acquisition
    environmental matters and litigation are recognized at their
    acquisition-date fair value when their respective fair values
    can be determined. If the fair values of such contingencies
    cannot be determined, they are recognized at the acquisition
    date if the contingencies are probable and an amount can be
    reasonably estimated. Acquisition-date fair value estimates are
    revised as necessary if, and when, additional information
    regarding these contingencies becomes available to further
    define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Beginning in 2009, all acquisition-related transaction costs
    have been expensed as incurred. For acquisitions completed
    before 2009, direct costs incurred for a business combination
    were accounted for as part of the cost of the acquired business.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value
    of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize
    goodwill, but as discussed in the “Asset impairments”
    section below, we assess our goodwill for impairment at least
    annually.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts,
    customer lists, covenants

not-to-compete,

licenses, permits (other than landfill permits, as all
    landfill-related intangible assets are combined with landfill
    tangible assets and amortized using our landfill amortization
    policy), and other contracts. Other intangible assets are
    recorded at cost and are amortized using either a 150% declining
    balance approach or a straight-line basis as we determine
    appropriate. Customer contracts and customer lists are generally
    amortized over seven to ten years. Covenants

not-to-compete

are amortized over the term of the non-compete covenant, which
    is generally two to five years. Licenses, permits and other
    contracts are amortized over the definitive terms of the related
    agreements. If the underlying agreement does not contain
    definitive terms and the useful life is determined to be
    indefinite, the asset is not amortized.

Asset
    Impairments

We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes
    in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators. If an
    impairment indicator occurs, , we perform a test of
    recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or
    asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If
    cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for
    a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has
    occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the
    projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of
    undiscounted expected future cash flows, we



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset
    or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally
    determined by considering (i) internally developed
    discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset
    group; (ii) actual third-party valuations;

and/or

(iii) information available regarding the current market
    for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group
    is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset
    or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is
    recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and
    is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures,
    asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash
    flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary
    from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our
    ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.
    There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills
    and goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its
    carrying value, including goodwill. We use a combination of two
    valuation methods, a market approach and an income approach, to
    estimate the fair value of our operating segments. Fair value
    computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of
    factors, including projected future operating results, economic
    projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable
    marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in
    applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these
    two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair
    value of our operating segments.

The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the
    aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar
    characteristics of our business as a multiple of their reported
    cash flows. We then apply that multiple to our operating
    segment’s cash flows to estimate their fair value. We
    believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a
    fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with
    operations and economic characteristics comparable to our
    operating segments.

The income approach is based on the long-term projected future
    cash flows of our operating segments. We discount the estimated
    cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of
    capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash
    flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe
    that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair
    value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected
    long-term performance considering the economic and market
    conditions that generally affect our business.

Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim
    basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that
    would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of
    goodwill has been impaired. Refer to Note 6 for additional
    information related to goodwill impairment considerations made
    during the reported periods.

Restricted
    Trust and Escrow Accounts

As of December 31, 2009, our restricted trust and escrow
    accounts consist principally of (i) funds deposited for
    purposes of settling landfill closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation obligations; and (ii) funds
    received from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds held in trust for
    the construction of various projects or facilities. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $306 million and
    $381 million, respectively, of restricted trust and escrow
    accounts, which are primarily included in long-term “Other
    assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Closure, Post-Closure and Environmental Remediation
    Funds

— At several of our landfills, we provide
    financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust
    funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling closure,
    post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. Balances
    maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will
    fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements;
    (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual
    arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of funds for qualifying
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities;
    (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills; and
    (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments
    held in the trust fund or escrow accounts.

Tax-Exempt Bond Funds

— We obtain funds from
    the issuance of industrial revenue bonds for the construction of
    collection and disposal facilities and for equipment necessary
    to provide waste management services. Proceeds from these
    arrangements are directly deposited into trust accounts, and we
    do not have the ability to use the funds in regular operating
    activities. Accordingly, these borrowings are excluded from
    financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. At the time our construction and equipment expenditures
    have been documented and approved by the applicable bond
    trustee, the funds are released and we receive cash. These
    amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows as an investing activity when the cash is released from
    the trust funds. Generally, the funds are fully expended within
    a few years of the debt issuance. When the debt matures, we
    repay our obligation with cash on hand and the debt repayments
    are included as a financing activity in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows.

Foreign
    Currency

We have operations in Canada. The functional currency of our
    Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars. The assets and
    liabilities of our foreign operations are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance sheet
    date. Revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars
    using the average exchange rate during the period. The resulting
    translation difference is reflected as a component of
    comprehensive income.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage our
    risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. We use interest rate swaps to maintain
    a strategic portion of our long-term debt obligations at
    variable, market-driven interest rates. In 2009, we entered into
    interest rate derivatives in anticipation of senior note
    issuances planned for 2010 through 2014 to effectively lock in a
    fixed interest rate for those anticipated issuances. Foreign
    currency exchange rate derivatives are used to hedge our
    exposure to changes in exchange rates for anticipated cash
    transactions between WM Holdings and its Canadian
    subsidiaries.

We obtain current valuations of our interest rate and foreign
    currency hedging instruments from third-party pricing models.
    The estimated fair values of derivatives used to hedge risks
    fluctuate over time and should be viewed in relation to the
    underlying hedged transaction and the overall management of our
    exposure to fluctuations in the underlying risks. The fair value
    of derivatives is included in other current assets, other
    long-term assets, accrued liabilities or other long-term
    liabilities, as appropriate. Any ineffectiveness present in
    either fair value or cash flow hedges is recognized immediately
    in earnings without offset. There was no significant
    ineffectiveness in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

•

Interest Rate Derivatives

— Our “receive
    fixed, pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with
    outstanding fixed-rate senior notes have been designated as fair
    value hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, derivative
    assets are accounted for as an increase in the carrying value of
    our underlying debt obligations and derivative liabilities are
    accounted for as a decrease in the carrying value of our
    underlying debt instruments. These fair value adjustments are
    deferred and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
    over the remaining term of the hedged instruments. Treasury
    locks and forward-starting swaps executed in 2009 are hedges of
    anticipated debt issuances and have been designated as cash flow
    hedges for accounting purposes. Unrealized changes in the fair
    value of these derivative instruments are recorded in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income” within the
    equity section of our Consolidated



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Balance Sheets. The associated balance in other comprehensive
    income will be reclassified to earnings as the hedged cash flows
    occur. The impacts of our use of interest rate derivatives on
    the carrying value of our debt, accumulated other comprehensive
    income and interest expense are discussed in Note 8.

•

Foreign Currency Derivatives

— Our foreign
    currency derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges
    for accounting purposes, which results in the unrealized changes
    in the fair value of the derivative instruments being recorded
    in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” within the
    equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    associated balance in other comprehensive income is reclassified
    to earnings as the hedged cash flows occur. In each of the
    periods presented, these derivatives have effectively mitigated
    the impacts of the hedged transactions, resulting in immaterial
    impacts to our results of operations for the periods presented.

Self-Insurance
    Reserves and Recoveries

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. The exposure for
    unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but
    not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance
    of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and
    historical trends and data. The gross estimated liability
    associated with settling unpaid claims is included in
    “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets if expected to be settled within one year, or otherwise
    is included in long-term “Other liabilities.”
    Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities
    are reflected as current “Other receivables” or
    long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is
    probable.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste
    collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services and the
    sale of recycled commodities, electricity and steam. The fees
    charged for our services are generally defined in our service
    agreements and vary based on contract-specific terms such as
    frequency of service, weight, volume and the general market
    factors influencing a region’s rates. The fees we charge
    for our services generally include fuel surcharges, which are
    intended to pass through increased direct and indirect costs
    incurred because of changes in market prices for fuel. We
    generally recognize revenue as services are performed or
    products are delivered. For example, revenue typically is
    recognized as waste is collected, tons are received at our
    landfills or transfer stations, recycling commodities are
    delivered or as kilowatts are delivered to a customer by a

waste-to-energy

facility or independent power production plant.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services
    include, among others, certain residential contracts that are
    billed on a quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance
    billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as
    revenue in the period service is provided.

Capitalized
    Interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development,
    including internal-use software and landfill expansion projects,
    and on certain assets under construction, including operating
    landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, total interest costs
    were $443 million, $472 million, and
    $543 million, respectively, of which $17 million for
    2009, $17 million for 2008, and $22 million for 2007,
    were capitalized, primarily for landfill construction costs. The
    capitalization of interest for operating landfills is based on
    the costs incurred in the pursuit of probable landfill
    expansions and on discrete landfill cell construction projects
    that are expected to exceed $500,000 and require over
    60 days to construct. In addition to the direct cost of the
    cell construction project, the calculation of capitalized
    interest includes an allocated portion of the common landfill
    site costs. The common landfill site costs include the
    development costs of a landfill project or the purchase price of
    an operating landfill, and the ongoing infrastructure costs
    benefiting the landfill over its useful life. These costs are
    amortized to expense in a manner consistent with other landfill
    site costs.

Income
    Taxes

The Company is subject to income tax in the United States,
    Canada and Puerto Rico. Current tax obligations associated with
    our provision for income taxes are reflected in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of “Accrued
    liabilities,” and the deferred tax obligations are
    reflected in “Deferred income taxes.”

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the
    financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The
    deferred income tax provision represents the change during the
    reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
    Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards
    and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant
    judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of
    deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when,
    despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
    supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged
    and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change,
    we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.

To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing
    authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have
    been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax
    expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with
    respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    We are party to pending or threatened legal proceedings covering
    a wide range of matters in various jurisdictions. It is not
    always possible to predict the outcome of litigation, as it is
    subject to many uncertainties. Additionally, it is not always
    possible for management to make a meaningful estimate of the
    potential loss or range of loss associated with such
    contingencies.

Our recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2009 include
    the impacts of inflating certain of these costs based on our
    expectations for the timing of cash settlement and of
    discounting certain of these costs to present value. Anticipated

At several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by
    depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts
    for purposes of settling closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation obligations. The fair value of these escrow accounts
    and trust funds was $231 million at December 31, 2009

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill was $5,632 million as of December 31, 2009
    compared with $5,462 million as of December 31, 2008.
    The $170 million increase in our goodwill during 2009 was
    primarily related to consideration paid for acquisitions in
    excess of net assets acquired of $125 million and
    accounting for foreign currency translation.

We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual,
    fourth quarter goodwill impairment tests in 2009, 2008 or 2007.
    Additionally, we did not encounter any events or changes in
    circumstances that indicated that an impairment was more likely
    than not during interim periods in 2009, 2008 or 2007. However,
    there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at
    any time in the future.

As previously disclosed, in late 2008, there was a rapid and
    sharp decline in recyclable commodity prices due to a
    significant decrease in demand for recyclable commodities, both
    domestically and internationally. This significant shift in
    recycling market conditions was analyzed for purposes of our
    2008 annual goodwill impairment test, although no impairment was
    required. Consistent with our expectations, the unprecedented
    declines in recyclable commodity prices and demand experienced
    during late 2008 and early 2009 were temporary in nature.
    Accordingly, we believe that the estimates and assumptions made
    with respect to the fair value of our recycling operations for
    our annual goodwill impairment tests in 2008 and 2009
    appropriately considered the effects of commodity risks on this
    business.

Debt
    Classification

As of December 31, 2009, we had (i) $998 million
    of debt maturing within twelve months, consisting primarily of
    U.S.$255 million under our Canadian credit facility and
    $600 million of 7.375% senior notes that mature in
    August 2010; and (ii) $767 million of fixed-rate
    tax-exempt borrowings subject to re-pricing within the next
    twelve months. Under accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States, this $1,765 million of debt must be
    classified as current unless we have the intent and ability to
    refinance it on a long-term basis. As discussed below, as of
    December 31, 2009, we had the intent and ability to
    refinance $1,016 million of this debt on a long-term basis.
    We have classified the remaining $749 million as current
    obligations as of December 31, 2009.

All of the borrowings outstanding under the Canadian credit
    facility mature less than one year from the date of issuance,
    but may be renewed under the terms of the facility, which
    matures in November 2012. As of December 31, 2009, we
    intend to repay U.S.$57 million of the outstanding
    borrowings under the facility with available cash during the
    next twelve months and refinance the remaining balance under the
    terms of the facility. As a result, as of December 31,
    2009, U.S.$198 million of advances under the facility were
    classified as long-term based on our intent and ability to
    refinance the obligations on a long-term basis under the terms
    of the facility.

Additionally, we have classified the $767 million of
    tax-exempt bonds subject to re-pricing within twelve months as
    long-term as of December 31, 2009 based on our intent and
    ability to refinance any failed re-pricings using our
    $2.4 billion revolving credit facility. Although we also
    intend to refinance the $600 million of senior notes
    maturing in August 2010 on a long-term basis, an aggregate of
    $1,578 million of capacity under our revolving credit
    facility is currently utilized to support outstanding letters of
    credit and we currently forecast available capacity under the
    facility during the next twelve months to be $4 million
    less than the current available capacity. After giving effect to
    these items, only $51 million of capacity is forecasted to
    be available under the revolving credit facility, giving us the
    ability to classify only $51 million of the August 2010
    maturity as long-term as of December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, we also have $771 million of
    variable-rate tax-exempt bonds and $46 million of
    variable-rate tax-exempt project bonds. The interest rates on
    these bonds are reset on either a daily or weekly basis through
    a remarketing process. If the remarketing agent is unable to
    remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds
    to us. These bonds are supported by letters of credit
    guaranteeing repayment of the bonds in this event. We classified
    these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    at December 31, 2009 because the borrowings are supported
    by letters of credit issued under our five-year revolving credit
    facility, which is long-term.

Access
    to and Utilization of Credit Facilities

Revolving Credit Facility

— In August 2006, WMI
    entered into a five-year, $2.4 billion revolving credit
    facility. This facility provides us with credit capacity to be
    used for either cash borrowings or to support letters of credit.
    At December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings and
    $1,578 million of letters of credit issued and supported by
    the facility. The unused and available credit capacity of the
    facility was $822 million as of December 31, 2009.

The $300 million of outstanding borrowings at
    December 31, 2008 was repaid in the first quarter of 2009
    with proceeds from the February 2009 issuance of senior notes
    discussed below.

Letter of Credit Facilities

— As of
    December 31, 2009, we have a $175 million letter of
    credit facility that expires in June 2010, a $105 million
    letter of credit facility that expires in June 2013 and a
    $100 million letter of credit facility that expires in
    December 2014. These facilities are currently being used to back
    letters of credit issued to support our bonding and financial
    assurance needs. Our letters of credit generally have terms
    providing for automatic renewal after one year. In the event of
    an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit, the amount of the
    draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts
    into a term loan for the remaining term of the respective



WASTE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

facility. Through December 31, 2009, we had not experienced
    any unreimbursed draws on letters of credit under these
    facilities.

As of December 31, 2009, no borrowings were outstanding
    under these letter of credit facilities, and we had unused and
    available credit capacity of $9 million.

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
    Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility
    agreement with an initial credit capacity of up to
    C$410 million. The agreement was entered into to facilitate
    WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from
    its Canadian subsidiaries. In December 2007, we amended the
    agreement, increasing the available capacity, which had been
    reduced to C$305 million due to debt repayments, to
    C$340 million. The amendment also extended the maturity
    date of the facility to November 2012 and added an uncommitted
    option to increase the capacity by an additional
    C$25 million.

As of December 31, 2009, we had U.S.$257 million of
    principal (U.S.$255 million net of discount) outstanding
    under this credit facility. Advances under the facility do not
    accrue interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we
    initially received were for the principal amount of the advances
    net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the
    advance, and the debt was initially recorded based on the net
    proceeds received. The advances have a weighted average
    effective interest rate of 1.3% at December 31, 2009, which
    is being amortized to interest expense with a corresponding
    increase in our recorded debt obligation using the effective
    interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2009,
    we increased the carrying value of the debt for the recognition
    of U.S.$6 million of interest expense. A total of
    U.S.$31 million of advances under the facility matured
    during 2009 and were repaid with available cash. Accounting for
    changes in the Canadian currency translation rate increased the
    carrying value of these borrowings by U.S.$38 million
    during 2009.

Debt
    Borrowings and Repayments

Senior Notes

— In February 2009, we issued
    $350 million of 6.375% senior notes due March 2015 and
    $450 million of 7.375% senior notes due March 2019.
    The net proceeds from the debt issuance were $793 million.
    A portion of the proceeds was used to repay $300 million of
    outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
    the remaining proceeds were used in repaying $500 million
    of 6.875% senior notes that matured in May 2009.

In November 2009, we issued $600 million of
    6.125% senior notes due in November 2039. The net proceeds
    from the debt issuance were $592 million. We intend to use
    a portion of the proceeds to fund our anticipated purchase of a
    40% equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group for
    approximately $140 million, as discussed in Note 11.
    We are actively pursuing other acquisitions and investment
    opportunities in our waste-to energy and solid waste businesses
    and expect to spend up to an additional $350 million over
    the next six months from the proceeds of this offering on such
    acquisitions and investments. All remaining proceeds will be
    used for general corporate purposes. Pending application of the
    offering proceeds as described, we have temporarily invested the
    proceeds in money market funds, which are reflected as cash
    equivalents in our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

The remaining change in the carrying value of our senior notes
    from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 is due to
    accounting for our

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap agreements, which are accounted for as fair
    value hedges resulting in all fair value adjustments being
    reflected as a component of the carrying value of the underlying
    debt. For additional information regarding our interest rate
    derivatives, refer to Note 8.

Tax-Exempt Bonds

— We actively issue tax-exempt
    bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital
    expenditures. We issued $130 million of tax-exempt bonds
    during 2009. The proceeds from these debt issuances may only be
    used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised,
    which is generally to finance expenditures for landfill
    construction and development, equipment, vehicles and facilities
    in support of our operations. Proceeds from bond issues are held
    in trust until such time as we incur qualified expenditures, at
    which time we are reimbursed from the trust funds. During the
    year ended December 31, 2009, $65 million of our
    tax-exempt bonds were repaid with available cash.



WASTE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Tax-Exempt Project Bonds

— Tax-exempt project
    bonds have been used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the
    development of

waste-to-energy

facilities. These facilities are integral to the local
    communities they serve, and, as such, are supported by long-term
    contracts with multiple municipalities. The bonds generally have
    periodic amortizations that are supported by the cash flow of
    each specific facility being financed. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we repaid $64 million of our
    tax-exempt project bonds with either available cash or debt
    service funds.

Capital Leases and Other

— The decrease in our
    capital leases and other debt obligations in 2009 is primarily
    related to the repayment of various borrowings upon their
    scheduled maturities.

Scheduled Debt and Capital Lease Payments

—
    Scheduled debt and capital lease payments for the next five
    years are as follows: $985 million in 2010;
    $259 million in 2011; $584 million in 2012;
    $174 million in 2013; and $430 million in 2014. Our
    recorded debt and capital lease obligations include non-cash
    adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value
    adjustments for interest rate hedging activities, which have
    been excluded from these amounts because they will not result in
    cash payments.

Secured
    Debt

Our debt balances are generally unsecured, except for
    $70 million of the tax-exempt project bonds outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 that were issued by certain subsidiaries
    within our Wheelabrator Group. These bonds are secured by the
    related subsidiaries’ assets that have a carrying value of
    $301 million and the related subsidiaries’ future
    revenue.

Debt
    Covenants

Our revolving credit facility and certain other financing
    agreements contain financial covenants. The most restrictive of
    these financial covenants are contained in our revolving credit
    facility. The following table summarizes the requirements of
    these financial covenants and the results of the calculation, as
    defined by the revolving credit facility:

Our revolving credit facility and senior notes also contain

    indebtedness, types of investments and net worth. We monitor our
    compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they
    significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or
    financing arrangements typical for our business. As of
    December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenants
    and restrictions under all of our debt agreements.

    Rate Swaps

We use interest rate swaps to maintain a portion of our debt
    obligations at variable market interest rates. As of
    December 31, 2009, we had approximately $5.4 billion
    in fixed-rate senior notes outstanding. The interest payments on
    $1.1 billion, or 20%, of these senior notes have been
    swapped to variable interest rates to protect the debt against
    changes in fair value due to changes in benchmark interest
    rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    $4.5 billion in fixed-rate senior notes outstanding, of
    which $2.0 billion, or 43%, had been swapped to variable
    interest rates. The significant terms of our interest rate swap

The decrease in the notional amount of our interest rate swaps

    (i) the scheduled maturity of interest rate swaps with a
    notional amount of $500 million in May 2009; and
    (ii) our election to terminate interest rate swaps with a
    notional amount of $350 million in December 2009. The
    terminated interest rate swaps were scheduled to mature in
    November 2012. Upon termination of the swaps, we received
    $20 million in cash for their fair value plus accrued
    interest receivable. The associated fair value adjustments to
    long-term debt will be amortized as a reduction to interest
    expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt using the
    effective interest method. The cash proceeds received from our

We have designated our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges
    of our fixed-rate senior notes. Fair value hedge accounting for
    interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of
    debt instruments by $91 million as of December 31,

These amounts represent the net of our periodic variable-rate
    interest obligations and the swap counterparties’
    fixed-rate interest obligations. Our variable-rate obligations
    are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR. Three-month
    LIBOR rates have varied significantly during the reported
    periods. During 2007, the three-month LIBOR exceeded 5.0% for
    most of the year, while during 2008 the rate was as high as 4.8%
    and as low as 1.4% and during 2009 rates were consistently below
    1.0% for most of the year.

The amortization to interest expense of terminated swap
    agreements has decreased due to the maturity of certain
    previously hedged senior notes. In addition, in 2008, this
    amount included a $10 million net reduction in interest
    expense associated with the early retirement of
    $244 million of 8.75% senior notes. At
    December 31, 2009, $18 million (on a pre-tax basis) of
    the carrying value of debt associated with terminated swap
    agreements is scheduled to be reclassified as a reduction to
    interest expense over the next twelve months.

Treasury
    Rate Locks

During the third quarter of 2009, we entered into Treasury rate
    locks with a total notional value of $200 million to hedge
    the risk of changes in semi-annual interest payments that are
    expected for senior notes that the Company plans to issue late
    in the second quarter of 2010. We have designated our Treasury
    rate lock derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of
    December 31, 2009, the fair value of these interest rate
    derivatives is comprised of $4 million of current assets.
    We recognized pre-tax and after-tax gains of $4 million and
    $2 million, respectively, to other comprehensive income for
    changes in their fair value during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. There was no significant ineffectiveness
    associated with these hedges during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Our “Accumulated other comprehensive income” also
    includes deferred losses, net of taxes, of $16 million as
    of December 31, 2009 and $20 million as of
    December 31, 2008 related to Treasury rate locks that had
    been executed in previous years in anticipation of senior note
    issuances. As these instruments also were designated as cash
    flow hedges, the deferred losses are being reclassified to
    earnings over the term of the hedged cash flows, which extend
    through 2032. As of December 31, 2009, $7 million (on
    a pre-tax basis) is scheduled to be reclassified into interest
    expense over the next twelve months.

Forward-Starting
    Interest Rate Swaps

The Company currently expects to issue fixed-rate debt in March
    2011, November 2012 and March 2014 and has executed
    forward-starting interest rate swaps for these anticipated debt
    issuances with notional amounts of $150 million,
    $200 million and $175 million, respectively. We
    entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps during the
    fourth quarter of 2009 to hedge the risk of changes in the
    anticipated semi-annual interest payments due to fluctuations in
    the forward ten-year LIBOR swap rate. Each of the
    forward-starting swaps has an effective date of the anticipated
    date of debt issuance and a tenor of ten years.

We have designated our forward-starting interest rate swaps as
    cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value
    of these interest rate derivatives is comprised of
    $9 million of long-term assets. We recognized pre-tax and
    after-tax gains of $9 million and $5 million,
    respectively, to other comprehensive income for changes in the
    fair value of our forward-starting interest rate swaps during
    the year ended December 31, 2009. There was no significant
    ineffectiveness associated with these hedges during the year
    ended December 31, 2009.

Credit-Risk
    Features

Certain of our interest rate derivative instruments contain
    provisions related to the Company’s credit ratings. If the

    liability positions. We do not have any derivative instruments
    with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net
    liability position at December 31, 2009.

Foreign
    Exchange Derivatives

We use foreign currency exchange rate derivatives to hedge our
    exposure to changes in exchange rates for anticipated
    intercompany cash transactions between WM Holdings and its
    Canadian subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, we have
    foreign currency forward contracts outstanding for all of our
    anticipated cash flows associated with an outstanding debt
    arrangement with these wholly-owned subsidiaries. The hedged
    cash flows include C$370 million of principal payments,
    which are scheduled for December 31, 2010, and
    C$22 million of interest payments scheduled for
    December 31, 2010. We have designated our foreign currency
    derivatives as cash flow hedges.

Gains or losses on the derivatives and the offsetting losses or
    gains on the hedged items attributable to foreign currency
    exchange risk are recognized in current earnings. We include
    gains and losses on our foreign currency forward contracts as
    adjustments to other income and expense, which is the same
    financial statement line item where offsetting gains and losses
    on the related hedged items are recorded. The following table
    summarizes the pre-

    2009; an after-tax gain of $40 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2008; and an after-tax loss of
    $28 million during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Tax Audit Settlements

— The Company and its
    subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States and
    Puerto Rico, as well as various state and local jurisdictions
    and Canada. We are currently under audit by the IRS and from
    time to time we are audited by other taxing authorities. Our
    audits are in various stages of completion.

During 2009, we effectively settled an IRS audit for the 2008
    tax year as well as various state tax audits. The settlement of
    these tax audits resulted in a reduction to our “Provision
    for income taxes” of $11 million, or $0.02 per diluted
    share, for the year ended December 31, 2009.

During 2008, we settled IRS audits for the 2006 and 2007 tax
    years as well as various state tax audits. In addition, we
    settled Canadian audits for the tax years 2002 through 2005. The
    settlement of these tax audits resulted in a reduction to our
    “Provision for income taxes” of $26 million, or
    $0.05 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

During 2007, we settled an IRS audit for the tax years 2004 and
    2005 and various state tax audits, resulting in a reduction in
    income tax expense of $40 million, or $0.08 per diluted
    share. Our 2007 “Net income attributable to Waste
    Management, Inc.” was also increased by $1 million due
    to interest income recognized from audit settlements.

We are currently in the examination phase of an IRS audit for
    the 2009 tax year and expect this audit to be completed within
    the next 12 months. We participate in the IRS’s
    Compliance Assurance Program, which means we work with the IRS
    throughout the year in order to resolve any material issues
    prior to the filing of our year-end

return. We are also currently undergoing audits by various state
    and local jurisdictions that date back to 1999 and examinations
    associated with Canada that date back to 1998.

Effective State Tax Rate Change

— During 2009,
    our current state tax rate increased from 6.0% to 6.25% and our
    deferred state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 5.75%, resulting
    in an increase to our provision for income taxes of
    $3 million and $6 million, respectively. During 2008,
    our current state tax rate increased from 5.5% to 6.0%,
    resulting in an increase to our income taxes of $5 million.
    The increases in these rates are primarily due to changes in
    state law. The comparison of our effective state tax rate during
    the reported periods has also been affected by

return-to-accrual

adjustments, which reduced our “Provision for income
    taxes” in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Canada Statutory Tax Rate Change

— During 2009,
    the provincial tax rates in Ontario were reduced, which resulted
    in a $13 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation
    of the related deferred tax balances. In addition, during 2007,
    the Canadian federal government enacted tax rate reductions,
    which resulted in a $30 million tax benefit on the
    revaluation of the related deferred tax balances. We did not
    have any comparable adjustments during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

State Net Operating Loss and Credit
    Carry-Forwards

— During 2009 and 2008, we realized
    state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards by reducing
    related valuation allowances resulting in a reduction to our
    “Provision for income taxes” for those periods of
    $35 million and $3 million, respectively. No
    corresponding benefit was recognized in 2007.

Capital Loss Carry-Back

— During 2009, we
    generated a capital loss from the liquidation of a foreign
    subsidiary. We have determined that the capital loss can be
    utilized to offset capital gains from 2006 and 2007, which
    resulted in a reduction to our 2009 “Provision for income
    taxes” of $65 million.

Non-Conventional Fuel Tax Credits

— The
    favorable impact of non-conventional fuel tax credits on our
    2007 effective tax rate was derived from our investments in two
    coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities, which provided
    $37 million of tax credits in 2007, and our landfill

gas-to-energy

projects, which provided $13 million of tax credits in
    2007. The fuel generated from the facilities and our landfill

gas-to-energy

projects qualified for tax credits through 2007 under
    Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code.

Our noncontrolling interests in the coal-based synthetic fuel
    production facilities resulted in the recognition of our
    pro-rata share of the facilities’ losses, the amortization
    of our investments, and additional expense associated with other
    estimated obligations all being recorded as “Equity in net
    losses of unconsolidated entities” within our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. In 2007, our equity in the net losses
    of the facilities was $42 million and we recognized a tax
    benefit associated with the losses and the associated tax
    credits of $53 million.

Unremitted Earnings in Foreign Subsidiaries

—
    At December 31, 2009, remaining unremitted earnings in
    foreign operations were approximately $550 million, which
    are considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision
    for U.S. income taxes has been accrued for these unremitted
    earnings.

At December 31, 2009, we had $28 million of federal
    net operating loss, or NOL, carry-forwards, $1.4 billion of
    state NOL carry-forwards, and $12 million of Canadian NOL
    carry-forwards. The federal and state NOL carry-forwards have
    expiration dates through the year 2029. The Canadian NOL
    carry-forwards are expected to be utilized in 2010. We also
    realized a capital loss, $76 million of which is carried
    forward and expires in 2014. In addition, we have
    $39 million of state tax credit carry-forwards at
    December 31, 2009.

We have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in
    realizing the benefit of certain tax loss and credit
    carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. While we expect to
    realize the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation
    allowances, changes in estimates of future taxable income or in
    tax laws may alter this expectation. The valuation allowance
    increased $4 million in 2009. This was primarily due to an
    increase of $26 million resulting from our capital loss
    carry-forward, offset, in part, by a $24 million state tax
    benefit due to a reduction in the valuation allowance related to
    the expected utilization of state NOL and credit carry-forwards.
    The remaining increase in our valuation allowance was due to
    changes in our gross deferred tax assets due to changes in state
    NOL and credit carry-forwards.

payment of cash within the next twelve months. As of
    December 31, 2009, $50 million of unrecognized tax
    benefits, if recognized in future periods, would impact our
    effective tax rate.

We recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in tax expense. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 we recognized
    approximately $4 million, $4 million and
    $7 million, respectively, of such interest expense as a
    component of our “Provision for income taxes.” We had
    approximately $11 million and $9 million of accrued
    interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We do not have
    any accrued liabilities or expense for penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007.

We anticipate that approximately $20 million of liabilities
    for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and
    $7 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed
    within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals are
    related to various federal and state tax items, none of which
    are material, and are expected to result from audit settlements
    or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
    period.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plans —

Our Waste
    Management retirement savings plans are 401(k) plans that cover
    employees, except those working subject to collective bargaining
    agreements that do not allow for coverage under such plans.
    Employees are generally eligible to participate in the plans
    following a

90-day

waiting period after hire and may contribute as much as 25% of
    their annual compensation, subject to annual contribution
    limitations established by the IRS. Under our largest retirement
    savings plan, we match, in cash, 100% of employee contributions
    on the first 3% of their eligible compensation and match 50% of
    employee contributions on the next 3% of their eligible
    compensation, resulting in a maximum match of 4.5%. Both
    employee and Company contributions vest immediately. Charges to
    “Operating” and “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses for our defined contribution plans
    were $50 million in 2009, $59 million in 2008 and
    $54 million in 2007.

Defined Benefit Plans —

Certain of the
    Company’s subsidiaries sponsor pension plans that cover
    employees not covered by the Savings Plan. These employees are
    members of collective bargaining units. In addition,
    Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary,
    sponsors a pension plan for its former executives and former
    Board members. As of December 31, 2009, the combined
    benefit obligation of these pension plans was $69 million,
    and the plans had $51 million of plan assets, resulting in
    an unfunded benefit obligation for these plans of
    $18 million.

In addition, Waste Management Holdings, Inc. and certain of its
    subsidiaries provided post-retirement health care and other
    benefits to eligible employees. In conjunction with our
    acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998, we limited
    participation in these plans to participating retired employees
    as of December 31, 1998. The unfunded benefit obligation
    for these plans was $45 million at December 31, 2009.

Our accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension
    and other post-retirement plans are $63 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and are included as components of
    “Accrued liabilities” and long-term “Other
    liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed
    multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans for employees who
    participate in collective bargaining agreements. Contributions
    of $34 million in 2009, $35 million in 2008 and
    $33 million in 2007 were charged to operations for our
    subsidiaries’ ongoing participation in these defined
    benefit plans. Our portion of the projected benefit obligation,
    plan assets and unfunded liability of the multi-employer pension
    plans are not material to our financial position. Specific
    benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not
    negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.

Based on our negotiations with collective bargaining units and
    our review of the plans in which they participate, we may
    negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or
    more of these pension plans. If we elect to withdraw from these
    plans, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for
    unfunded vested



WASTE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

benefits at the time of the withdrawal. As discussed in
    Note 11, in 2009 and 2008, we recognized aggregate charges
    of $9 million and $39 million, respectively, to
    “Operating” expenses for the withdrawal of certain
    bargaining units from multi-employer pension plans.

11.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Financial Instruments

— We have obtained
    letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies and
    have established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to
    support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure requirements, environmental
    remediation, and other obligations.

Historically, our revolving credit facilities have been used to
    obtain letters of credit to support our bonding and financial
    assurance needs. We also have three letter of credit facilities
    that were established to provide us with additional sources of
    capacity from which we may obtain letters of credit. These
    facilities are discussed further in Note 7. We obtain
    surety bonds and insurance policies from an entity in which we
    have a noncontrolling financial interest. We also obtain
    insurance from a wholly-owned insurance company, the sole
    business of which is to issue policies for the parent holding
    company and its other subsidiaries, to secure such performance
    obligations. In those instances where our use of financial
    assurance from entities we own or have financial interests in is
    not allowed, we generally have available alternative bonding
    mechanisms.

Because virtually no claims have been made against the financial
    instruments we use to support our obligations, and considering
    our current financial position, management does not expect that
    any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty
    in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for
    our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks
    of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity,
    we continue to evaluate various options to access cost-effective
    sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance coverage for
    protection of our assets and operations from certain risks
    including automobile liability, general liability, real and
    personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’
    and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and
    other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our
    exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to
    the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy.
    Our exposure, however, could increase if our insurers were
    unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation
    insurance programs. For our self-insured retentions, the
    exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including
    incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial
    valuation and internal estimates. The estimated accruals for
    these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences or
    loss development significantly differ from the assumptions used.
    As of December 31, 2009, our general liability insurance
    program carried self-insurance exposures of up to
    $2.5 million per incident and our workers’
    compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures
    of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31,
    2009, our auto liability insurance program included a
    per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to
    additional aggregate deductibles in the $5 million to
    $10 million layer of $4.8 million. Self-insurance
    claims reserves acquired as part of our acquisition of
    WM Holdings in July 1998 were discounted at 3.75% at
    December 31, 2009, 2.25% at December 31, 2008 and 4.0%

(a)

Amounts reported as estimated insurance recoveries are related
    to both paid and unpaid claims liabilities.

(b)

We currently expect substantially all of our recorded
    obligations to be settled in cash in the next five years.

For the 14 months ended January 1, 2000, we insured
    certain risks, including auto, general liability and
    workers’ compensation, with Reliance National Insurance
    Company, whose parent filed for bankruptcy in June 2001. In
    October 2001, the parent and certain of its subsidiaries,
    including Reliance National Insurance Company, were placed in
    liquidation. We believe that because of probable recoveries from
    the liquidation, currently estimated to be $14 million, it
    is unlikely that events relating to Reliance will have a
    material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property,
    environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating Leases

— Rental expense for leased
    properties was $114 million during both 2009 and 2008 and
    $135 million during 2007. These amounts primarily include
    rents under operating leases. Minimum contractual payments due
    for our operating lease obligations are $88 million in
    2010, $75 million in 2011, $72 million in 2012,
    $58 million in 2013 and $47 million in 2014.

Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during
    future periods is significantly less than current year rent
    expense because our significant lease agreements at landfills
    have variable terms based either on a percentage of revenue or a
    rate per ton of waste received.

Purchase Commitment

— We continue to focus on
    the expansion of our

waste-to-energy

business and are actively pursuing various projects in the
    United States and internationally. In August 2009, we entered
    into an agreement to purchase a 40% equity investment in
    Shanghai Environment Group (“SEG”), a subsidiary of
    Shanghai Chengtou Holding, for approximately $140 million.
    As a joint venture partner in SEG, we will participate in the
    operation and management of

waste-to-energy

and other waste services in the Chinese market. SEG will also
    focus on building new

waste-to-energy

facilities in China. The Ministry of Commerce of the
    People’s Republic of China approved the transaction in
    January 2010 and we currently expect the transaction to close
    during the first half of 2010.

    purchase minimum amounts of wood waste, anthracite coal waste
    (culm) and conventional fuels at our independent power
    production plants. These fuel supplies are used to produce steam
    that is sold to industrial and commercial users and electricity
    that is sold to electric utilities, which is generally subject
    to the terms and conditions of long-term contracts. Our purchase
    agreements have been established based on the plants’
    anticipated fuel supply needs to meet the demands of our
    customers under these long-term electricity sale contracts.
    Under our fuel supply

take-or-pay

contracts, we are generally obligated to pay for a minimum
    amount of waste or conventional fuel at a stated rate even if
    such quantities are not required in our operations.

•

Disposal

— We have several agreements expiring
    at various dates through 2052 that require us to dispose of a
    minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under
    these

put-or-pay

agreements, we are required to pay for the agreed upon minimum
    volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the
    facilities. We generally fulfill our minimum contractual
    obligations by disposing of volumes collected in the ordinary
    course of business at these disposal facilities.

•

Waste Paper

— We are party to a waste paper
    purchase agreement that requires us to purchase a minimum number
    of tons of waste paper. The cost per ton we pay is based on
    market prices plus the cost of delivery to our customers. We
    currently expect to fulfill our purchase obligations by 2013.

•

Royalties

— We have various arrangements that
    require us to make royalty payments to third parties including
    prior land owners, lessors or host communities where our
    operations are located. Certain of these agreements provide for
    minimum royalties and require that we make fixed, periodic
    payments. Our obligations expire at various dates through 2025.
    Although minimum payments are required under certain of the
    royalty agreements, our obligations generally are based on per
    ton rates for waste actually received at our transfer stations,
    landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities.

•

Property

— From time to time, we make
    commitments to purchase assets that we expect to use in our
    operations. We are currently party to an agreement to purchase a
    corporate aircraft to replace an existing aircraft, the lease
    for which is expiring in early 2011. The agreement requires that
    we make installment payments between now and delivery, expected
    in 2010, based on the total purchase price for the aircraft.

Our unconditional obligations are established in the ordinary
    course of our business and are structured in a manner that
    provides us with access to important resources at competitive,
    market-driven rates. Our actual future obligations under these
    outstanding agreements are generally quantity driven, and, as a
    result, our associated financial obligations are not fixed as of
    December 31, 2009. For these contracts, we have estimated
    our future obligations based on the current market values of the
    underlying products or services. Our estimated minimum
    obligations for the above-described purchase obligations are
    $166 million in 2010, $61 million in 2011,
    $53 million in 2012, $31 million in 2013 and
    $18 million in 2014. We currently expect the products and
    services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the
    needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect
    these established arrangements to materially impact our future
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following
    guarantee agreements associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2009, WM Holdings has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior
    indebtedness, including its senior notes, revolving credit
    agreement and certain letter of credit facilities, which matures
    through 2039. WMI has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all
    of the senior indebtedness of WM Holdings, which matures
    through 2026. Performance under these guarantee agreements would
    be required if either party defaulted on their respective
    obligations. No additional liabilities have been recorded



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for these guarantees because the underlying obligations are
    reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 23
    for further information.

•

WMI and WM Holdings have guaranteed the tax-exempt bonds
    and other debt obligations of their subsidiaries. If a
    subsidiary fails to meet its obligations associated with its
    debt agreements as they come due, WMI or WM Holdings will
    be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 for information
    related to the balances and maturities of our tax-exempt bonds.

•

We have guaranteed certain financial obligations of
    unconsolidated entities. The related obligations, which mature
    through 2020, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of December 31, 2009, our maximum future
    payments associated with these guarantees are approximately
    $9 million. We do not believe that it is likely that we
    will be required to perform under these guarantees.

•

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market or
    contractually-determined value of certain homeowners’
    properties that are adjacent to certain of our landfills. These
    guarantee agreements extend over the life of the respective
    landfill. Under these agreements, we would be responsible for
    the difference, if any, between the sale value and the
    guaranteed market or contractually-determined value of the
    homeowners’ properties. Generally, it is not possible to
    determine the contingent obligation associated with these
    guarantees, but we do not believe that these contingent
    obligations will have a material effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

We have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested
    assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of
    our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items
    that are currently recorded as obligations, we do not believe
    that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations
    associated with these indemnities. Additionally, under certain
    of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional
    consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial
    targets are achieved post-closing. For acquisitions completed in
    2009, we have recognized liabilities for these contingent
    obligations based on an estimate of the fair value of these
    contingencies at the time of acquisition. For acquisitions
    completed before 2009, the costs associated with any additional
    consideration requirements are accounted for as incurred.
    Contingent obligations related to indemnifications arising from
    our divestitures and contingent consideration provided for by
    our acquisitions are not expected to be material to our
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

WMI and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial
    and general operating obligations of certain of their
    subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual
    obligations as they come due, the guarantor has an unconditional
    obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has
    been recorded for service, financial or general operating
    guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are
    properly accounted for as costs of operations as services are
    provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No
    additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees
    because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly
    accounted for as operating or capital leases, as appropriate.

We currently do not believe it is reasonably likely that we
    would be called upon to perform under these guarantees and do
    not believe that any of the obligations would have a material
    effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Environmental Matters

— A significant portion
    of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be
    characterized as costs of environmental protection, as we are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
    that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to
    remediation activity required by state or local authorities,
    such liabilities include PRP investigations.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The costs associated with these liabilities can include
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as
    incremental internal and external costs directly associated with
    site investigation and

clean-up.

As of December 31, 2009, we had been notified that we are a
    PRP in connection with 74 locations listed on the EPA’s
    National Priorities List, or NPL. Of the 74 sites at which
    claims have been made against us, 16 are sites we own. Each of
    the NPL sites we own was initially developed by others as a
    landfill disposal facility. At each of these facilities, we are
    working in conjunction with the government to characterize or
    remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed
    with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing
    the costs of remediation or are working toward a cost-sharing
    agreement. We generally expect to receive any amounts due from
    other participating parties at or near the time that we make the
    remedial expenditures. The other 58 NPL sites, which we do not
    own, are at various procedural stages under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
    as amended, known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of these proceedings involve allegations that
    certain of our subsidiaries (or their predecessors) transported
    hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our
    acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for
    liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to
    or disposing at the sites. Proceedings arising under Superfund
    typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste
    transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or
    recover costs associated with site investigation and
    remediation, which costs could be substantial and could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. At some of the sites at which we have been
    identified as a PRP, our liability is well defined as a
    consequence of a governmental decision and an agreement among
    liable parties as to the share each will pay for implementing
    that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has been selected
    or the liable parties have been unable to agree on an
    appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain.

Litigation

— In April 2002, two former
    participants in the ERISA plans of Waste Management Holdings,
    Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary we acquired in 1998
    (“WM Holdings”), filed a lawsuit in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in a case
    entitled

William S. Harris, et al. v. James E. Koenig,
    et al

. The lawsuit named as defendants WM Holdings; the
    members of WM Holdings’ Board of Directors prior to
    July 1998; the administrative and investment committees of
    WM Holdings’ ERISA plans and their individual members;
    WMI’s retirement savings plan; the investment committees of
    WMI’s plan and its individual members; and State Street
    Bank & Trust, the trustee and investment manager of
    the ERISA plans. The lawsuit attempts to increase the recovery
    of a class of ERISA plan participants based on allegations
    related to both the events alleged in, and the settlements
    relating to, the securities class action against
    WM Holdings that was settled in 1998 and the securities
    class action against WMI that was settled in 2001. The
    defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaints on the
    pleadings, and the Court granted in part and denied in part the
    defendants’ motions in the first quarter of 2009. However,
    in December 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion
    for leave to file a fourth amended complaint to overcome the
    dismissal of certain complaints and motion for leave to file a
    substitute fourth amended complaint to add two new claims. Each
    of Mr. Pope, Mr. Rothmeier and Ms. San Juan
    Cafferty, members of our Board of Directors, was a member of the
    WM Holdings’ Board of Directors and therefore is a
    named defendant in these actions, as is Mr. Simpson, our
    Chief Financial Officer, by virtue of his membership on the WMI
    ERISA plan Investment Committee at that time. All of the
    defendants intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously.

There are two separate wage and hour lawsuits pending against
    certain of our subsidiaries in California, each seeking class
    certification. The actions were coordinated to proceed in
    San Diego County. Both lawsuits make the same general
    allegations that the defendants failed to comply with certain
    California wage and hour laws, including allegedly failing to
    provide meal and rest periods, and failing to properly pay
    hourly and overtime wages. We deny the claims and intend to
    continue to vigorously defend these matters. Given the inherent
    uncertainties of litigation, the ultimate outcome cannot be
    predicted at this time, nor can possible damages, if any, be
    reasonably estimated. Similarly, a purported class action
    lawsuit was filed against WMI in August 2008 in federal court in
    Minnesota alleging that we violated the Fair Labor Standards
    Act. The court in the Minnesota lawsuit denied the
    plaintiffs’ motion for conditional class certification,
    after which 33 separate lawsuits were filed in 32 states in
    addition to



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Minnesota, all pursuing the same claims contained in the class
    action lawsuit, but on

state-by-state

bases. In December 2009, we reached a tentative settlement to
    resolve all 33 lawsuits.

From time to time, we also are named as defendants in personal
    injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class
    actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported
    waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have
    contaminated the environment or, in certain cases, on the basis
    of having conducted environmental remediation activities at
    sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of
    monitoring of allegedly affected sites and health care
    examinations of allegedly affected persons for a substantial
    period of time even where no actual damage is proven. While we
    believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, the
    ultimate resolution is often substantially uncertain due to the
    difficulty of determining the cause, extent and impact of
    alleged contamination (which may have occurred over a long
    period of time), the potential for successive groups of
    complainants to emerge, the diversity of the individual
    plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential contribution
    or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or other third
    parties, among other factors.

As a large company with operations across the United States and
    Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits,
    disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our
    business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal
    issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against
    us include commercial, customer, and employment-related claims,
    including purported class action lawsuits related to our
    customer service agreements and purported class actions
    involving federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The
    plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or
    injunctive relief, or both. These actions are in various
    procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We
    currently do not believe that any such actions will ultimately
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

WMI’s charter and bylaws require indemnification of its
    officers and directors if statutory standards of conduct have
    been met and allow the advancement of expenses to these
    individuals upon receipt of an undertaking by the individuals to
    repay all expenses if it is ultimately determined that they did
    not meet the required standards of conduct. Additionally, WMI
    has entered into separate indemnification agreements with each
    of the members of its Board of Directors as well as its Chief
    Executive Officer, its President and its Chief Financial
    Officer. The Company may incur substantial expenses in
    connection with the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and
    indemnification obligations in connection with current actions
    involving former officers of the Company or its subsidiaries,
    including the

Harris

lawsuit mentioned above, or other
    actions or proceedings that may be brought against its former or
    current officers, directors and employees.

On March 20, 2008, we filed a lawsuit in state district
    court in Harris County, Texas against SAP AG and SAP America,
    Inc., alleging fraud and breach of contract. The lawsuit relates
    to our 2005 software license from SAP for a waste and recycling
    revenue management system and agreement for SAP to implement the
    software on a fixed-fee basis. We have alleged (i) that SAP
    demonstrated and sold software that SAP represented was a
    mature,

“out-of-the-box”

software solution that met the specific business requirements of
    the Company; (ii) that SAP represented no production,
    modification or customization would be necessary; and
    (iii) that SAP represented the software would be fully
    implemented throughout the Company in 18 months. We are
    vigorously pursuing all claims available, including recovery of
    all payments we have made, costs we have incurred and the
    benefits we have not realized. SAP filed a general denial to the
    suit. Discovery is ongoing and trial is currently scheduled for
    May 2010.

During the first quarter of 2009, we determined to enhance and
    improve our existing revenue management system and not pursue
    alternatives associated with the development and implementation
    of a revenue management system that would include the licensed
    SAP software. Accordingly, after careful consideration of the
    failures and immaturity of the SAP software, we determined to
    abandon any alternative that includes the use of the SAP
    software. Our determination to abandon the SAP software resulted
    in non-cash impairment charges of $51 million. Refer to
    Note 13 for additional information related to the
    impairment charge.

Item 103 of the SEC’s

Regulation S-K

requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a
    governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the
    proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reasonably believe could exceed $100,000. The following matter
    pending as of December 31, 2009 is disclosed in accordance
    with that requirement:

On April 4, 2006, the EPA issued a Finding and Notice of
    Violation (“FNOV”) to Waste Management of Hawaii,
    Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI, and to the
    City and County of Honolulu for alleged violations of the
    federal Clean Air Act, based on alleged failure to submit
    certain reports and design plans required by the EPA, and the
    failure to begin and timely complete the installation of a gas
    collection and control system for the Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary
    Landfill on Oahu. The FNOV did not propose a penalty amount and
    the parties have been in confidential settlement negotiations.
    Pursuant to an indemnity agreement, any penalty assessed will be
    paid by the Company, and not by the City and County of Honolulu.

Multi-Employer, Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—
    Over 20% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining
    agreements, which are with various union locals across the
    United States. As a result of some of these agreements, certain
    of our subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of
    trustee-managed multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans
    for the affected employees. One of the most significant
    multi-employer pension plans in which we participate is the
    Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan
    (“Central States Pension Plan”), which has reported
    that it adopted a rehabilitation plan as a result of its
    actuarial certification for the plan year beginning
    January 1, 2008. The Central States Pension Plan is in
    “critical status,” as defined by the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006.

In connection with our ongoing re-negotiation of various
    collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate
    for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these
    pension plans. In 2008, we recognized an aggregate charge of
    $39 million to “Operating” expenses for the
    withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multi-employer
    pension plans, including a $35 million charge resulting
    from our partial withdrawal from the Central States Pension
    Plan. In 2009, we recognized an additional charge of
    $9 million to “Operating” expenses for the
    withdrawal of certain bargaining units in the East from
    multi-employer pension plans. We do not believe that our
    withdrawals from the multi-employer plans, individually or in
    the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or liquidity. However, withdrawals of other
    bargaining units in the future could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations for the period in which any
    such withdrawals may be recorded.

Tax Matters

— During 2009, we effectively
    settled our 2008 federal tax audit and various state tax audits
    resulting in a tax benefit of $11 million. We are currently
    in the examination phase of an IRS audit for the 2009 tax year
    and expect this audit to be completed within the next
    12 months. We participate in the IRS’s Compliance
    Assurance Program, which means we work with the IRS throughout
    the year in order to resolve any material issues prior to the
    filing of our year-end tax return. We are also currently
    undergoing audits by various state and local jurisdictions that
    date back to 1999 and examinations associated with Canada that
    date back to 1998. To provide for certain potential tax
    exposures, we maintain a liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, the balance of which management believes is adequate.
    Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities are not
    currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our
    results of operations or cash flows.

Restructuring

2009 Restructuring —

In January 2009, we took
    steps to further streamline our organization by
    (i) consolidating our Market Areas; (ii) integrating
    the management of our recycling operations with our other solid
    waste business; and (iii) realigning our Corporate
    organization with this new structure in order to provide support
    functions more efficiently.

Our principal operations are managed through our Groups, which
    are discussed in Note 21. Each of our four geographic
    Groups had been further divided into 45 Market Areas. As a
    result of our restructuring, the Market Areas were consolidated
    into 25 Areas. We found that our larger Market Areas generally
    were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of scale
    that were not present in our smaller Market Areas, and this
    reorganization has allowed



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

us to lower costs and to continue to standardize processes and
    improve productivity. In addition, during the first quarter of
    2009, responsibility for the oversight of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities was transferred from our Waste
    Management Recycle America, or WMRA, organization to our four
    geographic Groups. By integrating the management of our
    recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste
    business, we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive
    environmental solutions to our customers. In addition, as a
    result of this realignment, we have significantly reduced the
    overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our
    business and have increased the geographic Groups’ focus on
    maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of
    our business on an integrated basis.

This restructuring eliminated over 1,500 employee positions
    throughout the Company. During 2009, we recognized
    $50 million of pre-tax charges associated with this
    restructuring, of which $41 million were related to
    employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were
    primarily related to operating lease obligations for property
    that will no longer be utilized. The following table summarizes
    the charges recognized in 2009 for this restructuring by each of
    our reportable segments and our Corporate and Other
    organizations (in millions):

Through December 31, 2009, we had paid approximately
    $36 million of the employee severance and benefit costs
    incurred as a result of this restructuring. The length of time
    we are obligated to make severance payments varies, with the
    longest obligation continuing through the fourth quarter of 2010.

2008 Restructuring —

The $2 million of
    restructuring expenses recognized during 2008 was related to a
    reorganization of customer service functions in our Western
    Group and the realignment of certain operations in our Southern
    Group.

2007 Restructuring

— In 2007, we restructured
    certain operations and functions, resulting in the recognition
    of a charge of $10 million. Approximately $7 million
    of our restructuring costs was incurred by our Corporate
    organization, $2 million was incurred by our Midwest Group
    and $1 million was incurred by our Western Group. These
    charges included $8 million for employee severance and
    benefit costs and $2 million related to operating lease
    agreements.

primarily related to the divestiture of underperforming
    collection operations in our Southern Group; and in 2007, the
    gains were related to the divestiture of underperforming
    collection, transfer and recycling operations in our Eastern,
    Western and Southern Groups.

Asset Impairments (excluding

held-for-sale

impairments)

— Through December 31, 2008, we
    had capitalized $70 million of accumulated costs associated
    with the development of our waste and recycling revenue
    management system. A significant portion of these costs was
    specifically associated with the purchase of the license of
    SAP’s waste and recycling revenue management software and
    the efforts required to develop and configure that software for
    our use. After a failed pilot implementation of the software in
    one of our smallest Market Areas, the development efforts
    associated with the SAP revenue management system were suspended
    in 2007. As disclosed in Note 11, in March 2008, we filed
    suit against SAP and are currently scheduled for trial in May
    2010.

During 2009, we determined to enhance and improve our existing
    revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated
    with the development and implementation of a revenue management
    system that would include the licensed SAP software.
    Accordingly, after careful consideration of the failures of the
    SAP software, we determined to abandon any alternative that
    would include the use of the SAP software. The determination to
    abandon the SAP software as our revenue management system
    resulted in a non-cash charge of $51 million,
    $49 million of which was recognized during the first
    quarter of 2009 and $2 million of which was recognized
    during the fourth quarter of 2009.

We recognized an additional $32 million of impairment
    charges during 2009, $27 million of which was recognized by
    the West Group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully impair
    a landfill in California as a result of a change in our
    expectations for the future operations of the landfill. The
    remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a
    charge required to write down certain of our investments in
    portable self-storage operations to their fair value as a result
    of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those
    operations.

During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge,
    primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our
    Southern Group. During 2007, we recognized $12 million in
    impairment charges related to two landfills in our Southern
    Group. The impairments were necessary as a result of the
    re-evaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and
    the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be
    renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for
    the second landfill.

Capital
    Stock, Share Repurchases and Dividends

Capital
    Stock

As of December 31, 2009, we have 486.1 million shares
    of common stock issued and outstanding. We have 1.5 billion
    shares of authorized common stock with a par value of $0.01 per
    common share. The Board of Directors

is authorized to issue preferred stock in series, and with
    respect to each series, to fix its designation, relative rights
    (including voting, dividend, conversion, sinking fund, and
    redemption rights), preferences (including dividends and
    liquidation) and limitations. We have ten million shares of
    authorized preferred stock, $0.01 par value, none of which
    is currently outstanding.

Share
    Repurchases

In 2007, the maximum amount of capital allocated to our share
    repurchases and dividend payments by our Board of Directors was
    $2.1 billion. In 2008, our Board of Directors approved a
    capital allocation program that included the authorization for
    up to $1.4 billion in combined cash dividends and common
    stock repurchases. Additionally, $184 million of the
    capital allocated to share repurchases in 2007 remained
    available for 2008 repurchases. In July 2008, we suspended our
    share repurchases in connection with a proposed acquisition. In
    the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that, given the state
    of the economy and the financial markets, it would be prudent to
    suspend repurchases for the foreseeable future. As a result,
    share repurchases made during 2008 were significantly less than
    that which was authorized.

In June 2009, we decided that the improvement in the capital
    markets and the economic environment supported a decision to
    resume repurchases of our common stock during the second half of
    2009.

The following is a summary of activity under our stock
    repurchase programs for each year presented:

In December 2009, we entered into a plan under SEC

Rule 10b5-1

to effect market purchases of our common stock in 2010. These
    common stock repurchases were made in accordance with our Board
    approved capital allocation program. We repurchased $68 million
    of our common stock pursuant to the plan, which was completed on
    February 12, 2010.

Future share repurchases will be made within the limits approved
    by our Board of Directors at the discretion of management, and
    will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board
    in making dividend declarations.

Dividends

Our quarterly dividends have been declared by our Board of
    Directors and paid in accordance with the capital allocation
    programs discussed above. Cash dividends declared and paid were
    $569 million in 2009, or $1.16 per common share;
    $531 million in 2008, or $1.08 per common share; and
    $495 million in 2007, or $0.96 per common share.

In December 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors
    expects to increase the per share quarterly dividend from $0.29
    to $0.315 for dividends declared in 2010. However, all future
    dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net
    earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business
    plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which employees
    that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase
    shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for
    two offering periods for purchases: January through June and
    July through December. At the end of each offering period,
    employees are able



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85%
    of the lesser of the market value of the stock on the first and
    last day of such offering period. The purchases are made through
    payroll deductions, and the number of shares that may be
    purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The total number of
    shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in each of
    2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately 969,000, 839,000 and
    713,000, respectively. Including the impact of the January 2010
    issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2009
    offering period, approximately 2.5 million shares remain
    available for issuance under the plan.

Accounting for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan increased annual
    compensation expense by approximately $6 million, or
    $4 million net of tax, for both 2009 and 2008 and by
    approximately $5 million, or $3 million net of tax,
    for 2007.

Employee
    Stock Incentive Plans

Pursuant to our stock incentive plan, we have the ability to
    issue stock options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights,
    all on terms and conditions determined by the Management
    Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

The Company’s 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, which authorized
    the issuance of up to 34 million shares of our common
    stock, terminated by its terms in May 2009, at which time
    stockholders approved our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the
    2009 Plan, up to 26.2 million shares of our common stock
    are available for issuance. All of our stock-based compensation
    awards described herein have been made under either our 2004 or
    2009 Plan. We currently utilize treasury shares to meet the
    needs of our equity-based compensation programs under the 2009
    Plan and to settle outstanding awards granted pursuant to
    previous incentive plans.

During the three years ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company’s long-term incentive plan, or LTIP, has included
    an annual grant of restricted stock units and performance share
    units for key employees. Beginning in 2008, the annual LTIP
    grant made to the Company’s senior leadership team, which
    generally represents the Company’s executive officers, has
    been comprised solely of performance share units. During the
    reported periods, the Company has also granted restricted stock
    units to employees working on key initiatives; in connection
    with new hires and promotions; and to field-based managers.

    vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $13 million,
    $11 million and $14 million, respectively.

Restricted stock units provide award recipients with dividend
    equivalents during the vesting period, but the units may not be
    voted or sold until time-based vesting restrictions have lapsed.
    Restricted stock units provide for three-year cliff vesting.
    Unvested units are subject to forfeiture in the event of
    voluntary or for-cause termination.



WASTE

NOTES TO

Restricted stock units are subject to pro-rata vesting upon an
    employee’s retirement or involuntary termination other than
    for cause and become immediately vested in the event of an
    employee’s death or disability.

Compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is
    measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock
    and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required
    employment period, which is generally the vesting period.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    current period and historical forfeitures.

Performance Share Units —

Performance share
    units are payable in shares of common stock based on the
    achievement of certain financial measures, after the end of a
    three-year performance period. At the end of the three-year
    period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200%
    of the targeted amount. A summary of our performance share units

(a)

The units that vested in 2009 and 2008 were subject to
    three-year performance targets that were established when the
    awards were granted. The Company’s financial results for
    the three-year periods ended December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, as measured for purposes of these
    awards, were lower than the target levels established.
    Accordingly, in 2009, we issued approximately
    594,000 shares for vested units, or 94% of the established
    target and in 2008, we issued approximately 561,000 shares
    for vested units, or 91% of the established target. The
    Company’s performance exceeded the target level established
    for the awards that vested in 2007 and we issued approximately
    65,000 shares.

(b)

The shares issued upon the vesting of performance share units
    had a fair market value of $17 million in 2009,
    $19 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007.

Performance share units have no voting rights and dividend
    equivalents are paid out in cash based on actual performance at
    the end of the awards’ performance period. Performance
    share units are payable to an employee (or his beneficiary) upon
    death or disability as if that employee had remained employed
    until the end of the performance period, are subject to pro-rata
    vesting upon an employee’s retirement or involuntary
    termination other than for cause and are subject to forfeiture
    in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination.

Compensation expense associated with performance share units
    that continue to vest based on future performance is measured
    based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock.
    Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance
    period based on our estimated achievement of the established
    performance criteria. Compensation expense is only recognized
    for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based
    upon an assessment of both the probability that the performance
    criteria will be achieved and current period and historical
    forfeitures.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we
    recognized $22 million, $42 million and
    $31 million, respectively, of compensation expense
    associated with restricted stock unit and performance share unit
    awards as a component of “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. Our “Provision for income taxes” for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

related deferred income tax benefits of $9 million,
    $16 million and $12 million, respectively. We have not
    capitalized any equity-based compensation costs during the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Compensation expense recognized in 2009 was significantly less
    than expense recognized in prior years primarily due to the
    Company’s determination that it is no longer probable that
    the targets established for performance share units granted in
    2008 will be met. Accordingly, during the second quarter of
    2009, we recognized an adjustment to “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses for the reversal of all previously
    recognized compensation expense associated with this award. As
    of December 31, 2009, we estimate that a total of
    approximately $30 million of currently unrecognized
    compensation expense will be recognized in future periods for
    unvested restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards
    issued and outstanding. Our estimated unrecognized compensation
    expense is also lower in 2009 than in prior years as a result of
    our determination that it is no longer probable that the targets
    for performance share units granted in 2008 will be achieved.
    Unrecognized compensation expense associated with all unvested
    awards currently outstanding is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of approximately two years.

Stock Options —

Prior to 2005, stock options
    were the primary form of equity-based compensation we granted to

Non-Employee
    Director Plans

Our non-employee directors currently receive annual grants of
    shares of our common stock, payable in two equal installments,
    under the same stock incentive plans we use for employees’
    equity grants, described above. Prior to 2008, our directors
    received deferred stock units and were allowed to elect to defer
    a portion of their cash compensation in the form of deferred
    stock units, to be paid out in shares of our common stock at the
    termination of board service, pursuant to our
    2003 Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan. In late
    2007, each member of the Board of Directors elected to receive
    payment of shares for his deferred stock units at the end of
    December 2008 and recognized taxable income on such payment. The
    Board of Directors terminated the 2003 Directors’ Plan
    in 2009 and, as a result, no shares remain available for
    issuance under that plan.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Assets
    and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value

Authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements
    provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a
    fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure
    fair value, giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3 inputs).

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring
    the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data
    or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in
    pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk
    when appropriate. As

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are reflected at fair value in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements based upon quoted market prices and consist
    primarily of money market funds that invest in United States
    government obligations with original maturities of three months
    or less.

Available-for-Sale

Securities

Available for-sale securities are recorded at fair value based
    on quoted market prices. These assets include restricted trusts
    and escrow accounts invested in money market mutual funds,
    equity-based mutual funds and other equity securities. The cost
    basis of restricted trusts and escrow accounts invested in
    equity-based mutual funds and other equity securities was
    $77 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.
    Unrealized holding gains and losses on these instruments are
    recorded as either an increase or decrease to the asset balance
    and deferred as a component of “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” in the equity section of our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized holding gains on
    these instruments, net of taxes, were $2 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and the net unrealized holding losses on
    these instruments, net of taxes, were $2 million as of
    December 31, 2008. The fair value of our remaining

available-for-sale

securities approximates our cost basis in the investments.

Interest
    Rate Derivatives

As of December 31, 2009, we are party to

(i) fixed-to-floating

interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges of
    our currently outstanding senior notes;
    (ii) forward-starting interest rate swaps that are
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated interest payments
    for future fixed-rate debt issuances; and (iii) Treasury
    rate locks that are designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated interest payments of a future fixed-rate debt
    issuance. Our

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps are
    LIBOR based instruments. Accordingly, these derivatives are
    valued using a third-party pricing model that incorporates
    information about LIBOR yield curves for each instrument’s
    respective term. Our Treasury rate locks are valued using a
    third-party pricing model that incorporates information about
    the

on-the-run

10-year

U.S. Treasury yield curve. The third-party pricing model
    used to value our interest rate derivatives also incorporates
    Company and counterparty credit valuation adjustments, as
    appropriate. Counterparties to our interest rate derivatives are
    financial institutions who participate in our $2.4 billion
    revolving credit facility. Valuations of our interest rate
    derivatives may fluctuate significantly from

period-to-period

due to volatility in underlying interest rates, which are driven
    by market

conditions and the scheduled maturities of the derivatives.
    Refer to Note 8 for additional information regarding our
    interest rate derivatives.

Foreign
    Currency Derivatives

Our foreign currency derivatives are valued using forward
    Canadian dollar exchange prices at the reporting date.
    Counterparties to these contracts are financial institutions who
    participate in our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility.
    Valuations may fluctuate significantly from

period-to-period

due to volatility in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar
    exchange rate. Due to the short-term maturities of the
    Company’s foreign currency exchange derivatives,
    counterparty credit risk is not significant. Refer to
    Note 8 for additional information regarding our foreign
    currency derivatives.

Fair
    Value of Debt

At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of our debt was
    approximately $8.9 billion compared with $8.3 billion
    at December 31, 2008. The carrying value of our debt
    includes adjustments for both the unamortized fair value
    adjustments related to terminated hedge arrangements and fair
    value adjustments of debt instruments that are currently hedged.

The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately
    $9.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and approximately
    $7.7 billion at December 31, 2008. The estimated fair
    value of our senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The
    carrying value of remarketable debt approximates fair value due
    to the short-term nature of the attached interest rates. The
    fair value of our other debt is estimated using discounted cash
    flow analysis, based on rates we would currently pay for similar
    types of instruments. The increase in the fair value of our debt
    when comparing December 31, 2009 with December 31,
    2008 is primarily related to (i) an increase in outstanding
    debt balances; (ii) an increase in market prices for
    corporate debt securities due to a significant improvement in
    the condition of the credit markets as compared with late 2008,
    which caused a substantial increase in the fair value of our
    publicly-traded senior notes; and (iii) a significant
    decrease in current market rates on fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds.

Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts
    using available market information and commonly accepted
    valuation methodologies, considerable judgment is required in
    interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
    Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the
    amounts that we, or holders of the instruments, could realize in
    a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions

and/or

estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the
    estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on
    information available as of December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008. These amounts have not been revalued
    since those dates, and current estimates of fair value could
    differ significantly from the amounts presented.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

Acquisitions

We continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are
    accretive to our solid waste operations and enhance and expand
    our existing service offerings. We have seen the greatest
    opportunities for realizing superior returns from tuck-in
    acquisitions, which are primarily the purchases of collection
    operations that enhance our existing route structures and are
    strategically located near our existing disposal operations.

In 2009, we acquired businesses primarily related to our
    collection operations. Total consideration, net of cash
    acquired, for acquisitions was $336 million, which included
    $266 million in cash payments, a liability for additional
    cash payments with an estimated fair value of $46 million,
    and assumed liabilities of $24 million. The additional cash
    payments are contingent upon achievement by the acquired
    businesses of certain negotiated goals, which generally included
    targeted revenues. At the date of acquisition, our estimated
    obligations for the contingent cash payments were between
    $42 million and $56 million. As of December 31,
    2009, we had paid $15 million of this contingent
    consideration.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The allocation of purchase price was primarily to “Property
    and equipment,” which had an estimated fair value of
    $102 million; “Other intangible assets,” which
    had an estimated fair value of $105 million; and
    “Goodwill” of $125 million. Goodwill is a result
    of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses
    with our existing operations and is tax deductible.

Our 2009 acquisitions included the purchase of the remaining
    equity interest in one of our portable self-storage investments,
    increasing our equity interest in this entity from 50% to 100%.
    As a result of this acquisition, we recognized a $4 million
    loss for the remeasurement of the fair value of our initial
    equity investment, which was determined to be $5 million.
    This loss was recognized as a component of “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” in our Statement of Operations.

In 2008 and 2007, we completed several acquisitions for a cost,
    net of cash acquired, of $280 million and $90 million,
    respectively.

Divestitures

The aggregate sales price for divestitures of operations was
    $1 million in 2009, $59 million in 2008, and
    $224 million in 2007. The proceeds from these sales were
    comprised substantially of cash. We recognized net gains on
    these divestitures of $33 million in 2008, and
    $59 million in 2007. The impact to our 2009 income from
    operations of gains and losses on divestitures was less than
    $1 million. These divestitures were made as part of our
    initiative to improve or divest certain underperforming and
    non-strategic operations.

20.

Variable
    Interest Entities

Following is a description of our financial interests in
    variable interest entities that we consider significant,
    including (i) those for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary of the entity and, therefore, have
    consolidated the entity into our financial statements; and
    (ii) those that represent a significant interest in an
    unconsolidated entity. As disclosed in Note 24, we are in
    the process of assessing revised guidance from the FASB related
    to variable interest entities that is effective for the Company
    January 1, 2010.

Consolidated
    Variable Interest Entities

Waste-to-Energy

LLCs

— On June 30, 2000, two limited
    liability companies were established to purchase interests in
    existing leveraged lease financings at three

waste-to-energy

facilities that we lease, operate and maintain. We own a 0.5%
    interest in one of the LLCs (“LLC I”) and a 0.25%
    interest in the second LLC (“LLC II”). John Hancock
    Life Insurance Company owns 99.5% of LLC I and 99.75% of LLC II
    is owned by LLC I and the CIT Group. In 2000, Hancock and CIT
    made an initial investment of $167 million in the LLCs,
    which was used to purchase the three

waste-to-energy

facilities and assume the seller’s indebtedness. Under the
    LLC agreements, the LLCs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence
    of any of the following events: (i) a written decision of
    all members of the LLCs; (ii) December 31, 2063;
    (iii) a court’s dissolution of the LLCs; or
    (iv) the LLCs ceasing to own any interest in the

waste-to-energy

facilities.

Income, losses and cash flows of the LLCs are allocated to the
    members based on their initial capital account balances until
    Hancock and CIT achieve targeted returns; thereafter, we will
    receive 80% of the earnings of each of the LLCs and Hancock and
    CIT will be allocated the remaining 20% based on their
    respective equity interests. All capital allocations made
    through December 31, 2009 have been based on initial
    capital account balances as the target returns have not yet been
    achieved.

Our obligations associated with our interests in the LLCs are
    primarily related to the lease of the facilities. In addition to
    our minimum lease payment obligations, we are required to make
    cash payments to the LLCs for differences between fair market
    rents and our minimum lease payments. These payments are subject
    to adjustment based on factors that include the fair market
    value of rents for the facilities and lease payments made
    through the re-measurement dates. In addition, we may be
    required under certain circumstances to make capital
    contributions to



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the LLCs based on differences between the fair market value of
    the facilities and defined termination values as provided for by
    the underlying lease agreements, although we believe the
    likelihood of the occurrence of these circumstances is remote.

We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the LLCs
    because our interest in the entities is subject to variability
    based on changes in the fair market value of the leased
    facilities, while Hancock’s and CIT’s interests are
    structured to provide targeted returns based on their respective
    initial investments. As of December 31, 2009, our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $331 million of net
    property and equipment associated with the LLCs’

waste-to-energy

facilities and $234 million in noncontrolling interests
    associated with Hancock’s and CIT’s interests in the
    LLCs. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, we recognized noncontrolling interest expense of
    $50 million, $41 million and $35 million,
    respectively, for Hancock’s and CIT’s interests in the
    LLCs’ earnings, which are largely eliminated in WMI’s
    consolidation.

Trusts for Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation
    Obligations

— We have determined that we are the
    primary beneficiary of trust funds that were created to settle
    certain of our closure, post-closure or environmental
    remediation obligations. Although we are not always the sole
    beneficiary of these trust funds, we have determined that we are
    the primary beneficiary because we retain a majority of the
    risks and rewards associated with changes in the fair value of
    the assets held in trust. As the trust funds are expected to
    continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were
    established, we do not believe that there is any material
    exposure to loss associated with the trusts. The consolidation
    of these variable interest entities has not materially affected
    our financial position or results of operations.

Significant
    Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

Investments in Coal-Based Synthetic Fuel Production
    Facilities

— As discussed in Note 9, through
    December 31, 2007, we owned an interest in two coal-based
    synthetic fuel production facilities. Along with the other
    equity investors, we supported the operations of the entities in
    exchange for a pro-rata share of the tax credits generated by
    the facilities. Our obligation to support the facilities’
    operations was, therefore, limited to the tax benefit we
    received. We were not the primary beneficiary of either of these
    entities. As such, we accounted for these investments under the
    equity method of accounting and did not consolidate the
    facilities.

21.

Segment
    and Related Information

We currently manage and evaluate our operations primarily
    through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western and Wheelabrator
    Groups. These five Groups are presented below as our reportable
    segments. Our segments provide integrated waste management
    services consisting of collection, disposal (solid waste and
    hazardous waste landfills), transfer,

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants that are
    managed by Wheelabrator, recycling services and other services
    to commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The
    operations not managed through our five Groups are presented
    herein as “Other.”

As a result of the transfer of responsibility for the oversight
    of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities to the management teams of our
    geographic Groups, we also changed the way we review the
    financial results of our geographic Groups. Beginning in 2009,
    the financial results of our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities are included as a component of
    their respective geographic Group and the financial results of
    our recycling brokerage business and electronics recycling
    services are included as part of our “Other”
    operations. We have reflected the impact of these changes for
    all periods presented to provide financial information that
    consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
    geographic Group operations.

WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

From time to time, our operating results are significantly
    affected by unusual or infrequent transactions or events. The
    following significant and unusual items have affected the
    comparison of our operating results during the periods presented:

First
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a $10 million favorable adjustment to
    “Operating” expenses due to an increase from 2.25% to
    2.75% in the discount rate used to estimate the present value of
    our environmental remediation obligations. This reduction to
    “Operating” expenses resulted in a corresponding
    increase in “Net income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests” of $2 million. The discount rate adjustment
    increased the quarter’s “Net income attributable to
    Waste Management, Inc.” by $5 million, or $0.01 per
    diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by a non-cash
    charge of $49 million related to the abandonment of the SAP
    waste and recycling revenue management software, which reduced
    “Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Additionally, we
    recognized $38 million of charges related to our January
    2009 restructuring, which reduced “Net income attributable
    to Waste Management, Inc.” by $23 million, or $0.05
    per diluted share.

Second
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a $22 million favorable adjustment to
    “Operating” expenses due to an increase from 2.75% to
    3.50% in the discount rate used to estimate the present value of
    our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets.
    This reduction to “Operating” expenses resulted in a
    corresponding increase in “Net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests” of $6 million. Additionally,
    our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses
    were reduced by $8 million as a result of the reversal of
    all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008
    performance share units based on a determination that it is no
    longer probable that the targets established for that award will
    be met. These items increased the quarter’s “Net
    income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $15 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by (i) a
    $9 million charge to “Operating” expenses for a
    withdrawal of bargaining unit employees from an underfunded,
    multi-employer pension fund; (ii) $5 million of
    charges related to our January 2009 restructuring; and
    (iii) a $2 million impairment charge recognized by our
    Southern Group due to a change in expectations for the operating
    life of a landfill. These items decreased the quarter’s
    “Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $10 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Third
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    $3 million of charges related to our January 2009
    restructuring. This charge negatively affected “Net income
    attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” for the quarter by
    $2 million.

•

Our “Provision for income taxes” for the quarter was
    reduced by $19 million primarily as a result of the
    finalization of our 2008 tax returns and tax audit settlements,
    which positively affected “Diluted earnings per common
    share” by $0.04.

Fourth
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was positively affected by (i) an
    $18 million increase in the revenues of our Eastern Group
    for payments received under an oil and gas lease at one of our
    landfills; and (ii) a $22 million decrease to
    “Depreciation and amortization” expense for
    adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the timing and cost of future final capping, closure and
    post-closure of fully utilized airspace. These items increased
    the quarter’s “Net income attributable to Waste
    Management, Inc.” by $24 million, or $0.05 per diluted
    share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by (i) a
    $27 million impairment charge recognized by our Western
    Group as a result in a change in expectations for the future
    operations of an inactive landfill in California; (ii) a
    $12 million increase to “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses for several legal matters;
    (iii) a $4 million impairment charge required to
    write-down certain of our investments in portable self-storage
    operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of
    a controlling financial interest in those operations;
    (iv) $4 million of charges related to our January 2009
    restructuring; and (v) a $2 million impairment charge
    related to the abandonment of the SAP waste and recycling
    revenue management software. These items decreased the
    quarter’s “Net income attributable to Waste
    Management, Inc.” by $29 million, or $0.06 per diluted
    share.

•

Our “Provision for income taxes” for the quarter was
    reduced by $108 million as a result of (i) the
    liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, which generated a capital
    loss that could be utilized to offset capital gains generated in
    previous years; (ii) the utilization of state net operating
    loss and credit carry-forwards; and (iii) a reduction in
    provincial tax rates in Ontario, Canada, which resulted in the
    revaluation of related deferred tax balances. This significant
    decrease in taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 4.9% for
    the fourth quarter of 2009 and positively affected the
    quarter’s “Diluted earnings per common share” by
    $0.22.

First
    Quarter 2008

•

Net income was positively affected by a $6 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes”
    recognized as a result of the settlement of tax audits.

Second
    Quarter 2008

•

Net income was positively affected by (i) a $7 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes”
    recognized as a result of the settlement of tax audits; and
    (ii) a $10 million net reduction in “Interest
    expense,” or $6 million net of tax, for the immediate
    recognition of fair value adjustments associated with terminated
    interest rate swaps related to our $244 million of
    8.75% senior notes that were repaid in May 2008, but would
    have matured in 2018.

Third
    Quarter 2008

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a $23 million net credit to “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” due to $26 million of gains from divestitures
    of underperforming collection operations in our Southern Group,
    offset in part by a $3 million impairment charge recognized
    as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our Southern
    Group. These items positively affected net income for the period
    by $14 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    $26 million of increased “Operating” expenses due
    to a labor disruption associated with the renegotiation of a
    collective bargaining agreement in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the
    related agreement of the bargaining unit to withdraw from the
    Central States Pension Fund. These charges negatively affected
    net income for the period by $16 million, or $0.03 per
    diluted share.

Fourth
    Quarter 2008

•

Income from operations was positively affected by (i) a
    $6 million reduction in landfill amortization expenses
    associated with changes in our expectations for the timing and
    cost of future final capping, closure and post-closure of fully
    utilized airspace; and (ii) the recognition of a
    $5 million net credit to “(Income) expense from
    divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items” for the
    divestiture of operations, principally

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in our Midwest Group. These items positively affected net income
    for the period by $6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    (i) $24 million of increased “Operating”
    expenses due to labor disruptions associated with the
    renegotiation of various collective bargaining agreements and
    the related withdrawal of the bargaining units from
    multi-employer pension plans; and (ii) a $33 million
    charge to “Operating” expenses as a result of a
    decrease in the risk-free interest rate used to discount our
    environmental remediation liabilities. The charge to
    “Operating” expenses associated with the change in the
    discount rate used for our environmental remediation liabilities
    resulted in a $6 million decrease in net income
    attributable to noncontrolling interests during the period.
    Collectively, these items negatively affected net income for the
    period by $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share.

•

Net income was positively affected by a $13 million
    reduction in our “Provision for income taxes”
    recognized as a result of tax audit settlements.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

24.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements (Unaudited)

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

—
    In June 2009, the FASB issued revised authoritative guidance
    associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities.
    This revised guidance replaces the current quantitative-based
    assessment for determining which enterprise has a controlling
    interest in a variable interest entity with an approach that is
    now primarily qualitative. This qualitative approach focuses on
    identifying the enterprise that has (i) the power to direct
    the activities of the variable interest entity that can most
    significantly impact the entity’s performance; and
    (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the variable interest entity. This revised
    guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an
    enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
    entity rather than a reassessment only upon the occurrence of
    specific events. The new FASB-issued authoritative guidance
    associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities
    is effective for the Company January 1, 2010. The change in
    accounting may either be applied by recognizing a
    cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on the date of
    adoption or by retrospectively restating one or more years and
    recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
    as of the beginning of the earliest year restated. We are
    currently in the process of assessing the provisions of this
    revised guidance and have not determined whether the adoption
    will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

— In
    September 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance
    associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This
    amended guidance addresses the determination of when individual
    deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate
    units of accounting and modifies the manner in which transaction
    consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable
    deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance
    associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are
    effective for the Company January 1, 2011, although the
    FASB does permit early adoption of the guidance provided that it
    is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of
    adoption. The new accounting standard may be applied either
    retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to
    arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date
    of adoption. We are in the process of assessing the provisions
    of this new guidance and currently do not expect that the
    adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. However, our adoption of this guidance may
    significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future
    revenue arrangements to the extent they are material.



Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Effectiveness
    of Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed
    to ensure that information we are required to disclose in
    reports that we file or submit with the SEC is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified by the SEC. An evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
    of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
    as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
    to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
    disclosed by us in reports we file with the SEC is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    required by the SEC, and is accumulated and communicated to
    management including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
    timely decisions regarding disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s report on our internal control over financial
    reporting can be found in Item 8,

Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data,

of this report. The Independent
