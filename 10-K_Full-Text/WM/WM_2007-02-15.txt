Business.

General

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
    our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
    variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary. Waste Management, Inc. is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries. When
    the terms “the Company,” “we,”
    “us” or “our” are used in this document,
    those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
    subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When
    we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to the
    parent holding company.

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and

waste-to-energy

services. In providing these services, we actively pursue
    projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive
    difference for our environment, including recovering and
    processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into
    a renewable energy source. Our customers include commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste
    management companies, electric utilities and governmental
    entities. During 2006, none of our customers accounted for more
    than 1% of our operating revenue. We employed approximately
    48,000 people as of December 31, 2006.

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving five key
    stakeholders: our customers, our employees, the environment, the
    communities in which we work, and our shareholders. Our goals
    are:

•

To be the waste solutions provider of choice for customers;

•

To be a best place to work for employees;

•

To be a leader in promoting environmental stewardship;

•

To be a trusted and valued community partner; and

•

To maximize shareholder value.

WMI was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name
    “USA Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a
    Delaware company in 1995. In a 1998 merger, the Illinois-based
    waste services company formerly known as Waste Management, Inc.,
    became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI and changed its name to
    Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”).
    At the same time, our parent holding company changed its name
    from USA Waste Services to Waste Management, Inc. Like WMI,
    WM Holdings is a holding company and all operations are
    conducted by subsidiaries.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
    Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone
    number at that address is

(713) 512-6200.

Our website address is http://www.wm.com. Our annual reports on

Form 10-K,

quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q

and current reports on

are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as
    practicable after we file the reports with the SEC. Our stock is
    traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
    “WMI.”

Strategy

In 2006, we continued working on our long-term goals of
    improving our organization and maximizing returns to our
    shareholders by concentrating on operational excellence,
    profitability and growing our business. Our current strategies
    are based on four objectives: revenue growth through pricing;
    lowering operating and selling, general and administrative costs
    through process standardization and productivity improvements;
    improving our portfolio of business units through our “fix
    or seek exit” strategy; and generating strong and
    consistent cash flow from operations that can be returned to
    shareholders.



Revenue
    Growth

Our revenue growth through pricing excellence objective centers
    around attaining a return on invested capital that appropriately
    considers our cost of capital, the risks we take in our business
    and the value of our disposal assets. We have been using an
    increasingly more disciplined approach to pricing, where we
    carefully analyze our operations and make decisions based on
    market specific information. In addition, we are rolling out
    comprehensive fee programs that are designed to recover the
    costs we incur for items such as collection of past due
    balances, container deliveries and infrequent

pick-ups.

We
    believe our success in increasing internal revenue growth from
    yield is a direct result of our pricing objectives.

Cost
    Control

We remain committed to finding the best practices throughout our
    organization and standardizing those practices and processes
    throughout the Company. In 2006, we were able to reduce our
    operating expenses for the first time in several years,
    demonstrating the progress we are making on our operational
    excellence initiatives such as improving productivity, reducing
    fleet maintenance costs, standardizing operating practices, and
    improving safety, as well as our divestiture of under-performing
    operations, which is discussed below.

We also believe that we must make investments in our business
    that will provide for longer-term cost savings and efficiencies.
    During 2006, we have made significant investments in our
    information technology, our people and our pricing strategies.
    Certain costs associated with these investments have increased
    our selling, general and administrative costs, but are being
    incurred to provide long-term returns. The most noteworthy
    investment we made in 2006 relates to our new revenue management
    software. During the last year, we focused on tailoring this
    revenue management software to our business and processes so
    that, when implemented, it will provide our employees with the
    information resources they need to serve our customers more
    effectively and efficiently. This implementation process will
    continue to be a focus of our people in 2007.

Improve
    Operations through Divestitures, Acquisitions and
    Investments

In the third quarter of 2005, we announced that our Board of
    Directors had approved a plan to divest under-performing and
    non-strategic operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    divested operations representing annual gross revenues of over
    $235 million. The ultimate sale of any of the operations
    identified for divestiture is dependent on several factors,
    including identifying interested purchasers, negotiating the
    terms and conditions of the sales, and obtaining regulatory
    approvals. We believe that we have made significant progress in
    2006 in executing our “fix or seek exit” strategy.

In addition to our focus on divesting under-performing
    operations, we continue to look for acquisitions and other
    investments to improve our current operations’ performance
    and enhance and expand our services. In particular, we intend to
    make investments in our landfill

gas-to-energy

programs as well as other purchases that we believe will benefit
    future expansion efforts, all of which are complementary to our
    existing operations.

Return
    Value to Shareholders

We continue to use the cash that we generate not only to
    reinvest in our business, but also to return value to our
    shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividend
    payments. Our current, three-year capital allocation program
    authorizes up to $1.2 billion of combined stock repurchases
    and dividend payments for each of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Our Board
    of Directors approved an additional $350 million for stock
    repurchases in 2006. Accordingly, we repurchased over
    $1 billion of our common stock and paid dividends of
    $476 million in 2006. We recently announced that our Board
    of Directors expects that future quarterly dividend payments
    will be increased to $0.24 per share, although our Board of
    Directors must first declare each dividend payment. This will
    result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we
    expect to pay out as dividends for the fourth straight year.



Operations

General

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services to
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. Our core
    business includes collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and

waste-to-energy

services. We manage and evaluate our operations through six
    operating Groups, of which four are organized by geographic area
    and two are organized by function. The geographic Groups include
    our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, and the two
    functional Groups are our Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to-energy

services, and our Recycling Group. We also provide additional
    waste management services that are not managed through our six
    Groups. These services include

on-site

services, methane gas recovery and third-party

sub-contracted

and administrative services managed by our National Accounts and
    Upstream organizations, and are presented in this report as
    “Other.”

The table below shows the total revenues (in millions)
    contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2006. More information
    about our results of operations by reportable segment is
    included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and in the

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins
    with a vast waste collection network. Collection involves
    picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to
    a transfer station or disposal site. We generally provide
    collection services under two types of arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we
    have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the
    agreements are influenced by factors such as collection
    frequency, type of collection equipment furnished by us, type
    and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the
    disposal



facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general market
    factors. As part of the service, we provide steel containers to
    most of our customers to store their solid waste between

pick-up

dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs
    of our customers or restrictions of their communities and many
    are designed so that they can be lifted mechanically and either
    emptied into a truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a
    disposal site. By using these containers, we can service most of
    our commercial and industrial customers with trucks operated by
    only one employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract
    with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality or regional
    authority that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a
    portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises
    are typically for periods of one to five years. We also provide
    services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to
    households. The fees for residential collection are either paid
    by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or
    service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving
    the service.

Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories
    for solid waste in North America and we have the largest network
    of landfills in North America. Solid waste landfills are built
    and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties
    that limit the possibility of water pollution, and are operated
    under prescribed procedures. A landfill must be maintained to
    meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations. The
    operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes
    excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and
    compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other inert
    material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These
    operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary
    conditions, to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare
    the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes.

All solid waste management companies must have access to a
    disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. We believe it
    is usually preferable for our collection operations to use
    disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer
    to as internalization, rather than using third-party disposal
    facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize
    higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows.
    The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to
    as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including
    competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste
    deposited.

We also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the United
    States. Under federal environmental laws, the federal government
    (or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all
    hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills
    have obtained the required permits, although some can accept
    only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also
    comply with specialized operating standards. Only hazardous
    waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory
    requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In
    some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal.
    Generally, these treatments involve the separation or removal of
    solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that
    transform wastes into inert materials that are no longer
    hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed
    and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term
    containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility
    at which we isolate treated hazardous wastes in liquid form by
    injection into deep wells that have been drilled in rock
    formations far below the base of fresh water to a point that is
    separated by other substantial geological confining layers.

We owned or operated 277 solid waste and six hazardous waste
    landfills at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005.
    The landfills that we operate but do not own are generally
    operated under a lease agreement or an operating contract. The
    differences between the two arrangements usually relate to the
    owner of the landfill operating permit. Generally, with a lease
    agreement, the permit is in our name and we operate the landfill
    for its entire life, making payments to the lessor, who is
    generally a private landowner, based either on a percentage of
    revenue or a rate per ton of waste received. We are generally
    responsible for closure and post-closure requirements under our
    lease agreements. For operating contracts, the owner of the
    property, generally a municipality, usually owns the permit and
    we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the
    life of the landfill. The property owner is generally
    responsible for closure and post-closure obligations under our
    operating contracts.

Based on remaining permitted airspace (as defined within

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

) as of
    December 31, 2006 and projected annual disposal volumes,
    the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our
    owned or operated landfills is approximately 28 years. Many
    of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal
    capacity beyond



what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of
    permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and
    evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill
    based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining
    capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are
    currently seeking expansion permits at 62 of our landfills for
    which we consider expansions to be likely. Although no
    assurances can be made that all future expansions will be
    permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average
    remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is
    approximately 35 years when considering remaining permitted
    airspace, expansion airspace (as defined within

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

) and projected annual
    disposal volume. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste
    that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown

(a)

Changes in engineering estimates result in either changes to the
    available remaining landfill capacity in terms of volume or
    changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting
    the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates
    of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are
    reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of
    factors, including standard engineering techniques and
    site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste
    type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of
    years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, and
    anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or
    recirculation of landfill leachate. We continually focus on
    improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that
    include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit,
    optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing
    initial compaction through improved landfill equipment,
    operations and training.

(b)

In 2005, the amount of landfill capacity was reduced by
    approximately 46 million tons, or approximately 1%, to
    reflect cumulative corrections to align the lives of nine of our
    landfills for accounting purposes with the terms of the
    underlying contractual lease or operating agreements supporting
    their operations.



The number of landfills we own or operate segregated by their
    estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal
    volume as of December 31, 2006, was as follows:

(a)

We closed four landfills in 2006 and added four permitted
    landfills due to acquisitions. Our landfill count as of
    December 31, 2006 includes three landfills that were
    classified as held for sale for financial reporting purposes.
    One of these landfills was sold in January 2007.

(b)

These amounts include 2.0 million tons at December 31,
    2006 and 2.6 million tons at December 31, 2005 that
    were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial
    purposes and were generally redirected from the permitted
    airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are
    frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for
    composting and clean dirt for

on-site

construction projects.

When a landfill we own or operate (i) reaches its permitted
    waste capacity; (ii) is permanently capped and
    (iii) receives certification of closure from the applicable
    regulatory agency, management of the site, including for any
    remediation activities, is generally transferred to our closed
    sites management group. In addition to the 283 active landfills
    we managed at December 31, 2006, we also managed 187 closed
    landfills.

Transfer.

At December 31, 2006, we owned
    or operated 342 transfer stations in North America. We deposit
    waste at these stations, as do other third-party waste haulers.
    The solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the
    volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by
    transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is often critical to third-party
    haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in
    close proximity to their collection operations. Fees charged to
    third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type
    and volume or weight of the waste transferred, the distance to
    the disposal site and general market factors.

The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection
    operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain
    fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the
    disposal of the waste we collect. It allows us to manage costs
    associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks,
    railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than
    collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the
    disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated
    and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically
    located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations;
    and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer
    of the waste to one of our disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do not own are
    generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease
    property from third parties. There are some instances where
    transfer stations are operated under



contract, generally for municipalities. In most cases we own the
    permits and will be responsible for all of the regulatory
    requirements in accordance with the lease and operating
    agreements terms.

facilities and five independent power production plants
    (“IPPs”) that are located in the Northeast and in
    Florida, California and Washington.

At our

waste-to-energy

facilities, solid waste is burned at high temperatures in
    specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted
    into high-pressure steam, which is either sold or used to
    generate electricity. Our

waste-to-energy

facilities are capable of processing up to 24,000 tons of solid
    waste each day. In both 2006 and 2005, our

waste-to-energy

facilities received 7.8 million tons of solid waste, or
    approximately 21,300 tons per day.

Our IPPs convert various waste and conventional fuels into
    steam, which is either sold or used to generate electricity. The
    plants burn wood waste, anthracite coal waste (culm), tires,
    landfill gas and natural gas. These facilities are integral to
    the solid waste industry, disposing of urban wood, waste tires,
    railroad ties and utility poles. Our anthracite culm facility in
    Pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal
    mining operations from over half a century ago. Ash remaining
    after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by
    decades of coal mining.

Our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs sell steam to industrial and commercial
    users. Steam that is not sold is used to generate electricity
    for sale to electric utilities. Fees at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs are generally subject to the terms and
    conditions of long-term contracts. Interim adjustments to the
    prices for steam and electricity under these long-term contracts
    are made for changes in market conditions such as inflation,
    natural gas prices and other general market factors.

Recycling.

Our Recycling Group focuses on
    improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling
    programs within communities and industries. In addition to our
    Recycling Group, our four geographic operating Groups provide
    certain recycling services that are embedded within the
    Groups’ other operations and, therefore, not included
    within the Recycling Group’s financial results.

Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the
    waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition. Our
    recycling operations include the following:

Collection and materials processing

— Through
    our collection operations, we collect recyclable materials from
    residential, commercial and industrial customers and direct
    these materials to one of our material recovery facilities
    (“MRFs”) for processing. We operate 108 MRFs where
    paper, glass, metals, plastics and compost are recovered for
    resale. We also operate five secondary processing facilities
    where materials received from MRFs can be further processed into
    raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods.
    Specifically, material processing services include data
    destruction, automated color sorting, and construction and
    demolition processing.

Plastics and rubber materials recycling

— Using

state-of-the-art

sorting and processing technology, we process, inventory and
    sell plastic and rubber commodities making the recycling of such
    items more cost effective and convenient.

Electronics recycling services

— We provide an
    innovative, customized approach to recycling discarded
    computers, communications equipment, and other electronic
    equipment. Services include the collection, sorting and
    disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle
    all collected materials.

Commodities recycling

— We market and resell
    recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the
    marketing of recyclable commodities for our own facilities and
    for third parties by maintaining comprehensive service centers
    that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market
    demands and product quality.

During 2005 and 2006, we also provided glass recycling services.
    However, we divested of our glass recycling facilities in 2006
    as part of our continued focus on improving the profitability of
    our business.

Recycling fees are influenced by frequency of collection, type
    and volume or weight of the recyclable material, degree of
    processing required, the market value of the recovered material
    and other market factors.



Our Recycling Group purchases recyclable materials processed in
    our MRFs from various sources, including third parties and other
    operating subsidiaries of WMI. The cost per ton of material
    purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport
    the finished goods to our customers. The price our Recycling
    Group pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a
    “rebate” and is based upon the price we receive for
    sales of finished goods and local market conditions. As a
    result, higher commodity prices increase our revenues and
    increase the rebates we pay to our suppliers.

Other.

We provide

on-site

services, in which we outsource our employees to provide full
    service waste management to customers at their plants and other
    facilities through our Upstream division. Our vertically
    integrated waste management operations allow us to provide
    customers with full management of their waste, including
    identifying recycling opportunities, minimizing their waste,
    determining the most efficient means available for waste
    collection and transporting and disposing of their waste.

We also develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial
    use of landfill gas through our Waste Management Renewable
    Energy Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste
    decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill
    gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be
    gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel.
    The United States Environmental Protection Agency
    (“EPA”) endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy
    resource, in the same category as wind, solar and geothermal
    resources. We actively pursue landfill gas beneficial use
    projects and at December 31, 2006 we were producing
    commercial quantities of methane gas at 104 of our solid waste
    landfills. At 76 of these landfills, the processed gas is
    delivered to electricity generators. The electricity is then
    sold to public utilities, municipal utilities or power
    cooperatives. At 23 landfills, the gas is delivered by
    pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for
    fossil fuels in industrial processes such as steam boilers,
    cement kilns and utility plants. At five landfills, the landfill
    gas is processed to pipeline-quality natural gas and then sold
    to natural gas suppliers.

In addition, we rent and service portable restroom facilities to
    municipalities and commercial customers under the name
    Port-O-Let

®

,
    and provide street and parking lot sweeping services. From time
    to time, we are also contracted to construct waste facilities on
    behalf of third parties.

Competition

The solid waste industry is very competitive. Competition comes
    from a number of publicly held solid waste companies, private
    solid waste companies, large commercial and industrial companies
    handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and
    public and private

waste-to-energy

companies. We also have competition from municipalities and
    regional government authorities with respect to residential and
    commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills. The
    municipalities and regional governmental authorities are often
    able to offer lower direct charges to the customer for the same
    service by subsidizing the cost of the service through the use
    of tax revenues and tax-exempt financing. Generally, however,
    municipalities do not provide significant commercial and
    industrial collection or waste disposal.

We compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees,
    geographic location and quality of operations. Our ability to
    obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other
    companies own or operate their own landfills, to which they will
    send their waste. We compete for collection accounts primarily
    on the basis of price and quality of services. Operating costs,
    disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the
    geographic areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge
    are determined locally, and typically vary by the volume and
    weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of
    handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to
    final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the
    geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment
    furnished to the customer. We face intense competition based on
    quality of service and pricing. Under certain customer service
    contracts, our ability to increase our prices or pass on cost
    increases to our customers may be limited. From time to time,
    competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept
    lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or
    to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts.



Employees

At December 31, 2006 we had approximately
    48,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,600
    were employed in administrative and sales positions and the
    balance in operations. Approximately 12,500 of our employees are
    covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial
    Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial
    Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally
    require the contracting party to demonstrate financial
    responsibility for their obligations under the contract.
    Financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or
    retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits.
    Various forms of financial assurance are also required by
    regulatory agencies for estimated closure, post-closure and
    remedial obligations at many of our landfills. In addition,
    certain of our tax-exempt borrowings require us to hold funds in
    trust for the repayment of our interest and principal
    obligations.

We establish financial assurance in different ways including
    surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies, trust and
    escrow agreements and financial guarantees. The instrument
    decision is based on several factors; most importantly the
    jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and
    availability of credit capacity. The following table summarizes
    the various forms and dollar amounts (in millions) of financial
    assurance that we had outstanding as of December 31, 2006:

(a)

We use surety bonds and insurance policies issued by a
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, National Guaranty Insurance
    Company of Vermont, the sole business of which is to issue
    financial assurance to WMI and our subsidiaries. National
    Guaranty Insurance Company is authorized to write up to
    approximately $1.3 billion in surety bonds or insurance
    policies for our closure and post-closure requirements, waste
    collection contracts and other business related obligations.

(b)

We hold non-controlling financial interests in two entities that
    we use to obtain financial assurance. Our contractual agreements
    with these entities do not specifically limit the amounts of
    surety bonds or insurance that we may obtain, making our
    financial assurance under these agreements limited only by the
    guidelines and restrictions of surety and insurance regulations.



The assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be
    drawn and used to meet the obligations for which the trusts and
    escrows were established. Other than these permitted draws on
    funds, virtually no claims have been made against our financial
    assurance instruments in the past, and considering our current
    financial position, management does not expect there to be
    claims against these instruments that will have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. In an
    ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases
    and reductions in available capacity, we are continually
    evaluating various options to access cost-effective sources of
    financial assurance.

Insurance

We also carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including
    general liability, automobile liability, real and personal
    property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and
    officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and other
    coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure
    to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per
    incident deductible under the related insurance policy. Our
    general liability insurance program has a per incident
    deductible of $2.5 million and our workers’
    compensation and auto insurance programs each have per incident
    deductibles of $1 million. Effective January 1, 2007,
    we increased the per incident deductible for our workers’
    compensation insurance program to $1.5 million. We do not
    expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental
    or other contingency to be material to our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated insurance
    liabilities as of December 31, 2006 are summarized in
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state
    or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and
    transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
    are administered by the EPA and various other federal, state and
    local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health
    and safety agencies in the United States and various agencies in
    Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations
    to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have
    the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose
    civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.

Because the major component of our business is the collection
    and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner,
    a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related,
    either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection
    measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial
    and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials
    into the environment. There are costs associated with siting,
    design, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective
    actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and
    post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition,
    development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer
    station, we



must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain
    or maintain necessary required permits and approvals. There
    cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or
    maintain necessary governmental approvals. Once obtained,
    operating permits are subject to modification, suspension or
    revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with these and any
    future regulatory requirements could require us to make
    significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of
    these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and
    do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.

The primary United States federal statutes affecting our
    business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended
    (“RCRA”), regulates handling, transporting and
    disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and delegates
    authority to states to develop programs to ensure the safe
    disposal of solid wastes. In 1991, the EPA issued its final
    regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA, which set forth minimum
    federal performance and design criteria for solid waste
    landfills. These regulations must be implemented by the states,
    although states can impose requirements that are more stringent
    than the Subtitle D standards. We incur costs in complying with
    these standards in the ordinary course of our operations.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), which is
    also known as Superfund, provides for federal authority to
    respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous
    substances into the environment that have created actual or
    potential environmental hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for
    addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for
    cleanup of disposal sites upon current and former site owners
    and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the
    site and transporters who selected the disposal site and
    transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not
    dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous substances;
    it can be based upon the release or threatened release, even as
    a result of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of
    hazardous substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other
    applicable statutes and regulations. Liability may include
    contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a
    CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved
    its liability to federal or state regulators in an
    administrative or judicially approved settlement. Liability may
    also include damage to publicly owned natural resources. We are
    subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or
    operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been
    disposed or as a generator or transporter of hazardous
    substances disposed of at other locations.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the “Clean
    Water Act”) regulates the discharge of pollutants into
    streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a
    variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites. If
    run-off from our operations may be discharged into surface
    waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain
    discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under
    certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in
    those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards
    for management of storm water runoff from landfills that require
    landfills to obtain storm water discharge permits. In addition,
    if a landfill or a transfer station discharges wastewater
    through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works, the
    facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the
    treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a
    landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may
    have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement
    wetlands. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and
    administrative penalties for violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased
    federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air
    pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the
    requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal
    solid waste landfills and large municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities. Standards have also been imposed on manufacturers of
    transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles).
    In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards and
    emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and
    existing large landfills. The regulations impose limits on air
    emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject
    most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain
    operating permitting requirements under Title V of the
    Clean Air Act, and, in many instances, require installation of
    landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions
    or to treat and utilize landfill gas on or off-site. In general,
    controlling emissions involves drilling collection wells into a
    landfill and routing the gas to a



suitable energy recovery system or combustion device. We are
    currently capturing and utilizing the renewable energy value of
    landfill gas at 104 of our solid waste landfills. In January
    2003, the EPA issued additional regulations that required
    affected landfills to prepare, by January 2004, startup,
    shutdown and malfunction plans to ensure proper operation of gas
    collection, control and treatment systems.

The EPA has issued new source performance standards and emission
    guidelines for large and small municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities, which include stringent emission limits for various
    pollutants based on Maximum Achievable Control Technology
    (“MACT”) standards. These sources are also subject to
    operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean
    Air Act. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise
    the MACT standards applicable to municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities every five years.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended,
    establishes certain employer responsibilities, including
    maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to
    cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards
    promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    (“OSHA”), and various record keeping, disclosure and
    procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of
    hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the
    handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The
    Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal
    agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects pertaining to
    safety, movement of hazardous materials, movement and disposal
    of hazardous waste and equipment standards. Various state and
    local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous
    waste and may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials
    in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations
    that affect our operations. Sometimes states’ regulations
    are stricter than comparable federal laws and regulations when
    not otherwise preempted by federal law. Additionally, our
    collection and landfill operations could be affected by
    legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging
    waste reduction at the source and waste recycling.

Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws
    that restrict the disposal, within the state, of solid waste
    generated outside the state. While laws that overtly
    discriminate against

out-of-state

waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are
    less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court.
    Additionally, certain state and local governments have enacted
    “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require
    that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction
    be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the United States
    Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance was
    unconstitutional. However, other courts have refused to apply
    the Supreme Court precedent in various circumstances. In
    addition, from time to time, the United States Congress has
    considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations,
    restrictions, or taxes on the importation of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste. These congressional efforts have to date been
    unsuccessful. The United States Congress’ adoption of
    legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation
    of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste or certain types of flow control, the adoption of
    legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the
    state level, or the courts’ interpretation or validation of
    flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid waste
    management services.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted
    “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have
    jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or
    revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or
    permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces
    and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance
    history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in
    addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize
    the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit
    holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and
    to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness,
    unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder
    has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating
    policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance
    with applicable laws and regulations.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for
    disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of
    regulations on our current and future operations.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In an effort to keep our shareholders and the public informed
    about our business, we may make “forward-looking
    statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to
    future events and anticipated revenues, earnings,



cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating
    results. Forward-looking statements generally include statements
    containing:

•

projections about accounting and finances;

•

plans and objectives for the future;

•

projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our
    performance; and

•

our opinions, views or beliefs about current or future events,
    circumstances or performance.

You should view these statements with caution. These statements
    are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or
    events. They are based on the facts and circumstances known to
    us as of the date the statements are made. All phases of our
    business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other
    influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these
    factors, either alone or taken together, could have a material
    adverse effect on us and could change whether any
    forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true.
    Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any
    forward-looking statement as a result of future events,
    circumstances or developments. The following discussion should
    be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    the notes thereto. Outlined below are some of the risks that we
    face and that could affect our business and financial statement
    for 2007 and beyond. However, they are not the only risks that
    we face. There may be other risks that we do not presently know
    or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also
    impair our business or financial position.

The
    waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot
    successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial
    condition and operating results may be materially adversely
    affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental,
    quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our
    operations. In North America, the industry consists of large
    national waste management companies, and local and regional
    companies of varying sizes and financial resources. We compete
    with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities
    that maintain their own waste collection and disposal
    operations. These counties and municipalities may have financial
    competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to
    them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them.
    Also, such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control
    or other restrictions that would give them a competitive
    advantage.

In addition, competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales
    volume or to win competitively bid contracts. When this happens,
    we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or
    retain our customers, resulting in a negative impact to our
    revenue growth from yield on base business.

If we
    do not successfully manage our costs, our income from operations
    could be lower than expected.

In recent years, we have implemented several profit improvement
    initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our
    revenues, and we continue to seek ways to reduce our selling,
    general and administrative and operating expenses. While
    generally we have been successful in managing our selling,
    general and administrative costs, subcontractor costs and the
    effect of fuel price increases, our initiatives may not be
    sufficient. Even as our revenues increase, if we are unable to
    control variable costs or increases to our fixed costs in the
    future, we will be unable to maintain or expand our margins.

We
    cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement
    our plans and strategies to improve margins and increase our
    income from operations.

We have announced several programs and strategies that we have
    implemented or planned to improve our margins and operating
    results. For example, except when prohibited by contract, we
    have implemented price increases and environmental fees, and we
    continue our fuel surcharge programs, all of which have
    increased our internal revenue growth. The loss of volumes as a
    result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows
    or results of operations. Additionally, we have announced plans
    to divest under-performing and non-strategic assets if we cannot
    improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully
    negotiate the divestiture of under-performing and non-strategic
    operations, which could result in asset impairments or the
    continued operation of low-



margin businesses. If we are not able to fully implement our
    plans for any reason, many of which are out of our control, we
    may not see the expected improvements in our income from
    operations or our operating margins.

The
    seasonal nature of our business and changes in general and local
    economic conditions cause our quarterly results to fluctuate,
    and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our
    future results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the warmer
    months of the year, primarily due to the higher volume of
    construction and demolition waste in those months. The volumes
    of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we
    operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our
    second and third quarter revenues and results of operations
    typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, the storm
    conditions during hurricane season, which is generally June
    through November, can increase our revenues in the areas
    affected. However, for several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, storm-related revenue often generates comparatively lower
    margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we perform scheduled maintenance at
    our

waste-to-energy

facilities in the slower winter months, when electrical demand
    is generally lower.

Our business is affected by changes in national and general
    economic factors that are also outside of our control, including
    interest rates and consumer confidence. We have
    $3.0 billion of debt as of December 31, 2006 that is
    exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the
    combined impact of our variable rate tax-exempt bonds and our
    interest rate swap agreements. Therefore, any increase in
    interest rates can significantly increase our expenses.
    Additionally, although our services are of an essential nature,
    a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of
    waste generated, which decreases our revenues. We also face
    risks related to other adverse external factors, such as the
    ability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely
    manner and the effect that significant claims or litigation
    against insurance companies may have on such ability.

Any of the factors described above could materially adversely
    affect our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally,
    due to these and other factors, operating results in any interim
    period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
    an entire year, and operating results for any historical period
    are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future
    period.

We
    cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under
    environmental, health and safety laws, and cannot guarantee that
    they will not be material.

We could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage
    to our properties or to the property of other landowners,
    particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking
    water or soil. Under current law, we could even be held liable
    for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
    the assets or operations involved. Also, we could be liable if
    we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of
    hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or
    if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under
    applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner.
    Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, and
    may in the future, become involved in a variety of legal and
    administrative proceedings relating to land use and
    environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in
    which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to
    impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes
    involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to
    revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and

•

local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or
    governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or
    approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which
    we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or
    seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons
    involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If
    we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of
    these proceedings could result in, among other things, material
    increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material
    charges for asset impairments.



The
    waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation,
    and existing or future regulations, may restrict our operations,
    increase our costs of operations or require us to make
    additional capital expenditures.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
    provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have
    a substantial impact on our business. A large number of complex
    laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental
    protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and
    related matters. Among other things, they may restrict our
    operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

•

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal,
    transfer or processing facilities or expanding existing
    facilities;

•

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal
    prices, rates and volumes;

•

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of

out-of-state

waste or certain categories of waste; or

•

mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of
    landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or
    remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills
    temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations
    may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or
    facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could
    be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste
    management facility, we must have various facility permits and
    other governmental approvals, including those relating to
    zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and
    approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to
    obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

Significant
    shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will
    increase our operating expenses and price increases may also
    increase our tax expense.

The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable, and can
    fluctuate significantly based on international, political and
    economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our
    control, such as actions by OPEC and other oil and gas
    producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and
    environmental concerns. In the past two years, the

year-over-year

changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have ranged from an
    increase of 40% to a decrease of 5%. We need fuel to run our
    collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our
    landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially
    increase our operating expenses. Additionally, as fuel prices
    increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our
    vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising
    costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to
    offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to
    pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’
    contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs. We
    may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising
    costs of fuel, although there can be no assurances that we will
    be able to do so or that such programs will be successful.
    Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, the increased
    operating costs will decrease our operating margins.

Additionally, our effective tax rate through 2007 is expected to
    be significantly lower than statutory tax rates due in part to
    Section 45K (formerly Section 29) tax credits we
    realize from our landfill gas sales and investments in
    coal-based synthetic fuel partnerships. The ability to earn
    Section 45K tax credits is tied to an average benchmark oil
    price determined by the Internal Revenue Service, and the
    credits are phased out as the benchmark average price increases.
    Higher crude oil prices will phase out our credits and increase
    our effective tax rate, which will result in higher tax expense.

We
    have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements,
    and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
    assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could
    negatively impact our liquidity and increase our
    liabilities.

The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for
    environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements.
    We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to
    the coverage it would provide, and



therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum
    statutorily required levels. We face the risk of incurring
    liabilities for environmental damage if our insurance coverage
    is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a
    broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a
    company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of
    loss, thereby allowing us to manage our self-insurance exposure
    associated with claims. To the extent our insurers were unable
    to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims
    were more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse
    effect to our financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with
    respect to environmental closure and post-closure liabilities,
    we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on
    insurance, including captive insurance, or fund trust and escrow
    accounts. We currently have in place all financial assurance
    instruments necessary for our operations. We do not anticipate
    any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance
    instruments in the future. However, in the event we are unable
    to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or
    third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or
    more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate
    coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial
    assurance. These types of financial assurance could be more
    expensive to obtain, which could negatively impact our liquidity
    and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as
    they become due.

The
    possibility of development and expansion projects or pending
    acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could
    result in a material charge against our earnings.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we
    capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to
    disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions,
    software development costs and other projects. If a facility or
    operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired,
    a pending acquisition is not completed, a development or
    expansion project is not completed or is determined to be
    impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized
    capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility,
    acquisition or project. We reduce the charge against earnings by
    any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be
    recoverable, through sale or otherwise.

In future periods, we may be required to incur charges against
    earnings in accordance with this policy, or due to other events
    that cause impairments. Any such charges could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our
    revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity
    prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable
    materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which
    are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The
    majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper
    fibers, including old corrugated cardboard (“OCC”),
    and old newsprint (“ONP”). We enter into commodity
    price derivatives in an effort to mitigate some of the
    variability in cash flows from the sales of recyclable materials
    at floating market prices. In the past three years, the

year-over-year

changes in the quarterly average market prices for OCC ranged
    from a decrease of as much as 33% to an increase of as much as
    36%. The same comparisons for ONP have ranged from a decrease of
    as much as 15% to an increase of as much as 29%. These
    fluctuations can affect future operating income and cash flows.
    Additionally, our recycling operations offer rebates to
    suppliers, based on the market prices of commodities we buy to
    process for resale. Therefore, even if we experience higher
    revenues based on increased market prices for commodities, the
    rebates we pay will also increase.

Additionally, there may be significant price fluctuations in the
    price of methane gas, electricity and other energy related
    products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas
    recovery,

waste-to-energy

and independent power production plant operations. The marketing
    and sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and

waste-to-energy

operations are generally pursuant to long-term sales agreements.
    Therefore, market fluctuations do not have a significant effect
    on these operations in the short-term. However, as those
    agreements expire and are up for renewal, changes in market
    prices may affect our revenues. Additionally, revenues from our
    independent power production plants can be affected by price
    fluctuations. In the past two years, the

year-over-year

changes in the average quarterly electricity prices have
    increased as much as 12%.



The
    development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal
    and

waste-to-energy

facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full
    capacity.

Our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill
    and

waste-to-energy

disposal, such as recycling and composting. In addition, some
    state and local governments mandate recycling and waste
    reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain
    types of wastes, such as yard wastes, at landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities. Although such mandates are a useful tool to protect
    our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste
    going to landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities in certain areas, which may affect our ability to
    operate our landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities at full capacity, as well as the prices that we can
    charge for landfill disposal and

waste-to-energy

services.

Efforts
    by labor unions to organize our employees could increase our
    operating expenses.

Labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees,
    and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain
    groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by
    unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements
    with some of the groups. Additional groups of employees may seek
    union representation in the future, and, if successful, the
    negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert
    management attention and result in increased operating expenses
    and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable
    collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages, including
    strikes, could ensue. Depending on the type and duration of any
    labor disruptions, our operating expenses could increase
    significantly, which could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of
    our business and from

time-to-time

are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct
    of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these
    types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible
    outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse
    judgments or settlements, either of which could require
    substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.

We are
    increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if
    our technology fails, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We may experience problems with either the operation of our
    current information technology systems or the development and
    deployment of new information technology systems that could
    adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion
    of our operations until resolved. We have purchased and
    developed a new revenue management system and are piloting the
    system in the first half of 2007, with additional implementation
    to occur in late 2007 and early 2008. We may encounter problems
    in the development or deployment of this system that could
    result in significant errors in, or disruption of, our billing
    processes. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our
    ability to timely collect and report financial results in
    accordance with applicable law and regulations.

We may
    experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations
    as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
    interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting
    rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could
    adversely affect our reported operating results or cause
    unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in
    future periods.

Unforeseen
    circumstances could result in a need for additional
    capital.

We currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for
    capital expenditures, acquisitions and other cash expenditures
    with our cash flows from operations and, to the extent
    necessary, additional financings. However, materially adverse
    events could reduce our cash flows from operations. Our Board of
    Directors has approved a capital allocation program that
    provides for up to $1.2 billion in aggregate dividend
    payments and share repurchases during 2007 and recently
    announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments,
    when declared by the Board of Directors, to be $0.24 per
    share. If our cash flows from operations were negatively
    affected, we could be forced to



reduce capital expenditures, acquisition activity, share
    repurchase activity or dividend declarations. In these
    circumstances we instead may elect to incur more indebtedness.
    If we made such an election, there can be no assurances that we
    would be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable
    terms. In these circumstances, we would likely use our revolving
    credit facility to meet our cash needs.

In the event of a default under our credit facility, we could be
    required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and
    make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the
    facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally,
    any such default could cause a default under many of our other
    credit agreements and debt instruments. Any such default would
    have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we
    lease approximately 390,000 square feet under leases
    expiring at various times through 2010. Our operating Group
    offices are in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Georgia, Arizona, New
    Hampshire and Texas. We also have field-based administrative
    offices in Arizona, Illinois and Canada. We own or lease real
    property in most locations where we have operations. We have
    operations in each of the fifty states other than Montana and
    Wyoming. We also have operations in the District of Columbia,
    Puerto Rico and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment consist of land (primarily
    landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and
    bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and
    equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and
    operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient
    for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to
    make investments in additional equipment and property for
    expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with
    future acquisitions. For more information, see

In October 2004, the Company announced that its Board of
    Directors approved a capital allocation program authorizing up
    to $1.2 billion of stock repurchases and dividend payments
    annually for each of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Under this program, we
    paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per share each
    quarter in 2005 for a total of $449 million. We paid
    quarterly dividends in 2006 of $0.22 per common share for a
    total of $476 million.

In June 2006, our Board of Directors approved up to
    $350 million of additional share repurchases for 2006,
    increasing the amount of capital authorized for our share
    repurchases and dividends for 2006 to $1.55 billion. In
    2006, we repurchased approximately 31 million shares of our
    common stock for $1,072 million. All of the repurchases
    were made pursuant to our capital allocation program. The

(b)

For each period presented, the maximum dollar value of shares
    that may yet be purchased under the program has been provided as
    of the end of such period. As discussed above, the amount of
    capital available for share repurchases during 2006 was
    $1.55 billion, net of dividends paid. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we paid $476 million in dividends.
    The maximum dollar value of shares that may be purchased under
    the program included in the table above includes the effect of
    these dividend payments as if all payments had been made at the
    beginning of the earliest period presented. The
    “Total” amount available for repurchases under the
    plan is shown as zero because our capital allocation program, by
    its terms, provided for $1.55 billion in dividends and
    share repurchases in 2006, which makes any unexpended portion of
    the $1.55 billion unavailable after the end of the year.

In 2005, we repurchased 24.7 million shares of our common
    stock for $706 million, all of which was made pursuant to
    the capital allocation program discussed above.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our operations for the
    three years ended December 31, 2006. This discussion may
    contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based
    on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We
    discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual
    results to differ from expectations in Item 1A,

Risk
    Factors.

The following discussion should be read
    in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Overview

Significant financial achievements during the year ended
    December 31, 2006 include:

•

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $2.54 billion and free cash flow increased to
    $1.45 billion, increases of 6.2% and 3.3%, respectively,
    when compared with 2005;

•

Internal revenue growth of 2.7% in 2006, driven by the 3.6%
    increase in yield on base business, which is the highest base
    business yield increase we have had in at least six years;

•

Improvement in our operating expenses as a percentage of
    revenue, which decreased by 1.7 percentage points from
    66.0% of revenue in 2005 to 64.3% of revenue in 2006; and

•

Nearly $1.1 billion in share repurchases and
    $476 million in dividends paid pursuant to our capital
    allocation plan.

Free Cash Flow

— Free cash flow is a non-GAAP
    measure of financial performance that we include in our
    disclosures because we believe the production of free cash flow
    is an important measure of our liquidity and performance and
    because we believe our investors are interested in the cash we
    produce from non-financing activities that is available for
    acquisitions, share repurchases, scheduled debt repayments and
    the payment of



dividends. The most comparable GAAP financial measure to free
    cash flow is “Net cash provided by operating
    activities.” We calculate free cash flow as shown in the
    table below (in millions):

The growth in our 2006 operating and free cash flow reflects the
    current year improvements in our operating results, particularly
    those contributed by our increase in revenue from yield, which
    is discussed below.

Revenue Growth

— Our revenues for the year
    increased over 2%, from $13,074 million in 2005 to
    $13,363 million in 2006. The overall increase was largely a
    result of internal revenue growth, or IRG. IRG is an important
    indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability
    to increase revenues from our existing operations. Our IRG for
    the year was 2.7% and consisted primarily of improvement in
    yield on base business and an increase in revenues related to
    our fuel surcharge program. Our revenue growth from improved
    yield on base business for 2006 was 3.6%, which is an increase
    of 0.9 percentage points from the prior year. In addition,
    our fuel surcharge program contributed $117 million to
    revenue growth in 2006 compared with $157 million in 2005.
    The revenues generated by the program in 2006 recovered the
    increase in our operating costs attributable to fuel. The
    increases in revenue from improved yield on base business and
    our fuel surcharge program were partially offset by decreased
    revenues due to lower volumes. Additionally, the positive effect
    IRG had on overall revenue growth was offset by divestitures
    during the year. We have divested of under-performing
    operations, which resulted in lower revenues in the year.
    Although we continue to seek appropriate acquisitions, in 2006
    we lost more revenue as a result of divestitures than we gained
    from acquisitions. As discussed below, we believe that the
    negative impact divestitures had on revenues resulted in
    improvements in our operating margins.

Margin Improvement

— In 2006, our income from
    operations improved by $319 million, or 18.7%, as compared
    with 2005. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues
    was 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared
    with 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Several
    items that negatively affected our 2005 results and are not part
    of our ongoing operations significantly impact the comparability
    of our 2006 and 2005 operating results. When focusing on our
    core operating costs (which are Operating; Selling, general and
    administrative; and Depreciation and amortization expenses) as a
    percentage of revenues, our margin improvement was considerable,
    increasing 1.6 percentage points from 13.8% in 2005 to
    15.4% in 2006. The

year-over-year

decrease in our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is
    largely a result of our increased revenue provided by base
    business yield, but is also due to the success of our cost
    control initiatives, which have focused on improving
    productivity and standardizing our practices, and the
    divestitures of under-performing operations. Our selling,
    general and administrative expenses in 2006 increased by
    $112 million, and as a percentage of revenue increased by
    0.6 percentage points to 10.4%. The increase in selling,
    general and administrative expenses is due largely to higher
    bonus expense as a result of the significant improvement in the
    Company’s performance, non-capitalizable costs incurred to
    support the development of our revenue management system and a
    $20 million charge to record estimated unrecorded
    obligations associated with unclaimed property audits.

2007 Objectives

— In 2007, we will continue to
    pursue our goal of improving our profitability by focusing on
    revenue growth through pricing, eliminating our less profitable
    work, lowering our operating expenses, managing our selling,
    general and administrative expenses and generating strong and
    consistent cash flows that can be returned to our shareholders.

Late in 2006, we began to see a decline in our revenue growth
    due to decreases in volumes. We believe that this decline can be
    attributed to our pricing strategy and an economic softening in
    certain lines of our business in certain parts of the country.
    Even when considering these volume declines, which may continue
    in 2007, we have seen that our focus on increasing revenue
    through yield and shedding our less profitable volumes has been
    positive for our



operating margins and our cash flows. As we consider the
    continuing effects of this approach on our business, we will
    continue to focus on our stated long-term strategy of seeking
    operational excellence and improving profitability, divesting
    under-performing and non-strategic operations and seeking
    acquisition and investment candidates, such as landfill

gas-to-energy

projects, that we believe will offer superior margins and
    returns on capital.

Basis
    of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial
    Information

Accounting Change

— On January 1, 2006, we
    adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which
    requires compensation expense to be recognized for all
    share-based payments made to employees based on the fair value
    of the award at the date of grant. We adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method,
    which results in (i) the recognition of compensation
    expense using the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) for
    all share-based awards granted or modified after
    December 31, 2005 and (ii) the recognition of
    compensation expense using the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”) for all
    unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption.

Through December 31, 2005, as permitted by
    SFAS No. 123, we accounted for equity-based
    compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees

, as amended (“APB
    No. 25”). Under APB No. 25, we recognized
    compensation expense based on an award’s intrinsic value.
    For stock options, which were the primary form of awards we
    granted through December 31, 2004, this meant that we
    recognized no compensation expense in connection with the
    grants, as the exercise price of the options was equal to the
    fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and
    all other provisions were fixed. As discussed below, beginning
    in 2005, restricted stock units and performance share units
    became the primary form of equity-based compensation awarded
    under our long-term incentive plans. For restricted stock units,
    intrinsic value is equal to the market value of our common stock
    on the date of grant. For performance share units, APB
    No. 25 required “variable accounting,” which
    resulted in the recognition of compensation expense based on the
    intrinsic value of each award at the end of each reporting
    period until such time that the number of shares to be issued
    and all other provisions are fixed.

In December 2005, the Management Development and Compensation
    Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of
    the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our
    stock incentive plans, effective December 28, 2005. The
    decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options
    was made primarily to reduce the non-cash compensation expense
    that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a
    result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). We estimated that
    the acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of
    cumulative pre-tax compensation charges that would have been
    recognized during 2006, 2007 and 2008 as the stock options would
    have continued to vest. We recognized a $2 million pre-tax
    charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005
    as a result of the acceleration, but do not expect to recognize
    future compensation expense for the accelerated options under
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Additionally, as a result of changes in accounting required by
    SFAS No. 123(R) and a desire to design our long-term
    incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to
    operating and market performance, the Management Development and
    Compensation Committee approved a substantial change in the form
    of awards that we grant. Beginning in 2005, annual stock option
    grants were replaced with either (i) grants of restricted
    stock units and performance share units or (ii) an enhanced
    cash compensation award. Stock option grants in connection with
    new hires and promotions were replaced with grants of restricted
    stock units. The terms of restricted stock units and performance
    share units granted during 2006 are summarized in Note 15
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result of the acceleration of the vesting of stock options
    and the replacement of future awards of stock options with other
    forms of equity awards, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 did not
    significantly affect our accounting for equity-based
    compensation or net income for the year ended December 31,
    2006. We do not currently expect this change in accounting to
    significantly impact our future results of operations. However,
    we do expect equity-based compensation expense to increase over
    the next three years because of the incremental expense that
    will be recognized each year as additional awards are granted.

Reconsideration of a Variable Interest

— During
    2006, the debt of a previously consolidated variable interest
    entity was refinanced. As a result of the refinancing, our
    guarantee arrangement was also renegotiated, significantly
    reducing the value of our guarantee. We determined that the
    refinancing of the entity’s debt obligations and



corresponding renegotiation of our guarantee represented
    significant changes in the entity that required reconsideration
    of the applicability of FIN 46(R). As a result of the
    reconsideration of our interest in this variable interest
    entity, we concluded that we are no longer the primary
    beneficiary of this entity. Accordingly, in April 2006, we
    deconsolidated the entity. The deconsolidation of this entity
    did not materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for the periods presented.

Certain reclassifications have also been made in the
    accompanying financial statements to conform prior year
    information with the current period presentation. The
    supplementary financial information included in this section has
    been updated to reflect these changes.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates
    and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition
    and disclosure of our assets, liabilities, stockholders’
    equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and
    assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent
    on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of
    precision from data available or simply cannot be readily
    calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some
    cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine
    and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our
    financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex
    estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount
    of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
    environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and
    self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described below.
    Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and
    assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial
    statements.

Landfills

— The cost estimates for final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for
    which we have responsibility are estimated based on our
    interpretations of current requirements and proposed or
    anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional
    costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143,
    based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform
    such activities even when we expect to perform these activities
    internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to
    each final capping event and the timing of each final capping
    event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because
    landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are
    measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques,
    changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping
    and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on
    these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.

Landfill Costs —

We estimate the total cost to
    develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as
    landfill liner material and installation, excavation for
    airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest,

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs.
    Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases
    for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property.
    The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on
    future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill
    includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and
    capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and
    projections of future purchase and development costs.

Final Capping Costs —

We estimate the cost for
    each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped
    and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates
    also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor
    in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel
    allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping
    events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping
    event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each
    event are amortized over the related capacity associated with
    the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review
    these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change.
    Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction,
    for final capping events immediately impact the required
    liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in
    estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to
    the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When
    the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has
    not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is
    recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill
    airspace amortization.



Closure and Post-Closure Costs —

We base our
    estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our
    interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for
    closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The
    estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also
    consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in
    inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal
    and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of
    these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less
    certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure
    events immediately impact the required liability and the
    corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a
    fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be
    amortized immediately through expense. When the change in
    estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully
    consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income
    prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Remaining Permitted Airspace —

Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

Expansion Airspace —

We include currently
    unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include
    airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally
    expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted
    within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received
    within five years. Second, we must believe the success of
    obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the
    following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 62 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2006, 14 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required
    approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of a lack of
    community or political support that could impede the expansion
    process. The remaining six landfills required approval mainly
    due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit
    application processes would not meet the one or five year
    requirements, generally due to state-specific permitting
    procedures.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined, an airspace utilization factor (AUF) is established
    to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in
    tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained
    from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for
    settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will
    take into account several site-specific factors including
    current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected
    waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining,
    depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to moisture
    through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate. In
    addition, the



initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent
    multi-level review by our engineering group. Our historical
    experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at
    a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the
    waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under
    the permit requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    available airspace, we also include the projected costs for
    development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost
    related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the
    expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill
    amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream,
    geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the
    number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We
    then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us
    the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is
    received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton
    amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with
    each final capping event, for assets related to closure and
    post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or
    to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or
    higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the
    opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will
    receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is
    determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be
    considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill
    asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If
    it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion
    permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the
    expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— We are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
    that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities
    include potentially responsible party (“PRP”)
    investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees,
    as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and
    clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs
    directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses
    associated with environmental remediation obligations when such
    amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We
    routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and
    determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on
    several estimates and assumptions.

We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs.

Asset Impairments

— Our long-lived assets,
    including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our
    financial statements based on their cost less accumulated
    depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards
    require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they
    become impaired. If significant events or



changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
    asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test
    of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset
    or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows.
    If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified
    for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has
    occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the
    projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of
    undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any
    impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset
    group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either
    an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis
    of the asset or asset group or an actual third-party valuation.
    If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be
    less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an
    impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the
    period that the impairment indicator occurs.

Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset
    group;

•

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition;

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group,
    including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

•

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
    long-lived asset;

•

Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a
    history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
    use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
    asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

If any of these or other indicators occur, the asset is reviewed
    to determine whether there has been an impairment. Estimating
    future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections
    may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are other
    considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as
    described below.

Landfills —

Certain of the indicators listed
    above require significant judgment and understanding of the
    waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill —

At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the book value of goodwill to its implied fair value.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting
    the fair value of each of our reporting unit’s
    (Group’s) identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair
    value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting
    unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being
    initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be
    performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes
    in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would
    indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill
    has been impaired.

Self-insurance reserves and recoveries

— We
    have retained a portion of the risks related to our health and
    welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’
    compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities associated with
    the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses,
    including incurred but not reported losses, generally is
    estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by
    factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our
    estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly
    different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the
    frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly
    different than what we assume. Estimated insurance recoveries
    related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we
    believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Operating
    Revenues

Our operating revenues in 2006 were $13.4 billion, compared
    with $13.1 billion in 2005 and $12.5 billion in 2004.
    We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator (which
    includes our

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants, or IPPs) and
    Recycling Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable
    segments. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to
    revenues during each year provided by our six operating Groups
    and our Other waste services:

Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
    collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling
    services. Some of the fees we charge to our customers for
    collection services are billed in advance; a



liability for future service is recorded when we bill the
    customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are
    actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist
    of tipping fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume
    and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities
    and are normally billed monthly or semi-monthly. Fees charged at
    transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste
    deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting
    and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site, and are
    normally billed monthly. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on
    the type and volume of waste received at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and
    steam. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling
    Group as well as our four geographic operating Groups, generally
    consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties
    and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations
    have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Base Business

— Revenue growth from yield on
    base business reflects the effect on our revenue from the
    pricing activities of our collection, transfer, disposal and

waste-to-energy

operations, exclusive of volume changes. Our revenue growth from
    base business yield includes not only price increases, but also
    (i) price decreases to retain customers; (ii) changes
    in average price from new and lost business; and
    (iii) certain average price changes related to the overall
    mix of services, which are due to both the types of services
    provided and the geographic locations where our services are
    provided. Our pricing excellence initiative continues to be the
    primary contributor to internal revenue growth.

In both 2005 and 2006, revenue growth from base business yield
    was primarily attributable to our collection operations, where
    we experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic
    operating Group. Our base



business yield improvement resulted largely from our focus on
    pricing our business based on market-specific factors, including
    our costs. As discussed below, the significant collection
    revenue increases due to yield have been partially offset by
    revenue declines from lower collection volumes. In assessing the
    impact of higher collection yield on our volumes, we continue to
    find that, in spite of collection volume declines, revenue
    growth from base business yield and a focus on controlling
    variable costs are providing notable earnings, margin and cash
    flow improvements.

Throughout 2006, increases in revenue due to yield on base
    business at our transfer stations and for our construction and
    demolition and municipal solid waste streams at our landfills
    were also noteworthy. These improvements were due to the
    practices implemented as a result of our findings from our
    pricing studies. The increases in transfer station revenues in
    2006 were the most significant in the Eastern and Western
    portions of the United States. At our landfills, construction
    and demolition revenue growth from yield was the most
    significant in the West and South and municipal solid waste
    revenue growth from yield was provided by the East, South and
    Midwest. In 2005, our transfer business in the East and
    municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the South
    provided the most significant revenue growth from base business
    yield in those lines of our business.

We also experienced substantial yield contributions to revenues
    from our

waste-to-energy

facilities in the second half of 2005 and through the third
    quarter of 2006. The revenue improvements at our

waste-to-energy

facilities were largely due to significant increases in the
    rates charged for electricity under our long-term contracts with
    electric utilities, which generally are indexed to natural gas
    prices.

Our environmental cost recovery fee, which is included in base
    business yield, increased revenues on a

year-over-year

basis by $43 million in 2006 and $33 million in 2005.
    Other fee programs, which were targeted at recovering the costs
    we incur for services that are included in base business yield,
    such as fees for the collection of past due balances, also
    contributed to yield improvement in 2006.

The 2005 revenue improvements attributable to yield discussed
    above were partially offset by a general decline in yield in
    special waste landfill disposal operations, noted principally in
    our Midwest and Southern Groups.

Commodity

— Our revenues in both 2005 and 2006
    declined as compared with the prior year due to price decreases
    in recycling commodities. Average prices for old corrugated
    cardboard dropped by 8% in both 2005 and 2006, from $85 per
    ton in 2004 to $78 per ton in 2005 and to $72 per ton
    in 2006. Average prices for old newsprint were also down by
    about 3% in 2005 and 7% in 2006, from $86 per ton in 2004 to
    $83 per ton in 2005 and to $77 per ton in 2006.

A significant portion of revenues attributable to commodities is
    rebated to our suppliers of recyclable materials. Accordingly,
    changes in our revenues due to fluctuations in commodity prices
    have a corresponding impact on our cost of goods sold.

Fuel surcharges and fees

— Fuel surcharges
    increased revenues

year-over-year

by $117 million for 2006 and $157 million for 2005.
    These increases are due to our continued effort to pass on
    higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. The
    substantial increases in revenue provided by our fuel surcharge
    program can generally be attributed to (i) increases in
    market prices for fuel; (ii) an increase in the number of
    customers who participate in our fuel surcharge program; and
    (iii) the revision of our fuel surcharge program at the
    beginning of the third quarter of 2005 to incorporate the
    indirect fuel cost increases passed on to us by subcontracted
    haulers and vendors.

Increases in our operating expenses due to higher diesel fuel
    prices include our direct fuel costs for our operations, which
    are included in

Operating Expenses — Fuel

, as
    well as estimated indirect fuel costs, which are included
    primarily in

Operating Expenses — Subcontractor
    Costs.

As discussed in the

Operating Expenses

section
    below, during 2006 our fuel surcharge program recovered both
    components of our higher costs. Our fuel surcharge program
    substantially recovered these costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily
    related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by
    various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our
    landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not
    had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for
    the periods included in the table above.

Volume

— Declines in revenue due to lower
    volumes between 2006 and 2005 were driven by decreases in our
    collection volumes, due primarily to our focus on improving the
    margins in this line of business through pricing.



These revenue declines were the most significant in our
    residential and industrial collection operations, with our
    Eastern, Southern and Midwestern Groups experiencing the most
    notable decreases. Our commercial collection operations also had
    declines in revenue due to lower volumes in 2006, principally in
    the Midwestern and Eastern Groups. The decline in revenue due to
    lower volumes for our collection operations was also due to a
    decrease in hurricane related revenues in the South.

The revenue declines in our collection businesses in 2006 were
    partially offset by increased disposal volumes in all of our
    geographic regions through the first nine months of the year.
    Our special waste, municipal solid waste and construction and
    demolition waste streams were the primary drivers of this growth
    in revenues due to higher volumes. We believe that the strength
    of the economy throughout most of the year and favorable weather
    in many parts of the country were the primary drivers of the
    higher disposal volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we
    experienced a decline in disposal volumes as compared with the
    fourth quarter of 2005, which we believe is due to the lack of
    hurricane volumes in 2006, competition, impacts of our pricing
    initiatives and an economic softening in certain lines of our
    business in certain parts of the country.

Also contributing to the decline in our revenues due to lower
    volumes for 2006 were (i) the completion of the
    construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a
    municipality in Canada in early 2006; (ii) the
    deconsolidation of a variable interest entity during the second
    quarter of 2006; and (iii) decreased volumes from our
    transfer station and recycling operations.

Revenues due to changes in volumes were relatively flat when
    comparing 2005 with 2004. This was generally because of the
    combined impacts of (i) a decline in revenues associated
    with hurricanes; (ii) increases in recycling and landfill
    disposal volumes; and (iii) lower revenue from residential,
    commercial and industrial collection volumes, particularly in
    the East and Midwest, which can generally be attributed to our
    focus on improving our margins by increasing yield.

Our revenue due to volumes generated from hurricane related
    services were $56 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 as compared with $115 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2004. The $59 million
    decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain
    of our operations in the Gulf Coast region during 2005 as a
    result of the severe destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. In
    addition, much of our 2004 hurricane related revenues was
    associated with subcontracted services, which generated
    comparatively lower margins. In 2005, we generally elected not
    to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not
    support the required services with internal resources.

When excluding the impacts of the hurricanes, revenue due to
    higher volumes increased $62 million, or 0.5% during 2005.
    This increase was largely due to (i) increased recycling
    volumes provided by several brokerage contracts;
    (ii) increased landfill disposal volumes in the Midwest,
    West and South; (iii) increased transfer station volumes in
    the West and the South; and (iv) increased residential
    collection volumes in the West. Also included as a component of
    revenue growth from volumes in 2005 was revenue generated from
    our construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a
    municipality in Canada. The revenue generated by this project
    was low margin and largely offset by a corresponding increase in
    cost of goods sold

.

These revenue increases were largely offset by volume declines
    experienced in each line of business in the Eastern portion of
    the United States and significant volume declines in our
    collection business in the Midwest.

Acquisitions and divestitures

— The net impact
    of acquisitions and divestitures on our revenues was a decrease
    of $102 million in 2006 and an increase of $50 million
    in 2005. The significant change in these impacts is a result of
    our divestiture plan, which was initiated in the third quarter
    of 2005.

Operating
    Expenses

Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related
    benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and
    repairs included below), which include salaries and wages,
    bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and
    the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and
    disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party
    disposal facilities and transfer stations;
    (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment,
    vehicles and facilities and related labor costs;
    (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of
    independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal
    facilities and are driven by transportation costs such as fuel
    prices;



(v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates
    paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities;
    (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil
    to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment;
    (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include
    landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees
    and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which
    include landfill remediation costs, leachate and methane
    collection and treatment, other landfill site costs and interest
    accretion on asset retirement obligations; (ix) risk
    management costs, which include workers’ compensation and
    insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs,
    which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent
    and property taxes.

Our operating expense margin improved 1.7 percentage
    points, from 66.0% in 2005 to 64.3% in 2006. This improvement
    can be attributed to the fact that we experienced increased
    revenues while controlling our total operating costs. Our
    ability to manage operating costs demonstrates progress on our
    operational excellence initiatives such as improving
    productivity, reducing fleet maintenance costs, standardizing
    operating practices and improving safety. In addition, our
    operating expenses have declined when comparing 2006 with 2005
    due in part to divestitures and reduced volumes. Divestitures
    and reduced volumes have contributed to reduced costs or have
    offset other cost increases in every category throughout 2006.

The impact of our cost control initiatives, divestitures,
    volumes and other significant factors on the comparability of
    costs incurred for each operating expense category in 2006, 2005
    and 2004 are summarized below.

Labor and related benefits

— When comparing
    2006 with 2005, these costs have increased due to annual merit
    increases and higher bonus expense due to the overall
    improvement in our performance on a

year-over-year

basis. These cost increases were partially offset by
    (i) declines in health and welfare insurance expenses, due
    to our focus on controlling costs and reductions in operations
    personnel as a result of divestitures; (ii) reduced
    overtime generally associated with our reduced volumes; and
    (iii) reduced headcount due to divestitures and our focus
    on operating efficiencies. In 2005, the

year-over-year

increase in costs was generally due to higher salary and wage
    costs, general increases in health care and benefits costs,
    increased costs attributable to contract labor and increased
    payroll taxes.

Transfer and disposal costs

— In 2006 and 2005
    the costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of
    waste at third-party transfer stations or landfills declined due
    to our focus on improving internalization. During 2006, declines
    in these costs are also attributable to the impact of
    divestitures and general volume declines.

Maintenance and repairs

— In 2006, these costs
    were relatively flat due to the offsetting impacts of increases
    in labor costs and decreases driven by (i) changes in the
    scope of maintenance projects at our

waste-to-energy

facilities; (ii) the impact of divestitures and
    (iii) various fleet initiatives, all of which have
    favorably affected our maintenance, parts and supplies costs.
    The increases in these costs in 2005 were attributable to
    (i) higher parts and supplies costs, which were driven by
    changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our

waste-to-energy

facilities



and increased volumes in our Southern and Western Groups;
    (ii) increases in the cost of lubes and oils and
    (iii) increases in the labor costs associated with our
    maintenance and repairs.

Subcontractor costs

— Throughout 2006 and 2005
    we experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to higher
    diesel fuel prices, which drive the fuel surcharges we pay to
    third-party subcontractors. Subcontractor cost increases
    attributable to higher fuel costs were offset by the revenue
    generated from our fuel surcharge program, which is reflected as
    fuel yield increases within

Operating
    Revenues.

Additionally, in 2006, the increase in
    our subcontractor costs due to higher fuel costs was partially
    offset by a decrease attributable to our divestiture of
    under-performing and non-strategic operations and decreases in
    volumes.

In 2005, we also incurred additional transportation costs due to
    increased volumes in subcontracted work, particularly in our
    National Accounts organization and our Western Group. This cost
    increase was partially offset by a

year-over-year

decline in the utilization of subcontractors to assist in
    providing hurricane related services, which were particularly
    significant during 2004.

Cost of goods sold

— These costs are primarily
    for rebates paid to our recycling suppliers, which are driven by
    the market prices of recyclable commodities. In 2006, we
    experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities and
    reduced recycling volumes.

Additionally, in 2006, the decrease in costs of goods sold was
    partially due to completion of the construction of an integrated
    waste facility in Canada in early 2006. The increase in cost of
    goods sold in 2005 was partially due to costs incurred to
    construct this integrated waste facility. Also in 2005, we
    experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities than
    in prior years. This decrease in pricing was more than offset by
    increased recycling volumes in 2005 due to several new brokerage
    contracts and acquisitions.

Fuel

— We experienced an estimated average
    increase of $0.31 per gallon for 2006 as compared with 2005
    and of $0.59 per gallon for 2005 as compared with 2004.
    While our fuel surcharge is designed to recover the cost
    increases incurred as a result of higher fuel prices, increased
    fuel costs continue to negatively affect our operating margin
    percentages. Revenues generated by our fuel surcharge program
    are reflected as fuel yield increases within

Operating
    Revenues.

Disposal and franchise fees and taxes

— In
    2006, these costs have remained relatively flat primarily as a
    result of decreases associated with divestitures and general
    volume declines, partially offset by increases in rates for
    mandated fees and taxes in certain markets. In 2005, these cost
    increases were the result of increased volumes and increased
    rates for mandated fees and taxes. Certain of these cost
    increases are passed through to our customers, and have been
    reflected as fee yield increases within

Operating
    Revenues.

Landfill operating costs

— For 2006 and 2005,
    these cost increases have generally been related to higher site
    maintenance, leachate collection, monitoring and testing, and
    closure and post-closure expenses.

Risk management

— Over the last two years, we
    have been increasingly successful in reducing these costs
    largely due to reduced workers’ compensation costs, which
    can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced
    accident and injury rates.

Other operating expenses

— The lower costs in
    2006 as compared with 2005 can be attributed to
    (i) Hurricane Katrina related support costs in 2005,
    particularly in Louisiana, where we built Camp Waste Management
    to house and feed hundreds of our employees who worked in the
    New Orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts;
    (ii) higher rental expense in 2005; and (iii) a
    decrease related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest
    entity in early 2006.

In addition to the 2005 items noted above, the increase in our
    other operating costs when comparing 2005 with 2004 can be
    attributed to (i) a

year-over-year

decrease in the realization of gains on sales of assets;
    (ii) costs incurred during 2005 attributable to labor
    strikes in New Jersey and Canada; and (iii) an increase in
    costs generated by the variable interest entity discussed above.



Selling,
    General and Administrative

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
    (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related
    insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and
    equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which
    include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services;
    (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances
    for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and
    (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which
    include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and
    data telecommunications, advertising, travel and entertainment,
    rentals, postage and printing.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
    selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended
    December 31 (in millions):

Our professional fees and, to a lesser extent, our labor costs
    and other general and administrative costs, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 were increased by $20 million for
    non-capitalizable costs incurred to support the planned
    implementation of our new revenue management system. This
    increase and other significant changes in our selling, general
    and administrative expenses are summarized below.

Labor and related benefits

— In both 2006 and
    2005, these costs increased

year-over-year

due to higher bonus expense attributable to the overall
    improvement in our performance and higher non-cash compensation
    costs associated with the equity-based compensation provided for
    by our long-term incentive plan. Also contributing to the
    increase in labor costs in 2006 and 2005 are higher salaries and
    hourly wages driven by annual merit raises and an increase in
    the size of our sales force. These increases were partially
    offset by savings associated with our 2005 restructuring.
    Fluctuations in our use of contract labor for corporate support
    functions caused an increase in 2006 and a decline in 2005 as
    compared with the prior year periods.

Professional Fees

— In 2006, our professional
    fees were higher than in 2005 due to higher consulting fees
    associated with our pricing initiatives and the development of
    our revenue management system. However, the overall increase in
    consulting fees in 2006 was partially offset by costs incurred
    during 2005 for computer support costs related to a revenue
    management project for our Recycling Group. In 2005, we
    experienced a decline in professional fees as compared with the
    prior year as a result of lower litigation and defense costs and
    lower consulting costs associated with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act as we moved from the implementation phase in
    2004 to continued monitoring and testing in 2005.

Other

— We are currently undergoing unclaimed
    property audits, which are being conducted by various state
    authorities. The property subject to review in this audit
    process generally includes unclaimed wages, vendor payments and
    customer refunds. During 2006, we submitted unclaimed property
    filings with all states. As a result of our findings, we
    determined that we had unrecorded obligations associated with
    unclaimed property for escheatable items for various periods
    between 1980 and 2004. The increase in our expenses includes a
    $20 million charge to record these estimated unrecorded
    obligations. Refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information related to the nature of
    this charge. Additionally, in both 2006 and 2005, our other
    costs increased due to higher sales and marketing costs
    associated with our national advertising campaign and higher
    travel and entertainment costs due partially to the development
    of our revenue management system and our efforts to implement
    various initiatives.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of
    property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital
    leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years;
    (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including



those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill
    development, construction, closure and post-closure, on a

units-of-consumption

method as landfill airspace is consumed over the remaining
    permitted and expansion capacity of a site;
    (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs
    arising from final capping obligations on a

units-of-consumption

method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity
    associated with each final capping event; and
    (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite
    life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a
    straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related
    agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the
    type of asset.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by
    $27 million during 2006 when compared with 2005. The
    decrease was due in part to the suspension of depreciation on
    assets

held-for-sale,

divestitures and the discontinuation of depreciation on
    enterprise-wide software that is now fully depreciated.

The comparability of our depreciation and amortization expense
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 has
    also been significantly affected by (i) a $21 million
    charge to landfill amortization recognized in 2005 to adjust the
    amortization periods of nine of our leased landfills and
    (ii) adjustments to landfill airspace and landfill asset
    retirement cost amortization recorded in each year for changes
    in estimates related to our final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, landfill amortization
    expense was reduced by $1 million, $13 million and
    $18 million, respectively, for the effects of these changes
    in estimate. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense
    resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final
    capping changes.

Restructuring

Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if
    we are operating under the most advantageous structure. These
    reviews have highlighted efficiencies and cost savings we could
    capture by restructuring. The most significant cost savings we
    have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable
    to the labor and related benefits component of our
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses.

During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified
    our organizational structure by eliminating certain support
    functions performed at the Group or Corporate office. We also
    eliminated the Canadian Group office, which reduced the number
    of our operating Groups from seven to six. This reorganization
    has reduced costs at the Group and Corporate offices and
    increased the accountability of our Market Areas. We recorded
    $28 million of pre-tax charges for costs associated with
    the implementation of the new structure, principally for
    employee severance and benefit costs.

Asset impairments

— During the second and third
    quarters of 2006, we recorded impairment charges of
    $13 million and $5 million, respectively, for
    operations we intend to sell as part of our divestiture program.
    The charges were required to reduce the carrying values of the
    operations to their estimated fair values less the cost to sell
    in accordance with the guidance provided by
    SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, for assets to be disposed of
    by sale.



During the third and fourth quarters of 2006, we recorded
    impairment charges of $10 million and $14 million,
    respectively, for assets and businesses associated with our
    continuing operations. The charges recognized during the third
    quarter of 2006 were related to operations in our Recycling and
    Southern Groups. The charges recognized during the fourth
    quarter of 2006 were primarily attributable to the impairment of
    a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our
    expectations for future expansions.

(Income) expense from divestitures

— We
    recognized $44 million of net gains on divestitures during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, which were direct results
    of the execution of our plan to review under-performing or
    non-strategic operations and to either improve their performance
    or dispose of the operations. The majority of these net gains
    was recognized during the second quarter of 2006 and relates to
    operations located in our Western Group. Total proceeds from
    divestitures completed during the year ended December 31,
    2006 were $184 million, all of which were received in cash.

Other

— During the fourth quarter of 2006, we
    recognized a charge of approximately $26 million for the
    impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the
    termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000. The party
    that purchased our interest in the joint venture had sued us,
    seeking a variety of remedies ranging from monetary damages to
    unwinding the sale of assets. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the
    arbitration tribunal ruled in the other party’s favor,
    awarding them approximately $29 million, which includes
    monetary damages, interest, and certain fees and expenses. Prior
    to the ruling, the Company had recorded a reserve of
    $3 million. For additional information regarding this
    matter refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2005

Asset impairments

— During the second quarter
    of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a $35 million charge
    for the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill located in West
    Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania. We determined that an
    impairment was necessary after the Pennsylvania Environmental
    Hearing Board upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of
    Environmental Protection of a permit application for a vertical
    expansion at the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the
    Company reviewed the options available at the Pottstown Landfill
    and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options.
    After such evaluation and considering the length of time
    required for the appeal process and the permit application
    review, we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial.
    This decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the
    permitting delays, which would hinder our ability to fully
    utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill’s
    required closure in 2010. We continued to operate the Pottstown
    Landfill using existing permitted airspace through the
    landfill’s permit expiration date of October 2005.

Through June 30, 2005, our “Property and
    equipment” had included approximately $80 million of
    accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system.
    Approximately $59 million of these costs were specifically
    associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts
    required to develop and configure that software for our use,
    while the remaining costs were associated with the general
    efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our
    existing applications and hardware. The development efforts
    associated with our revenue management system were suspended in
    2003. Since that time, there have been changes in the viable
    software alternatives available to address our current needs.
    During the third quarter of 2005, we concluded our assessment of
    potential revenue management system options. As a result, we
    entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the
    license, implementation and maintenance of certain of its
    applications software, including waste and recycling
    functionality. We believe that these newly licensed
    applications, when fully implemented, will provide substantially
    better capabilities and functionality than the software we were
    developing. Our plan to implement this newly licensed software
    resulted in a $59 million charge in the third quarter of
    2005 for the software that had been under development and
    capitalized costs associated with the development efforts
    specific to that software.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an
    $18 million charge for asset impairments. This charge was
    primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our
    Eastern Group, as a result of a change in our expectations for
    future expansions, and the impairment of capitalized software
    costs related to two applications we decided not to develop
    further.



(Income) expense from divestitures

— During the
    first quarter of 2005, we recognized a $39 million gain as
    a result of the divestiture of a landfill in Ontario, Canada,
    which was required as a result of a Divestiture Order from the
    Canadian Competition Bureau. During the remainder of 2005, we
    recognized a total of $40 million in gains as a result of
    the divestiture of operations. With the exception of our
    divestiture of the Ontario, Canada landfill, our divestitures
    during 2005 were direct results of the execution of our plan to
    review under-performing or non-strategic operations and to
    either improve their performance or dispose of the operations.

Total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 were $172 million, of which
    $140 million was received in cash, $23 million was in
    the form of a note receivable and $9 million was in the
    form of non-monetary assets.

Other

— In the first quarter of 2005, we
    recognized a charge of approximately $16 million for the
    impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of
    stockholders that opted not to participate in the settlement of
    the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998
    and 1999 activity. During the third quarter of 2005, we settled
    our ongoing defense costs and possible indemnity obligations for
    four former officers of WM Holdings related to legacy litigation
    brought against them by the SEC. As a result, we recorded a
    $26.8 million charge for the funding of the court-ordered
    distribution of $27.5 million to our shareholders in
    settlement of the legacy litigation against the former officers.
    These charges were partially offset by the recognition of a
    $12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2005, which was primarily for adjustments to
    our receivables and estimated obligations for non-solid waste
    operations divested in 1999 and 2000.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2004

For 2004, the significant items included within “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” were (i) $17 million in impairment losses
    primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and
    software development costs; (ii) $12 million in gains
    on divestitures that primarily related to certain

Port-O-Let

®

operations; and (iii) $18 million in miscellaneous net
    gains, which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated
    obligations associated with non-solid waste services, which were
    divested in 1999 and 2000.

Overview

— Revenue growth from base business
    yield improvement, which is primarily the result of our
    continued focus on pricing, significantly contributed to the
    operating income of each of our geographic Groups during the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Base business yield
    provided revenue growth for each line of business in 2006, but
    was driven primarily by our collection operations, where we
    experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic
    operating Group for the second consecutive year. The operating
    results of the Groups have also benefited from our focus on cost
    control and from increases in higher margin disposal volumes
    during



both 2005 and 2006. These improvements were partially offset by
    declines in revenues due to lower volumes in the collection line
    of business, particularly in our Eastern Group. See the
    additional discussion in the

Operating Revenues

section
    above.

The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006
    also compare favorably with the prior years due to the
    $27 million restructuring charge recognized during the
    third quarter of 2005. “Corporate and other” reflects
    $10 million of this impact with the remaining
    $17 million allocated across the operating Groups. See
    additional discussion of these charges in the

Restructuring

section above.

Other significant items affecting the comparability of the
    operating segments’ results of operations for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are summarized below:

Eastern

— The Group’s operating income for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively affected by
    $26 million in charges associated with (i) the
    impairment of businesses being sold as part of our divestiture
    program and (ii) the impairment of a landfill. The year
    ended December 31, 2005 was negatively affected by the
    recognition of $44 million in impairment charges related
    primarily to the Pottstown landfill. Finally, the operating
    results of our Eastern Group for 2006 and 2005 were negatively
    affected by costs incurred in connection with labor strikes. For
    the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred
    $14 million of costs related primarily to a strike in the
    New York City area. The Group incurred similar costs during the
    first quarter of 2005 for a labor strike in New Jersey, which
    decreased operating income for the year ended December 31,
    2005 by approximately $9 million.

Midwest

— Positively affecting 2005 results
    compared with the prior year was a decline in landfill
    amortization expense generally as a result of changes in certain
    estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations.

Southern

— During 2005, several large
    non-recurring type items were recognized, impacting comparisons
    to the other periods presented. These items include
    $13 million of pre-tax gains recognized on the divestiture
    of operations during 2005 and declines in earnings related to
    (i) hurricanes, largely due to the temporary suspension of
    operations in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina;
    (ii) the effects of higher landfill amortization costs,
    generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to
    align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with
    the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting
    their operations; and (iii) higher landfill amortization
    expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to
    our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.

Western

— Gains on divestitures of operations
    were $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    as compared with $24 million for 2005 and $10 million
    for 2004.

Wheelabrator

— The electric rates we charge to
    our customers at our

waste-to-energy

facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of
    2005 as a result of higher market prices for natural gas. The
    rates we charge customers are indexed to natural gas prices,
    which increased significantly as a result of hurricane-related
    production disruptions, increased demand and increases in crude
    oil prices. This increase in rates was the principal reason for
    the 2005 increase in Wheelabrator’s income from operations
    as compared with 2004. The favorable impact of market prices for
    natural gas was partially offset by higher costs of goods sold
    and higher repair and maintenance costs due to the scope and
    timing of maintenance performed in 2005 as compared with 2004.

Recycling

— During 2006, the Group recognized
    $10 million of charges for a loss on divestiture and an
    impairment of certain under-performing operations, which were
    slightly more than offset by savings associated with the
    Group’s cost control efforts. The decrease in income from
    operations in our Recycling Group during 2005 when compared with
    2004 can generally be attributed to (i) an increase in the
    rebates paid to our suppliers as a result of increased
    competition; (ii) costs related to the deployment of new
    software; and (iii) higher subcontractor costs primarily
    related to increased distances traveled by third-party haulers.

The comparability of operating results for the Recycling Group
    for all of the periods presented has been affected by variances
    in the market prices for recyclable commodities. During the
    three years ended December 31, 2006,

year-over-year

changes in the quarterly average market prices of OCC and ONP
    have



ranged from a decrease of as much as 33% to an increase of as
    much as 36%. However, declines in the market prices for
    recyclable commodities resulted in only marginal

year-over-year

decreases to our income from operations during 2006 and 2005
    because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are
    generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers.

Other

— The changes in “Income from
    operations” attributed to our other operations is driven
    primarily by the 2005 recognition of a $39 million pre-tax
    gain resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in
    Ontario, Canada. This impact is included in “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As
    this landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005
    reorganization, historical financial information associated with
    its operations has not been allocated to our remaining
    reportable segments. Accordingly, these impacts have been
    included in Other. The impact of this 2005 divestiture gain is
    partially offset by the effect of certain other quarter-end
    adjustments related to the operating segments that are recorded
    in consolidation and, due to timing, not included in the measure
    of segment income from operations used to assess their
    performance for the periods disclosed.

Corporate

— Expenses were higher in 2005 as
    compared with 2006 primarily due to impairment charges in 2005
    of $68 million associated with capitalized software costs
    and $31 million of net charges associated with various
    legal and divestiture matters. In 2006, we recognized
    $37 million of net charges associated with various legal
    and divestiture matters. These items are discussed in the

(Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and
    Unusual Items

section above.

In 2006, we experienced lower risk management and employee
    health and welfare plan costs largely due to our focus on safety
    and controlling costs. These cost savings have been largely
    offset by the following cost increases: (i) a
    $20 million charge recorded to recognize unrecorded
    obligations associated with unclaimed property, which is
    discussed in the

Selling, General and Administrative

section above; (ii) increased incentive compensation
    expense associated with the Company’s current strong
    performance; (iii) higher consulting fees and sales
    commissions primarily related to our pricing initiatives;
    (iv) an increase in our marketing costs due to our national
    advertising campaign; and (v) the centralization of support
    functions that were provided by our Group offices prior to our
    2005 reorganization.

The higher expenses in 2005 as compared with 2004 were driven by
    the previously noted $99 million charged to “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” during 2005. Also contributing to the increase in
    expenses during 2005 were (i) non-cash employee
    compensation costs associated with current year changes in
    equity-based compensation; (ii) inflation in employee
    health care costs; (iii) salary and wage annual merit
    increases; (iv) costs for sales and marketing programs; and
    (v) costs at Corporate associated with our July 2005
    restructuring charge and organizational changes, which were
    partially offset by associated savings at Corporate.

Interest
    Expense

The increase in interest expense in 2006 and 2005 is generally
    related to higher market interest rates, which have resulted in
    a decrease in the benefit of our interest rate swaps and an
    increase in the interest rates of our variable rate debt. The
    increase in our interest expense in 2006 due to higher market
    interest rates was partially offset by the impact of a decrease
    in our outstanding debt, which is due to our repayment of
    borrowings throughout the year.

We use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure
    to changes in market interest rates. The combined impact of
    active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in
    a net interest expense increase of $4 million for 2006 and
    net interest expense reductions of $39 million and
    $90 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    significant decline in the benefit recognized as a result of our
    active interest rate swap agreements is attributable to the
    increase in short-term market interest rates. Our periodic
    interest obligations under our active interest rate swap
    agreements are based on a spread from the three-month LIBOR,
    which has increased from 2.56% at December 31, 2004 to
    4.54% at December 31, 2005 and to 5.36% at
    December 31, 2006. Included in the $4 million net
    increase in interest expense realized in 2006 for terminated and
    active interest rate swap agreements is a $41 million
    reduction in interest expense related to the amortization of
    terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate swaps are
    expected to reduce interest expense by $37 million in 2007,
    $33 million in 2008 and $19 million in 2009.

In addition, we have $652 million of tax-exempt borrowings
    remarketed either daily or weekly to effectively maintain a
    variable yield. The interest rates of these borrowings increased
    over the last two years due to higher market rates.

Interest
    Income

The increase in interest income when comparing 2006 with 2005 is
    due to an increase in our investments in variable rate demand
    notes and auction rate securities throughout the year. Interest
    income for 2006 and 2004 includes interest income of
    $14 million and $46 million, respectively, realized on
    tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several
    federal audits.

Equity
    in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities

In the first and second quarters of 2004, we acquired an equity
    interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities.
    The activities of these facilities drive our “Equity in net
    losses of unconsolidated entities”. The significant
    decrease in the equity losses attributable to these facilities
    when comparing 2006 with prior years is due to (i) the
    estimated effect of a 36% phase-out of Section 45K
    (formerly Section 29) credits generated during 2006 on
    our contractual obligations associated with funding the
    facilities’ losses as a result of a substantial increase in
    market prices of crude oil; (ii) the suspension of
    operations at the facilities from May to September of 2006; and
    (iii) a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately
    reflect our

life-to-date

obligations to fund the costs of operating the facilities and
    the value of our investment. The increase in these losses from
    2004 to 2005 is due to the timing of our initial investments in
    2004.

These equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit
    realized as a result of these investments. The impact of these
    facilities on our provision for taxes is discussed below within

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes.

Additional
    information related to these investments is included in
    Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Minority
    Interest

On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two special purpose
    type variable interest entities as a result of our
    implementation of FIN 46(R). Our minority interest expense
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to the other
    members’ equity interest in the earnings of these entities.
    Additional information related to these investments is included
    in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other,
    net

Our other income and expense is primarily attributable to the
    impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian
    operations.



Provision
    for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

We recorded a provision for income taxes of $325 million in
    2006, a benefit from income taxes of $90 million in 2005,
    and a provision for income taxes of $247 million in 2004
    resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately
    22.1%, (8.2)%, and 21.0% for each of the three years,
    respectively. When excluding the effect of interest income
    related to audit settlements, the settlement of various federal
    and state tax audit matters during 2006, 2005 and 2004 resulted
    in a reduction in our provision for income taxes of
    $149 million, (representing a 10.1 percentage point
    reduction in our effective tax rate), $398 million,
    (representing a 36.4 percentage point reduction in our
    effective tax rate) and $101 million,  (representing an
    8.5 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate),
    respectively.

The benefit of non-conventional fuel tax credits is derived from
    methane gas projects at our landfills and our investments in two
    coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities, which are
    discussed in the

Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated
    Entities

section above. These tax credits are available
    through 2007 pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal
    Revenue Code, and are phased-out if the price of crude oil
    exceeds a threshold annual average price determined by the IRS.
    Our effective tax rate for 2006 reflects a phase-out of 36% of
    Section 45K tax credits generated during 2006 and a
    temporary shut down of the synthetic fuel production facilities.
    We have developed our estimate of the phase-out using market
    information for crude oil prices as of December 31, 2006.
    Our synthetic fuel production facility investments resulted in a
    decrease in our tax provision of $64 million for 2006,
    $145 million for 2005 and $131 million for 2004, which
    more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense
    for those entities. Refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
    impact of these investments on our provision for taxes.

For all periods, a portion of the difference in income taxes
    computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes
    is due to state and local income taxes.

Additionally, in 2006, we recorded reductions to income tax
    expense related to (i) a decrease in our effective state
    tax rate resulting in a $9 million benefit related to the
    revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities;
    (ii) a $20 million tax benefit due to scheduled tax
    rate reductions in Canada and the resulting revaluation of
    related net accumulated deferred tax liabilities; and
    (iii) an $11 million state tax benefit arising from
    the reduction in the valuation allowance related to the expected
    utilization of state net operating loss and credit carryforwards.

In 2005, we recorded additional income tax expense related to
    (i) the accrual of $4 million to increase net
    accumulated deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in
    the provincial tax rate in Quebec and (ii) the accrual of
    $34 million of taxes associated with our plan to repatriate
    $496 million of accumulated earnings and capital from
    certain of our Canadian subsidiaries under the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004. These amounts were offset in part by a
    change in our estimated state effective tax rate causing us to
    realize a benefit of $16 million related to the revaluation
    of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities.

Cumulative
    Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

On March 31, 2004, we recorded a credit of $8 million,
    net of taxes, or $0.01 per diluted share, to
    “Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle”
    as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts
    as required by FIN 46(R). See Notes 2 and 19 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

General

We have consistently generated cash flows from operations in
    excess of our reinvestment needs. However, we operate in a
    capital-intensive business and continued access to various
    financing resources is vital to our continued financial
    strength. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining
    financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider
    attractive. Based on several key factors we believe are
    considered important by credit rating agencies and financial
    markets in determining our access to attractive financing
    alternatives, we expect to continue to maintain access to
    capital sources in the future. These factors include:

•

the essential nature of the services we provide and our large
    and diverse customer base;



•

our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite
    the economic environment;

•

our liquidity profile;

•

our asset base; and

•

our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and
    disciplined capital allocation.

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our
    liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our
    present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may
    arise during the year as a result of changing business
    conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working
    capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
    ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
    construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
    to and maintenance of our trucking fleet;
    (iii) refurbishments and improvements at

waste-to-energy

and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and
    equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and
    post-closure activities at our landfills; and (vi) repaying
    debt and discharging other obligations. We also are committed to
    providing our shareholders with a return on their investment
    through our capital allocation program that provides for
    dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in
    acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide
    continued growth in our business.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (the “Act”) became law. A provision of the Act allowed
    U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign
    subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005. Our Chief
    Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic
    reinvestment plan under which we repatriated $496 million
    of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005. The
    repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings.
    For a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see
    Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates
    of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade
    commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three
    months or less.



Short-term investments available for use

—
    These investments include auction rate securities and variable
    rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with long-term
    scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The
    interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a
    periodic marketing of the underlying securities through an
    auction process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest
    rate reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment
    in these securities, they have been classified as current assets
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

—
    Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds
    held in trust for the construction of various facilities or
    repayment of debt obligations, funds deposited in connection
    with landfill closure, post-closure and remediation obligations
    and insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily
    included within long-term “Other assets” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional discussion.

We have used each of these facilities to support letters of
    credit that we issue to support our insurance programs, certain
    tax-exempt bond issuances, municipal and governmental waste
    management contracts, closure and post-closure obligations and
    disposal site or transfer station operating permits. These
    facilities require us to pay fees to the financial institutions
    and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may
    occur on the letters of credit. We expect that similar
    facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of
    letter of credit capacity in the future, and we continue to
    assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we
    have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in
    advance of our business needs.

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
    Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility
    agreement under which we could borrow up to Canadian
    $410 million. The agreement was entered into to facilitate
    WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from
    its Canadian subsidiaries as discussed above.



As of December 31, 2006, we had $313 million of
    principal ($308 million net of discount) outstanding under
    this credit facility. Advances under the facility do not accrue
    interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we
    initially received were for the principal amount of the advances
    net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the
    advance, and the debt was initially recorded based on the net
    proceeds received. The advances have a weighted average
    effective interest rate of 4.8% at December 31, 2006, which
    is being amortized to interest expense with a corresponding
    increase in our recorded debt obligation using the effective
    interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2006,
    we increased the carrying value of the debt for the recognition
    of $15 million of interest expense. A total of
    $47 million of advances under the facility matured during
    2006 and were repaid with available cash. Accounting for changes
    in the Canadian currency translation rate did not significantly
    affect the carrying value of these borrowings during 2006.

Our outstanding advances mature less than one year from the date
    of issuance, but may be renewed under the terms of the facility.
    While we may elect to renew portions of our outstanding advances
    under the terms of the facility, we currently expect to repay
    our borrowings under the facility within one year with available
    cash. Accordingly, these borrowings are classified as current in
    our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of
    December 31, 2005, we had expected to repay
    $86 million of outstanding advances with available cash and
    renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility.
    Based on our expectations at that time, we classified
    $86 million as current and $254 million as long-term
    in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Senior notes

— As of December 31, 2006, we
    had $4.8 billion of outstanding senior notes. The notes
    have various maturities ranging from October 2007 to May 2032,
    and interest rates ranging from 5.00% to 8.75%. On
    October 15, 2006, $300 million of 7.0% senior
    notes matured and were repaid with cash on hand. We have
    $300 million of 7.125% senior notes that mature in
    October 2007 that we currently expect to repay with available
    cash. Accordingly, this borrowing is classified as current as of
    December 31, 2006.

Tax-exempt bonds

— We actively issue tax-exempt
    bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital
    expenditures. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    $2.4 billion of outstanding tax-exempt bonds. We issued
    $159 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2006. The proceeds
    from these debt issuances were deposited directly into a trust
    fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the
    money was raised, which is generally the construction of
    collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment
    necessary to provide waste management services. Accordingly, the
    restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not
    been included in “New borrowings” in our Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31,
    2006. As we spend monies on the specific projects being
    financed, we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds.
    As discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts
    section above, we have $94 million held in trust for future
    spending as of December 31, 2006. During 2006, we received
    $258 million from these funds for approved capital
    expenditures.

As of December 31, 2006, $606 million of our
    tax-exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to
    effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent
    is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can
    put the bonds to us. These bonds are supported by letters of
    credit that were issued primarily under our $2.4 billion,
    five-year revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of
    the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us. Accordingly,
    these obligations have been classified as long-term in our
    December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, we have
    $255 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to
    repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their
    scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds are
    unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring
    immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of
    credit supported by our long-term facilities that would serve to
    guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re-offering and
    are, therefore, considered a current obligation for financial
    reporting purposes. However, these bonds have been classified as
    long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    December 31, 2006. The classification of these obligations
    as long-term was based upon our intent to refinance the
    borrowings with other long-term financings in the event of a
    failed re-offering and our ability, in the event other sources
    of long-term financing are not available, to use our five-year
    revolving credit facility.

Tax-exempt project bonds

— As of
    December 31, 2006, we had $352 million of outstanding
    tax-exempt project bonds. These debt instruments are primarily
    used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the development of

waste-to-energy

facilities. The bonds generally require periodic principal
    installment payments. As of



December 31, 2006, $46 million of these bonds are
    remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to
    effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent
    is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can
    put the bonds to us. Repayment of these bonds has been
    guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our five-year
    revolving credit facility. Accordingly, these obligations have
    been classified as long-term in our December 31, 2006
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Approximately $61 million of
    our tax-exempt project bonds will be repaid with either
    available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve
    months.

Interest rate swaps

— We manage the interest
    rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest
    rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and
    floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2006, the interest
    payments on $2.4 billion of our fixed rate debt have been
    swapped to variable rates, allowing us to maintain approximately
    64% of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 36% of
    our debt at variable interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting
    for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of
    debt instruments by $19 million as of December 31,
    2006 and $47 million at December 31, 2005.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

—
    During 2006 and 2005, our cash flows from operating activities
    increased $149 million and $173 million, respectively,
    on a

year-over-year

basis. In both years, the increases were due to growth in our
    operating income and comparative changes in our receivables and
    accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and were partially
    offset by increases in cash paid for income taxes.

The change in our receivables balances, net of effects of
    acquisitions and divestitures, provided a source of cash of
    $12 million in 2006, compared to a use of cash in both 2005
    and 2004 of $102 million and $223 million,
    respectively. In 2006, our receivables balances declined in part
    due to a decrease in fourth quarter revenues as compared with
    the prior year, but also due to improved efficiency of
    collections. We have created and implemented new processes to
    assist our Market Areas with collections. The increases in our
    receivables balances, and resulting uses of cash in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, in 2005 and 2004 were
    primarily related to increased revenues. However, the
    significant

year-over-year

change can partially be attributed to 2004 receivable balances
    associated with significant revenues generated from hurricane
    related services provided in the second half of 2004.

We made income tax payments of $475 million in 2006,
    $233 million in 2005 and $136 million in 2004. The
    increase in 2006 is primarily the result of improved earnings, a
    36% phase-out of Section 45K tax credits and the temporary
    shutdown of our two coal-based synthetic fuel production
    facilities. There was no phase-out of Section 45K tax
    credits or temporary shutdown of the coal-based synthetic fuel
    production facilities in either 2005 or 2004. The increase from
    2004 to 2005 is the combined result of increased earnings and
    the expiration of first-year bonus depreciation on property
    acquired after September 1, 2001 and before January 1,
    2005, which favorably impacted taxes paid in 2004.

Our provision for income taxes has been significantly affected
    by tax audit settlements in each period presented. Tax audit
    settlements and related interest positively affected our net
    income by $158 million in 2006, $398 million in 2005
    and $129 million in 2004. Additionally, we received cash
    refunds of $62 million in 2006 and $71 million in 2005
    related to these tax audit settlements. The remaining impact of
    these settlements has been reflected as changes in our
    “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” for the
    related periods.

The comparability of our operating cash flows for the periods
    presented is also affected by our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires reductions in income taxes
    payable attributable to excess tax benefits associated with
    equity-based compensation to be included in cash flows from
    financing



activities, which are discussed below. Prior to adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R), our excess tax benefits associated
    with equity-based compensation were included within cash flows
    from operating activities as a change in “Accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities.” During 2005 and 2004, these
    excess tax benefits improved our operating cash flows by
    approximately $17 million and $37 million,
    respectively.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

— We used
    $788 million of our cash resources for investing activities
    during 2006, a decrease of $274 million compared with 2005.
    This decrease is primarily due to (i) a $417 million
    increase in net cash flows provided by purchases and sales of
    short-term investments; (ii) a $110 million decline in
    spending for acquisitions of businesses; and (iii) a
    $46 million increase in proceeds from divestitures of
    businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. The
    effect of these items on our cash used in investing activities
    was partially offset by a $149 million increase in capital
    spending and a $142 million decline in net receipts from
    restricted trust and escrow accounts.

Net sales of short-term investments provided $122 million
    of cash in 2006, compared with net purchases of short-term
    investments of $295 million during 2005. In 2006, we
    experienced net sales of short-term investments as we utilized
    our short-term investments and available cash to fund our common
    stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments, which
    are discussed below.

Our spending on acquisitions decreased from $142 million
    during 2005 to $32 million in 2006. As we make progress on
    our divestiture program, we plan to increase our focus on
    accretive acquisitions and other investments that will
    contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance
    and expand our existing service offerings.

Proceeds from divestitures (net of cash divested) and other
    sales of assets were $240 million in 2006 compared with
    $194 million in 2005, an increase of $46 million.
    Approximately $89 million of our 2005 proceeds were related
    to the sale of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada as
    required by a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition
    Tribunal. When excluding the cash proceeds generated by this
    transaction, proceeds from divestitures have increased by
    $135 million during 2006 when compared with 2005. This
    increase is primarily a result of the execution of our plan to
    divest of certain under-performing and non-strategic operations.

Net funds received from our restricted trust and escrow
    accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of
    tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed
    $253 million to our investing activities in 2006 compared
    with $395 million in 2005. The decrease is due to a decline
    in new tax-exempt borrowings.

We used $1,329 million during 2006 for capital
    expenditures, compared with $1,180 million in 2005. The
    increase occurred across all asset categories. However, our
    landfill and vehicles asset categories were the most
    significantly affected.

We used $1,062 million of our cash resources for investing
    activities during 2005, an increase of $180 million
    compared with 2004. This increase is primarily due to a
    $266 million change in net cash flows associated with
    purchases and sales of short-term investments. Net purchases of
    short-term investments during 2005 were $295 million
    compared with net purchases of $29 million during 2004. The
    increase in our short-term investments available for use as of
    December 31, 2005 can generally be attributed to an
    increase in our available cash, which we used to fund, among
    other things, a $275 million accelerated share repurchase
    agreement that became effective in January 2006 and our first
    quarter 2006 dividend that was paid in March 2006. Our share
    repurchases and dividends are discussed in our

Net Cash Used
    in Financing Activities

section below.

The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities as a
    result of our short-term investments was partially offset by
    (i) an increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses
    (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets and (ii) a
    decrease in capital expenditures. Proceeds from divestitures of
    businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were
    $194 million in 2005 and $96 million in 2004. The
    $98 million increase from 2004 to 2005 is largely
    attributable to the sale of one of our landfills in Ontario,
    Canada. Capital expenditures were $1,180 million in 2005,
    which is $78 million less than we invested in capital in
    2004.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The
    most significant changes in our financing cash flows during the
    three years ended December 31, 2006 are related to
    (i) increases in cash paid for our repurchases of common
    stock and cash dividends; (ii) variances in our net debt
    repayments, which can generally be attributed to scheduled



maturities; and (iii) variances in proceeds from the
    exercise of common stock options and warrants. These financing
    activities are discussed below.

Our 2006 and 2005 share repurchases and dividend payments
    have been made in accordance with a three-year capital
    allocation program that was approved by our Board of Directors.
    This capital allocation program authorizes up to
    $1.2 billion of combined share repurchases and dividend
    payments each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. In June 2006, the
    Board of Directors authorized up to $350 million of
    additional share repurchases in 2006, increasing the total of
    capital authorized for share repurchases and dividends in 2006
    to $1.55 billion.

We paid $1,072 million for share repurchases in 2006, as
    compared with $706 million in 2005 and $496 million in
    2004. We repurchased approximately 31 million,
    25 million and 17 million shares of our common stock
    in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We currently expect to
    continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation
    program discussed above.

We paid an aggregate of $476 million in cash dividends
    during 2006 compared with $449 million in 2005 and
    $432 million in 2004. The increase in dividend payments is
    due to annual increases in our per share dividend payment, which
    increased from a quarterly per share dividend of $0.1875 in
    2004, to $0.20 in 2005 and to $0.22 in 2006. The impact of the

year-over-year

increases in the per share dividend has been partially offset by
    a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares as a result
    of our share repurchase program. In December 2006, the Board of
    Directors announced that it expects future quarterly dividend
    payments will be $0.24 per share. All future dividend
    declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors,
    and depend on various factors, including our net earnings,
    financial condition, cash required for future prospects and
    other factors the Board may deem relevant.

Net debt repayments were $500 million in 2006,
    $11 million in 2005 and $386 million in 2004. The
    following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and
    debt repayments made during each year (in millions):

The exercise of common stock options and warrants and the
    related excess tax benefits generated a total of
    $340 million of financing cash inflows during 2006,
    compared with $129 million in 2005 and $193 million in
    2004. We believe the significant increase in stock option and
    warrant exercises in 2006 is due to the substantial increase in
    the market value of our common stock during 2006. The
    accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock options in December
    2005 also resulted in increased cash proceeds from stock option
    exercises because the acceleration made additional options
    available for exercise. As discussed above, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 resulted in
    the classification of tax savings provided by equity-based
    compensation as a financing cash inflow rather than an operating
    cash inflow beginning in the first quarter of 2006. This change
    in accounting increased cash flows from financing activities by
    $45 million in 2006.

We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely.
    As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been
    included in the above table. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    these contingencies.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated
    entities as discussed in the

Guarantees

section of
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our
    third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to
    support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations.
    These arrangements have not materially affected our financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity during the year
    ended December 31, 2006 nor are they expected to have a
    material impact on our future financial position, results of
    operations or liquidity.

Seasonal
    Trends and Inflation

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
    during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
    and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
    trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
    that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
    the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005, can actually
    increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for
    several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
    Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
    months, when electrical demand is generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
    fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we
    believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near
    future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on
    our results of operations. However, management’s estimates
    associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have,
    an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental
    remediation liabilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

FIN 48 —
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109)

(“FIN 48”),
    which clarifies the relevant criteria and approach for the
    recognition, de-recognition and measurement of uncertain tax
    positions. FIN 48 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of
    FIN 48 to have a material impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently in the process
    of assessing the provisions of SFAS No. 157 and
    determining how this framework for measuring fair value will
    affect our current accounting policies and procedures and our
    financial statements. We have not determined whether the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact
    on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market
    risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency
    rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use
    derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our
    derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that
    provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no
    multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2006, all of
    our derivative transactions were related to



actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain
    transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting. We are
    exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our
    derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative
    positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the
    creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either
    consider credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to
    support their performance.

We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market
    rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk
    sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are
    inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical
    set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary
    significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market
    movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions
    and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity
    analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative
    of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the
    assumed market rate movements.

Interest Rate Exposure.

Our exposure to market
    risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt
    obligations, which are primarily denominated in
    U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to
    manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations,
    which directly impacts variability in interest costs. An
    instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates
    across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have
    decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate
    swap positions by approximately $460 million at
    December 31, 2006 and $480 million at
    December 31, 2005. This analysis does not reflect the
    effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items,
    such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would
    have on interest expense and cash payments for interest.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have
    $377 million and $460 million of assets held in
    restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included
    within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    These assets are generally restricted for future capital
    expenditures and closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are,
    therefore, invested in high quality, liquid instruments
    including money market accounts and U.S. government agency
    debt securities. Because of the short terms to maturity of these
    investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair
    value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

Currency Rate Exposure.

From time to time, we
    have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of
    currency translation on cash flows of intercompany
    Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign
    currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial
    position or results of operations for the periods presented. In
    addition, a change in foreign currency rates would not
    significantly affect our fair value positions.

Commodities Price Exposure.

We market recycled
    products such as wastepaper, aluminum and glass from our
    material recovery facilities. We have entered into commodity
    swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from
    a portion of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a
    floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed
    period of time. With regard to our option agreements, we have
    purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via
    synthetic floors (put options) and price protection on certain
    wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options).
    Additionally, we have entered into collars (combination of a put
    and call option) with financial institutions in which we receive
    the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a
    specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value
    of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings,
    as required. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk
    management policy, which governs the type of instruments that
    may be used. The fair value position of our commodity
    derivatives would decrease by approximately $5 million at
    December 31, 2006 and by approximately $10 million at
    December 31, 2005 if there were an instantaneous 10%
    increase across all commodities and applicable yield curves.

See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further discussion of the use of and accounting for
    derivative instruments.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal
    controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to
    (i) the reliability of our financial reporting;
    (ii) the reliability of the preparation and presentation of
    the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States; and (iii) the safeguarding of assets from
    unauthorized use or disposition.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Through this
    evaluation, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our
    internal controls. There are inherent limitations in the
    effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
    reporting; however, based on our evaluation, we have concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of December 31, 2006.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on
    management’s assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting, which is included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Waste Management, Inc. at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” and, effective
    March 31, 2004, the Company adopted the remaining portion
    of Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation
    No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities (revised December 2003) — an Interpretation
    of ARB No. 51.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ERNST & YOUNG LLP

February 14, 2007



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Waste Management, Inc. maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Waste Management, Inc.’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Waste
    Management, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on the
    COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Waste Management, Inc.
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years
    Ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

1.

Business

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
    our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
    variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary (See Note 19). Waste
    Management, Inc. is a holding company and all operations are
    conducted by subsidiaries. When the terms “the
    Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”
    are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste
    Management, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated
    variable interest entities. When we use the term
    “WMI,” we are referring only to the parent holding
    company.

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and

waste-to-energy

services. In providing these services, we actively pursue
    projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive
    difference for our environment, including recovering and
    processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into
    a renewable energy source. Our customers include commercial,
    industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste
    management companies, electric utilities and governmental
    entities.

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through six
    operating Groups, of which four are organized by geographic area
    and two are organized by function. The geographic Groups include
    our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, and the two
    functional Groups are our Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to-energy

services, and our Recycling Group. We also provide additional
    waste management services that are not managed through our six
    Groups, which are presented in this report as “Other.”
    Refer to Note 20 for additional information related to our
    operating segments.

Accounting
    Changes and Reclassifications

Accounting
    Changes

SFAS No. 123(R) —
    Share-Based Payment

On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised
    2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which requires
    compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based
    payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award
    at the date of grant. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using
    the modified prospective method, which results in (i) the
    recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based awards granted or
    modified after December 31, 2005 and (ii) the
    recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”) for all
    unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption. Under this
    transition method, the results of operations of prior periods
    have not been restated. Accordingly, we will continue to provide
    pro forma financial information for periods prior to
    January 1, 2006 to illustrate the effect on net income and
    earnings per share of applying the fair value recognition
    provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Through December 31, 2005, as permitted by
    SFAS No. 123, we accounted for equity-based
    compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees

, as amended (“APB
    No. 25”). Under APB No. 25, we recognized
    compensation expense based on an award’s intrinsic value.
    For stock options, which were the primary form of equity-based
    awards we granted through December 31, 2004, this meant we
    recognized no compensation expense in connection with the
    grants, as the exercise price of the options was equal to the
    fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and
    all other provisions were fixed. As discussed below, beginning
    in 2005, restricted stock units and performance share units
    became the primary form of equity-based compensation awarded
    under our long-term incentive plans. For restricted stock units,
    intrinsic value is equal to the market value of our common stock
    on the date of grant. For performance share units, APB
    No. 25 required “variable accounting,” which
    resulted in the recognition of compensation expense based on the
    intrinsic value of each award at the end of each reporting
    period until such time that the number of shares to be issued
    and all other provisions are fixed.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The most significant difference between the fair value
    approaches prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and
    SFAS No. 123(R) and the intrinsic value method
    prescribed by APB No. 25 relates to the recognition of
    compensation expense for stock option awards based on their
    grant date fair value. Under SFAS No. 123, we
    estimated the fair value of stock option grants using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following table
    reflects the pro forma impact on net income and earnings per
    common share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
    of accounting for our equity-based compensation using
    SFAS No. 123 (in millions, except per share amounts):

In December 2005, the Management Development and Compensation
    Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of
    the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our
    stock incentive plans, effective December 28, 2005. The
    decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options
    was made primarily to reduce the non-cash compensation expense
    that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a
    result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). We estimated that
    the acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of
    cumulative pre-tax compensation charges that would have been
    recognized during 2006, 2007 and 2008 as the stock options would
    have continued to vest. We recognized a $2 million pre-tax
    charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005
    as a result of the acceleration, but do not expect to recognize
    future compensation expense for the accelerated options under
    SFAS No. 123(R). Total equity-based compensation
    expense per SFAS No. 123, net of tax benefit as
    presented in the table above, includes a pro forma charge of
    $41 million, net of tax benefit, for the December 2005
    accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options.

Additionally, as a result of changes in accounting required by
    SFAS No. 123(R) and a desire to design our long-term
    incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to
    operating and market performance, the Management



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Development and Compensation Committee approved a substantial
    change in the form of awards that we grant. Beginning in 2005,
    annual stock option grants were replaced with either
    (i) grants of restricted stock units and performance share
    units or (ii) an enhanced cash compensation award. Stock
    option grants in connection with new hires and promotions were
    replaced with grants of restricted stock units. The terms of
    restricted stock units and performance share units granted
    during 2006 are summarized in Note 15.

As a result of the acceleration of the vesting of stock options
    and the replacement of future awards of stock options with other
    forms of equity awards, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 did not
    significantly affect our accounting for equity-based
    compensation or our net income for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. We do not currently expect this change
    in accounting to significantly impact our future results of
    operations. However, we do expect equity-based compensation
    expense to increase over the next three years because of the
    incremental expense that will be recognized each year as
    additional awards are granted.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we included
    all tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation as
    operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires any reduction in taxes
    payable resulting from tax deductions that exceed the recognized
    tax benefit associated with compensation expense (excess tax
    benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. We included
    $45 million of excess tax benefits in our cash flows from
    financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006
    that would have been classified as an operating cash flow if we
    had not been required to adopt SFAS No. 123(R). During
    the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, excess tax
    benefits improved our operating cash flows by approximately
    $17 million and $37 million, respectively.

SFAS No. 158 —
    Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS No. 158
    requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
    status of their defined benefit pension and other
    post-retirement plans as an asset or liability and to recognize
    changes in that funded status through comprehensive income in
    the year in which the changes occur. As required, the Company
    adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31,
    2006, we recorded a liability and a corresponding deferred loss
    adjustment to “Accumulated other comprehensive income”
    of $2 million related to the previously unaccrued liability
    balance associated with our defined benefit pension and other
    post-retirement plans. The December 31, 2006 net
    increase of $1 million in “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” attributable to the underfunded
    status of our post-retirement plans is associated with the net
    impact of adjustments to increase deferred tax assets by
    $3 million, partially offset by the additional
    $2 million related to liabilities recorded.

FIN 46(R) —
    Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

Non-special purpose variable interest
    entities

— On March 31, 2004, our application
    of the FASB’s Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December
    2003) — an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

,
    (“FIN 46(R)”) to non-special purpose type
    variable interest entities resulted in the consolidation of
    certain trusts established to support the performance of
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities.
    Upon consolidating these entities, we recorded an increase in
    our net assets and a credit of $8 million, net of taxes, or
    $0.01 per diluted share, to “Cumulative effect of
    change in accounting principle.”

Reconsideration of a Variable Interest

— During
    2006, the debt of a previously consolidated variable interest
    entity was refinanced. As a result of the refinancing, our
    guarantee arrangement was also renegotiated, significantly
    reducing the value of our guarantee. We determined that the
    refinancing of the entity’s debt obligations and
    corresponding renegotiation of our guarantee represented
    significant changes in the entity that required reconsideration
    of the applicability of FIN 46(R). As a result of the
    reconsideration of our interest in this variable interest

entity, we concluded that we are no longer the primary
    beneficiary of this entity. Accordingly, in April 2006, we
    deconsolidated the entity. The deconsolidation of this entity
    did not materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for the periods presented.

See Note 19 for further discussion of variable interest
    entities.

Reclassifications

As a result of the increase in the significance of the impact of
    equity-based compensation on our financial statements, we have
    elected to separately identify the effects of these transactions
    within our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.
    We have made reclassifications in our Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity to conform prior year information with
    our current period presentation. The supplementary financial
    information included in this section has also been updated to
    reflect these changes. Certain other minor reclassifications
    have also been made to our prior period consolidated financial
    information in order to conform to the current year presentation.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of WMI, its wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we
    have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All
    material intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities in which we do not have a
    controlling financial interest are accounted for under either
    the equity method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.

Estimates
    and assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
    with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting
    for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset
    impairments, and self-insurance reserves and recoveries. Each of
    these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual
    results could differ materially from the estimates and
    assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial
    statements.

Cash
    and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit,
    certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment
    grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of
    three months or less.

Short-term
    investments available for use

We invest in auction rate securities and variable rate demand
    notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled
    maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The interest
    rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic
    marketing of the underlying securities through an auction
    process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate
    reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment in
    these securities, they have been classified as current assets in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, $184 million and $300 million of investments
    in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes have
    been included as a component of current “Other
    assets.” Gross purchases and sales of these investments are
    presented within “Cash flows from investing
    activities” in our Statements of Cash Flows.

Concentrations
    of credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term investments, investments held within our
    trust funds and escrow accounts, accounts receivable and
    derivative instruments. We control our exposure to credit risk
    associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets
    and other financial interests with a diverse group of
    credit-worthy financial institutions; (ii) holding
    high-quality financial instruments while limiting investments in
    any one instrument; and (iii) maintaining strict policies
    over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit
    limits and monitoring procedures, although generally we do not
    have collateral requirements. In addition, our overall credit
    risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the
    large number of geographically diverse customers we service. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, no single customer represented
    greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.

Trade
    and other receivables

Our receivables are recorded when billed or advanced and
    represent claims against third parties that will be settled in
    cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net
    realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful
    accounts based on historical collection trends, type of
    customer, such as municipal or non-municipal, the age of
    outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions. If
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific
    receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is
    given to the collectibility of those balances and the allowance
    is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are
    written-off when our internal collection efforts have been
    unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Also, we recognize
    interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable
    as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes.

Landfill
    accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize
    various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept
    waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land
    (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer
    property), permitting, excavation, liner material and
    installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest, and

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future
    costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities in accordance with
    SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

(“SFAS No. 143”) and its
    Interpretations. These costs are discussed below.

Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

—
    Following is a description of our asset retirement activities
    and our related accounting:

•

Final Capping

— Involves the installation of
    flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage
    and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill
    where total airspace capacity has been consumed. Final capping
    asset retirement obligations are recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific final
    capping event with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Each final capping event is accounted for as a discrete
    obligation and recorded as an asset and a liability based on
    estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated
    with each final capping event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the
    final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required),
    demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs
    incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but before the
    landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state
    regulatory agency. These costs are accrued as an asset
    retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of
    the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Closure obligations are accrued over the life of the
    landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows
    associated with performing closure activities.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Post-Closure

— Involves the maintenance and
    monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by
    the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to
    maintain and monitor landfill sites for a

30-year

period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an
    asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the
    life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the
    landfill asset. Post-closure obligations are accrued over the
    life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash
    flows associated with performing post-closure activities.

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from
    our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our
    estimates are based on our interpretation of current
    requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to
    approximate fair value under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 143. Absent quoted market prices, the
    estimate of fair value should be based on the best available
    information, including the results of present value techniques.
    In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our
    obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use
    historical experience, professional engineering judgment and
    quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the
    fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize
    these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract
    with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those
    instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the
    incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component
    of operating income when the work is performed.

Additionally, an estimate of fair value should also include the
    price that marketplace participants are able to receive for
    bearing the uncertainties inherent in these cash flows. However,
    when using discounted cash flow techniques, reliable estimates
    of market premiums may not be obtainable. In the waste industry,
    there is generally not a market for selling the responsibility
    for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations
    independent of selling the landfill in its entirety.
    Accordingly, we do not believe that it is possible to develop a
    methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium. We have
    excluded any such market risk premium from our determination of
    expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations.

Once we have determined the final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time
    of payment and discount those expected future costs back to
    present value. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, we inflated these costs in current dollars until the
    expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 2.5%. We
    discount these costs to present value using the credit-adjusted,
    risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred
    consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in
    expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated
    cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the
    current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the
    historical weighted-average rate of the recorded obligation. As
    a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to each
    individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted-average
    rate applicable to our asset retirement obligations at
    December 31, 2006 is between 6.00% and 7.25%, the range of
    the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rates effective since
    adopting SFAS No. 143 in 2003.

We record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity
    consumed through the current period. The fair value of final
    capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the
    airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the
    expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of
    closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our
    estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire
    landfill and the expected timing of each closure and
    post-closure activity. Because these obligations are measured at
    estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in
    the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure
    and post-closure activities could result in a material change in
    these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We
    assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our
    recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts
    change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or
    extent of future final capping and closure and post-closure
    activities typically result in both (i) a current
    adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset; and
    (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded
    prospectively over either the remaining capacity of the related
    discrete final capping event or the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace (as defined below) of the landfill.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Any changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the
    landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our
    amortization policy, which would generally result in
    amortization expense being recognized prospectively over the
    remaining capacity of the final capping event or the remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as
    appropriate. Changes in such estimates associated with airspace
    that has been fully utilized result in an adjustment to the
    recorded liability and landfill assets with an immediate
    corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace amortization
    expense.

During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the
    timing and cost of future final capping, closure and
    post-closure of fully utilized airspace resulted in
    $1 million, $13 million and $18 million in net
    credits to landfill airspace amortization expense, respectively,
    with the majority of these credits resulting from revised
    estimates associated with final capping changes. In managing our
    landfills, our engineers look for ways to reduce or defer our
    construction costs, including final capping costs. Most of the
    benefit recognized in these years was the result of concerted
    efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills
    allowing us to delay spending for final capping activities,
    landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final
    capping costs, or completed final capping construction that cost
    less than anticipated.

Interest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure
    liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and
    is recorded as final capping, closure and post-closure expense,
    which is included in “Operating” costs and expenses
    within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The
    amortizable basis of a landfill includes (i) amounts
    previously expended and capitalized; (ii) capitalized
    landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs;
    (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs
    required to develop the landfill site to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity; and (iv) projected asset retirement
    costs related to landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities.

Amortization is recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is
    calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis
    of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the
    corresponding asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do
    not own, but operate through operating or lease arrangements,
    the rate per ton is calculated based on the lesser of the
    contractual term of the underlying agreement or the life of the
    landfill.

We apply the following guidelines in determining a
    landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:

•

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently
    unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include
    airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally
    expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted
    within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received
    within five years. Second, we must believe the success of
    obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the
    following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 62 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2006, 14 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required
    approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of a lack of
    community or political support that could impede the expansion
    process. The remaining six landfills required approval mainly
    due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit
    application processes would not meet the one or five year
    requirements, generally due to state-specific permitting
    procedures.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined, an airspace utilization factor (AUF) is established
    to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in
    tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained
    from previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for
    settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will
    take into account several site-specific factors including
    current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected
    waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining,
    depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to moisture
    through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate. In
    addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a
    subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group. Our
    historical experience generally indicates that the impact of
    settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the
    landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its
    highest point under the permit requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement costs related to final capping, and closure and
    post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the
    landfill.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill
    amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream,
    geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the
    number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We
    then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us
    the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is
    received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton
    amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with
    each final capping event, for assets related to closure and
    post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or
    to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or
    higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the
    opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will
    receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is
    determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be
    considered in calculating the



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to
    recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the
    likelihood of receiving the expansion permit has become remote,
    the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are
    expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— We are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that
    existed before we acquired a site. Such liabilities include
    potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations,
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs
    directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such
    as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to
    the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with
    environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review
    and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our
    estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates
    and assumptions.

We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs.

There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the
    costs associated with the likely remedy of a site. In these
    cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our
    best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amounts that are the
    low ends of such ranges in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

,
    (“SFAS No. 5”) and its Interpretations. If
    we used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential
    liability would be approximately $190 million higher on a
    discounted basis than the $268 million recorded in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2006.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation of a
    particular site is inherently difficult and determining the
    method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number
    of assumptions be made. Our ultimate responsibility may differ
    materially from current estimates. It is possible that
    technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the
    results of environmental studies, the inability to identify
    other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the
    settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require
    us to record additional liabilities that could be material.
    Additionally, our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities
    could result in revisions that could cause upward or downward
    adjustments to income from operations. These adjustments could
    also be material in any given period.

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular
    environmental remediation liability and the timing of the
    payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in
    current dollars (by 2.5% at both December 31, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005) until the expected time of payment
    and discount the cost to present value using a risk-free
    discount rate, which is based on the rate for United States
    treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted average
    period until settlement of the underlying obligation. We
    determine the risk-free discount rate and the inflation rate on
    an annual basis unless interim changes would significantly
    impact our results of operations. As a result of an increase in
    our risk-free discount rate, which increased from 4.25% for 2005
    to 4.75% for 2006, we



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded a $6 million reduction in “Operating”
    expenses during the first quarter of 2006 and a corresponding
    decrease in environmental remediation liabilities. For remedial
    liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest
    accretion, based on the effective interest method, in
    “Operating” costs and expenses in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. The portion of our recorded
    environmental remediation liabilities that has never been
    subject to inflation or discounting as the amounts and timing of
    payments are not readily determinable was $55 million and
    $57 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Had we not discounted any portion of our
    environmental remediation liability, the amount recorded would
    have been increased by $41 million at December 31,
    2006 and $36 million at December 31, 2005.

Property
    and equipment (Exclusive of landfills discussed
    above)

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
    is provided over the estimated useful lives of these assets
    using the straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for
    our depreciable property and equipment. The estimated useful
    lives for significant property and equipment categories are as
    follows (in years):

We include capitalized costs associated with developing or
    obtaining internal-use software within furniture, fixtures and
    office equipment. These costs include external direct costs of
    materials and services used in developing or obtaining the
    software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees
    directly associated with the software development project. As of
    December 31, 2006, capitalized costs for software placed in
    service, net of accumulated depreciation, were $68 million.
    In addition, our furniture, fixtures and office equipment as of
    December 31, 2006 includes $62 million for costs
    incurred for software under development.

When property and equipment are retired, sold or otherwise
    disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
    from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
    results of operations as offsets or increases to operating
    expense for the period.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill, transfer station or

waste-to-energy

facility and equipment such as compactors. Our leases have
    varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase options,
    escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations
    that we consider in determining minimum lease payments. The
    leases are classified as either operating leases or capital
    leases, as appropriate.

Operating leases

— The majority of our leases
    are operating leases. This classification generally can be
    attributed to either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease
    payments as a result of real property lease obligations that
    vary based on the volume of waste we receive or process or
    (ii) minimum lease terms that are much shorter than the
    assets’ economic useful lives. Management expects that in
    the normal course of business our operating leases will be
    renewed, replaced by other leases, or replaced with fixed asset
    expenditures. Our rent expense during each of the last three
    years and our future minimum operating lease payments for each
    of the next five years, for which we are contractually obligated
    as of December 31, 2006, are disclosed in Note 10.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Capital leases

— Assets under capital leases
    are capitalized using interest rates appropriate at the
    inception of each lease and are amortized over either the useful
    life of the asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a
    straight-line basis. The present value of the related lease
    payments is recorded as a debt obligation. Our future minimum
    annual capital lease payments are included in our total future
    debt obligations as disclosed in Note 7.

Business
    combinations

We account for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination based on fair value estimates as of the
    date of acquisition. These estimates are revised during the
    allocation period as necessary if, and when, information
    regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and
    quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation
    period generally does not exceed one year. To the extent
    contingencies such as preacquisition environmental matters,
    litigation and related legal fees are resolved or settled during
    the allocation period, such items are included in the revised
    allocation of the purchase price. After the allocation period,
    the effect of changes in such contingencies is included in
    results of operations in the periods in which the adjustments
    are determined.

In certain business combinations, we agree to pay additional
    amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired
    businesses of certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue
    levels, targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for
    expanded landfill airspace. Contingent payments, when incurred,
    are recorded as purchase price adjustments or compensation
    expense, as appropriate, based on the nature of each contingent
    payment. Refer to the

Guarantees

section of Note 10
    for additional information related to these contingent
    obligations.

Assets

held-for-sale

During our operations review processes, we, from time to time,
    identify under-performing operations. We assess these operations
    for opportunities to improve their performance. A possible
    conclusion of this review may be that offering the related
    assets for sale to others is in our best interests.
    Additionally, we continually review our real estate portfolio
    and identify any surplus property.

We classify these assets as

held-for-sale

when they meet the following criteria: (i) management,
    having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to
    sell the assets; (ii) the assets are available for
    immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to
    conditions that are usual and customary for the sale of such
    assets; (iii) we are actively searching for a buyer;
    (iv) the assets are being marketed at a price that is
    reasonable in relation to their current fair value;
    (v) actions necessary to complete the plan indicate that it
    is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or
    the plan will be withdrawn; and (vi) the sale is probable
    and the transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a
    completed sale within one year.

These assets are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount
    or their fair value less the estimated cost to sell and are
    included within current “Other assets” within our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We continue to review our
    classification of assets

held-for-sale

to ensure they meet our

held-for-sale

criteria.

Discontinued
    operations

Quarterly, we analyze our operations that have been divested or
    classified as

held-for-sale

in order to determine if they qualify for discontinued
    operations accounting. Only operations that qualify as a
    component of an entity (“Component”) under generally
    accepted accounting principles can be included in discontinued
    operations. Only Components where we do not have significant
    continuing involvement with the divested operations would
    qualify for discontinued operations accounting. For our
    purposes, continuing involvement would include continuing to
    receive waste at our landfill,

waste-to-energy

facility or recycling facility from a divested hauling operation
    or transfer station or continuing to dispose of waste at a
    divested landfill or transfer station. After completing our



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

analysis at December 31, 2006, we determined that the
    operations that qualify for discontinued operations accounting
    are not material to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value
    of the net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

, we do not amortize goodwill. As discussed in the

Asset impairments

section below, we assess our goodwill
    for impairment at least annually.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts,
    customer lists, covenants

not-to-compete,

licenses, permits (other than landfill permits, as all landfill
    related intangible assets are combined with landfill tangible
    assets and amortized using our landfill amortization policy) and
    other contracts. Other intangible assets are recorded at cost
    and are amortized using either a 150% declining balance approach
    or on a straight-line basis as we determine appropriate.
    Customer contracts and customer lists are generally amortized
    over seven to ten years. Covenants

not-to-compete

are amortized over the term of the non-compete covenant, which
    is generally two to five years. Licenses, permits and other
    contracts are amortized over the definitive terms of the related
    agreements. If the underlying agreement does not contain
    definitive terms and the useful life is determined to be
    indefinite, the asset is not amortized.

Asset
    impairments

We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Typical indicators that
    an asset may be impaired include:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset
    group;

•

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition;

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group,
    including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

•

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
    originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
    long-lived asset;

•

Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a
    history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
    use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
    asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
    life.

If any of these or other indicators occur, the asset is reviewed
    to determine whether there has been an impairment. An impairment
    loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying amount
    and fair value of the asset. If significant events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or
    asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of
    recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or
    asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If
    cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for
    a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has
    occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the
    projected cash flow. If the carrying values are in excess of
    undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any
    impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset
    group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either
    an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis
    of the asset or asset group or an actual third-party valuation.
    If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be
    less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an
    impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the
    period that the impairment

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

indicator occurs and is included in the “(Income) expense
    from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items”
    line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and
    projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There
    are other considerations for impairments of landfills and
    goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain of the indicators listed
    above require significant judgment and understanding of the
    waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the book value of goodwill to its implied fair value.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting
    the fair value of each of our reporting unit’s
    (Group’s) identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair
    value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting
    unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being
    initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be
    performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes
    in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would
    indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill
    has been impaired.

Restricted
    trust and escrow accounts

As of December 31, 2006, our restricted trust and escrow
    accounts consist principally of (i) funds deposited in
    connection with landfill closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation obligations; (ii) funds held in trust for the
    construction of various facilities; and (iii) funds held in
    trust for the repayment of our debt obligations. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $377 million and
    $460 million, respectively, of restricted trust and escrow
    accounts, which are generally included in long-term “Other
    assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Closure, post-closure and environmental remediation
    funds

— At several of our landfills, we provide
    financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted escrow
    accounts or trust funds for purposes of settling closure,
    post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. Balances
    maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will
    fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements;
    (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual
    arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of funds for qualifying
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities;
    (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills; and
    (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments
    held in the trust fund or escrow account.

Tax-exempt bond funds

— We obtain funds from
    the issuance of industrial revenue bonds for the construction of
    collection and disposal facilities and for equipment necessary
    to provide waste management services. Proceeds from these
    arrangements are directly deposited into trust accounts, and we
    do not have the ability to use the funds in regular operating
    activities. Accordingly, these borrowings are excluded from
    financing activities in our Statement of Cash Flows. At the time
    our construction and equipment expenditures have been documented
    and approved by the applicable bond trustee, the funds are
    released and we receive cash. These amounts are reported in the
    Statement of Cash Flows as an investing activity when the cash
    is released from the trust funds. Generally, the funds are fully
    expended within a few years of the debt issuance. When the debt
    matures, we repay our obligation with cash on hand and the debt
    repayments are included as a financing activity in the Statement
    of Cash Flows.

Our trust fund assets funded by industrial revenue bonds and
    held for future capital expenditures are invested in
    U.S. government agency debt securities with maturities
    ranging from less than one year to three years. For the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, our realized and
    unrealized gains on these investments have not been material to
    our results of operations and financial position.

Debt service funds

— Funds are held in trust to
    meet future principal and interest payments required under
    certain of our tax-exempt project bonds.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Derivative
    financial instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk
    associated with fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices
    and foreign currency exchange rates. We use interest rate swaps
    to maintain a strategic portion of our debt obligations at
    variable, market-driven interest rates. In prior periods, we
    have entered into interest rate derivatives in anticipation of
    our senior note issuances to effectively lock in a fixed
    interest rate. We have entered into commodity derivatives,
    including swaps and options, to mitigate some of the risk
    associated with our Recycling Group’s transactions, which
    can be significantly affected by market prices for recyclable
    commodities. Foreign currency exchange rate derivatives are
    often used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates
    for anticipated cash transactions between us and our Canadian
    subsidiaries.

We obtain current valuations of our interest rate hedging
    instruments from third-party pricing models to account for the
    fair value of outstanding interest rate derivatives. We estimate
    the future prices of commodity fiber products based upon traded
    exchange market prices and broker price quotations to derive the
    current fair value of commodity derivatives. The fair value of
    our foreign currency exchange rate derivatives is based on
    quoted market prices. The estimated fair values of derivatives
    used to hedge risks fluctuate over time and should be viewed in
    relation to the underlying hedged transaction and the overall
    management of our exposure to fluctuations in the underlying
    risks. The fair value of derivatives is included in other
    current assets, other long-term assets, accrued liabilities or
    other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. Any ineffectiveness
    present in either fair value or cash flow hedges is recognized
    immediately in earnings without offset. There was no significant
    ineffectiveness in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

•

Cash flow hedges

— The effective portion of
    those derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for accounting
    purposes is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive
    income” within the equity section of our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Upon termination, the associated balance in
    other comprehensive income is amortized to earnings as the
    hedged cash flows occur.

•

Fair value hedges

— The offsetting amounts for
    those derivatives designated as fair value hedges for accounting
    purposes are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of
    the hedged items. Upon termination, this carrying value
    adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of
    the hedged item.

As of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the net fair value
    and earnings impact of our commodity and foreign currency
    derivatives were immaterial to our financial position and
    results of operations. As further discussed in Note 7, our
    use of interest rate derivatives to manage our fixed to floating
    rate position has had a material impact on our operating cash
    flows, carrying value of debt and interest expense during these
    periods.

Self-insurance
    reserves and recoveries

We have retained a portion of the risks related to our health
    and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’
    compensation insurance programs. The exposure for unpaid claims
    and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported
    losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external
    actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and historical
    trends and data. The gross estimated liability associated with
    settling unpaid claims is included in “Accrued
    liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets if expected
    to be settled within one year, or otherwise is included in
    long-term “Other liabilities.” Estimated insurance
    recoveries related to recorded liabilities are reflected as
    current “Other receivables” or long-term “Other
    assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets when we believe
    that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Foreign
    currency

We have significant operations in Canada. The functional
    currency of our Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars. The
    assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated
    to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate during the
    period. The resulting translation difference is reflected as a
    component of comprehensive income.

Revenue
    recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste
    collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services and the
    sale of recycled commodities, electricity and steam. The fees
    charged for our services are generally defined in our service
    agreements and vary based on contract specific terms such as
    frequency of service, weight, volume and the general market
    factors influencing a region’s rates. We generally
    recognize revenue as services are performed or products are
    delivered. For example, revenue typically is recognized as waste
    is collected, tons are received at our landfills or transfer
    stations, recycling commodities are delivered or as kilowatts
    are delivered to a customer by a

waste-to-energy

facility or independent power production plant.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services
    include, among others, certain residential contracts that are
    billed on a quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance
    billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as
    revenue in the period service is provided.

Capitalized
    interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development,
    including remaining permitted landfill projects and landfill
    expansion projects, and on certain assets under construction,
    including internal-use software, operating landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, total interest costs
    were $563 million, $505 million and $477 million,
    respectively, of which $18 million for 2006,
    $9 million for 2005 and $22 million for 2004, were
    capitalized, primarily for landfill construction costs. The
    capitalization of interest for operating landfills is based on
    the costs incurred on discrete landfill cell construction
    projects that are expected to exceed $500,000 and require over
    60 days to construct. In addition to the direct cost of the
    cell construction project, the calculation of capitalized
    interest includes an allocated portion of the common landfill
    site costs. The common landfill site costs include the
    development costs of a landfill project or the purchase price of
    an operating landfill, and the ongoing infrastructure costs
    benefiting the landfill over its useful life. These costs are
    amortized to expense in a manner consistent with other landfill
    site costs. The decline in the amount of interest capitalized in
    2005 results from fewer projects on which interest was
    capitalized and an adjustment in the second quarter of 2005
    reducing amounts previously capitalized to a large capital
    project.

Income
    taxes

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the
    financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The
    deferred income tax provision represents the change during the
    reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
    Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards
    and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant
    judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of
    deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when,
    despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
    supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged
    and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change,
    we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.

Contingent
    liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with
    respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. We are party to pending or threatened
    legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters in various
    jurisdictions. It is not always possible to predict the outcome
    of litigation, as it is subject to many uncertainties.
    Additionally, it is not always possible for management to make a
    meaningful estimate of the potential loss or range of loss
    associated with such litigation.

Supplemental
    cash flow information

Non-cash investing and financing activities are excluded from
    the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, non-cash activities
    included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal
    payments made directly from trust funds, of $157 million,
    $201 million and $283 million, respectively. In 2004,
    non-cash financing activities also included the issuance of
    $118.5 million of debt in return for our equity investment
    in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. These
    investments are discussed in detail in Note 8.

On December 15, 2005, we declared our first quarterly cash
    dividend for 2006. The first quarter 2006 dividend was
    $0.22 per common share and was paid on March 24, 2006
    to stockholders of record on March 6, 2006. As of
    December 31, 2005, $122 million had been accrued for
    this dividend declaration. As the dividend payments did not
    occur until March 2006 they were excluded from our “Net
    cash used in financing activities” in our Consolidated

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual
    goodwill impairment tests in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Additionally,
    we did not encounter any events or changes in circumstances that
    indicated that an impairment was more likely than not during
    interim periods in 2006, 2005 or 2004. However, there can be no
    assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the
    future.

October 2009. We also have a $350 million letter of credit
    facility that matures in December 2008 and three letter of
    credit and term loan agreements for an aggregate of
    $295 million maturing at various points from 2008 through
    2013. Our revolving credit and letter of credit facilities are
    currently being used to support letters of credit to support our
    bonding and financial assurance needs. Our letters of credit
    generally have terms providing for automatic renewal after one
    year. In the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of
    credit, the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit
    provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining
    term of the respective agreement or facility. Through
    December 31, 2006, we had not experienced any unreimbursed
    draws on letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding
    under our revolving credit or letter of credit facilities, and
    we had unused and available credit capacity of
    $1,103 million under the facilities discussed above. The

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
    Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility
    agreement under which we could borrow up to Canadian
    $410 million. The agreement was entered into to facilitate
    WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from
    its Canadian subsidiaries (See Note 8).

As of December 31, 2006, we had $313 million of
    principal ($308 million net of discount) outstanding under
    this credit facility. Advances under the facility do not accrue
    interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we
    initially received were for the principal amount of the advances
    net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the
    advance, and the debt was initially recorded based on the net
    proceeds received. The advances have a weighted average
    effective interest rate of 4.8%, which is being amortized to
    interest expense with a corresponding increase in our recorded
    debt obligation using the effective interest method. During the
    year ended December 31, 2006, we increased the carrying
    value of the debt for the recognition of $15 million of
    interest expense. A total of $47 million of advances under
    the facility matured during 2006 and were repaid with available
    cash. Accounting for changes in the Canadian currency
    translation rate did not significantly affect the carrying value
    of these borrowings during 2006.

Our outstanding advances mature less than one year from the date
    of issuance, but may be renewed under the terms of the facility.
    While we may elect to renew portions of our outstanding advances
    under the terms of the facility, we currently expect to repay
    our borrowings under the facility within one year with available
    cash. Accordingly, these borrowings are classified as current in
    our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of
    December 31, 2005, we had expected to repay
    $86 million of outstanding advances with available cash and
    renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility.
    Based on our expectations at that time, we classified
    $86 million as current and $254 million as long-term
    in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Senior notes

— On October 15, 2006,
    $300 million of 7% senior notes matured and were
    repaid with cash on hand. We have $300 million of 7.125%
    senior notes that mature in October 2007 that we currently
    expect to repay with available cash. Accordingly, this borrowing
    is classified as current as of December 31, 2006.

Tax-exempt bonds

— We actively issue tax-exempt
    bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing. We issued
    $159 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2006. The proceeds
    from these debt issuances may only be used for the specific
    purpose for which the money was raised, which is generally to
    finance expenditures for landfill

construction and development, equipment, vehicles and facilities
    in support of our operations. Proceeds from bond issues are held
    in trust until such time as we incur qualified expenditures, at
    which time we are reimbursed from the trust funds. We issue both
    fixed and floating rate obligations. Interest rates on floating
    rate bonds are re-set on a weekly basis and the underlying bonds
    are supported by letters of credit. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, $9 million of our tax-exempt bonds
    matured and were repaid with either available cash or debt
    service funds.

As of December 31, 2006, $255 million of fixed rate
    tax-exempt bonds are subject to repricing within the next twelve
    months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the
    re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can
    be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not
    backed by letters of credit supported by our long-term
    facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event
    of a failed re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current
    obligation for financial reporting purposes. However, these
    bonds have been classified as long-term in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. The classification
    of these obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to
    refinance the borrowings with other long-term financings in the
    event of a failed re-offering and our ability, in the event
    other sources of long-term financing are not available, to use
    our five-year revolving credit facility.

In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we have
    $606 million of tax-exempt bonds that are remarketed either
    daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a
    variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket
    the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us.
    These bonds are supported by letters of credit guaranteeing
    repayment of the bonds in this event. We classified these
    borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 2006 because the borrowings are supported by
    letters of credit primarily issued under our five-year revolving
    credit facility, which is long-term.

Tax-exempt project bonds

— Tax-exempt project
    bonds have been used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the
    development of

waste-to-energy

facilities. These facilities are integral to the local
    communities they serve, and, as such, are supported by long-term
    contracts with multiple municipalities. The bonds generally have
    periodic amortizations that are supported by the cash flow of
    each specific facility being financed. As of December 31,
    2006, we had $46 million of tax-exempt project bonds that
    are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to
    effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent
    is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can
    put the bonds to us. These bonds are supported by letters of
    credit guaranteeing repayment of the bonds in this event. We
    classified these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006 because the borrowings
    are supported by letters of credit primarily issued under our
    five-year revolving credit facility, which is long-term. During
    the year ended December 31, 2006, we repaid
    $51 million of our tax-exempt project bonds with either
    available cash or debt service funds.

Capital leases and other

— The decrease in
    our capital leases and other debt obligations in 2006 is
    primarily related to (i) the repayment of various
    borrowings upon their scheduled maturities and (ii) the
    deconsolidation of a variable interest entity during the second
    quarter of 2006.

Scheduled debt and capital lease payments

— The
    schedule of anticipated debt and capital lease payments
    (including the current portion) for the next five years is
    presented below (in millions). Our recorded debt and capital
    lease obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with
    discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate
    hedging activities, which have been excluded here because they
    will not result in cash payments.

— Our debt balances are generally

    project bonds outstanding at December 31, 2006 that were
    issued by certain subsidiaries within our Wheelabrator Group.
    These bonds are secured by the related subsidiaries’ assets
    that have a carrying value of $473 million and the related
    subsidiaries’ future revenue. Additionally, our
    consolidated variable interest entities have $43 million of
    outstanding borrowings that are collateralized by certain of
    their assets. These assets have a carrying value of
    $380 million as of December 31, 2006. See Note 19
    for further discussion.

Debt
    Covenants

Our revolving credit facility and certain other financing
    agreements contain financial covenants. The most restrictive of
    these financial covenants are contained in our revolving credit
    facility. The following table summarizes the requirements of
    these financial covenants and the results of the calculation, as

Our revolving credit facility and senior notes also contain
    certain restrictions intended to monitor our level of
    indebtedness, types of investments and net worth. We monitor our
    compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they
    significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or
    financing arrangements typical for our business. As of
    December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the covenants
    and restrictions under all of our debt agreements.

Interest
    rate swaps

We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio
    principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a
    desired position of fixed and floating rate debt. As of
    December 31, 2006, the interest payments on
    $2.4 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to
    variable rates, allowing us to maintain approximately 64% of our
    debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 36% of our debt
    at variable interest rates. We do not use interest rate
    derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Our significant
    interest rate swap agreements that were outstanding as of

(a)

At December 31, 2006, $37 million (on a pre-tax basis)
    of the carrying value of debt associated with terminated swap
    agreements is scheduled to be reclassified as a credit to
    interest expense over the next twelve months. Approximately
    $41 million (on a pre-tax basis) of the December 31,
    2005 balance was reclassified into earnings during 2006.

Interest rate swap agreements increased net interest expense by
    $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and
    reduced net interest expense by $39 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 and $90 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2004. The significant decline in the
    benefit recognized as a result of our interest rate swap
    agreements is largely attributable to the increase in short-term
    market interest rates, which drive our periodic interest
    obligations under these agreements. The significant terms of the
    interest rate contracts and the underlying debt instruments are
    identical and therefore no ineffectiveness has been realized.

Interest
    rate locks

We have entered into cash flow hedges to secure underlying
    interest rates in anticipation of senior note issuances. These
    hedging agreements resulted in a deferred loss, net of taxes, of
    $28 million at December 31, 2006 and $32 million
    at December 31, 2005, which is included in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” As of
    December 31, 2006, $6 million (on a pre-tax basis) is
    scheduled to be reclassified into interest expense over the next
    twelve months.

Non-conventional fuel tax credits

— The impact
    of non-conventional fuel tax credits has been derived from
    methane gas projects at our landfills and our investments in two
    coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities (the
    “Facilities”), which are discussed in more detail
    below. The fuel generated from our landfills and the Facilities
    qualifies for tax credits through 2007 pursuant to
    Section 45K (formerly Section 29, but re-designated as
    Section 45K effective for years ending after
    December 31, 2005) of the Internal Revenue Code. These
    tax credits are phased-out if the price of crude oil exceeds an
    annual average price threshold determined by the
    U.S. Internal Revenue Service. In 2006, we have developed
    our estimate of the phase out of 36% of Section 45K credits
    using market information for crude oil prices as of
    December 31, 2006. We did not experience any phase-out of
    Section 45K tax credits in 2005 or 2004.

In 2004, we acquired minority ownership interests in the
    Facilities, which results in the recognition of our pro-rata
    share of the Facilities’ losses, the amortization of our
    investments, and additional expense associated with other
    estimated obligations all being recorded as “Equity in net
    losses of unconsolidated entities” within our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. We recognize these losses in the
    period in which the tax credits are generated. As

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discussed above, our effective tax rate and equity losses
    associated with our investments in these unconsolidated entities
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 include the effects of
    a partial phase-out of Section 45K credits generated during
    2006. Although we currently project that we will not be able to
    recognize 36% of the tax credits generated during 2006, we have
    been required to fund 100% of our pro-rata portion of the
    Facilities’ losses and production costs for 2006
    operations. Amounts paid to the Facilities for which we do not
    ultimately realize a tax benefit are refundable to us, subject
    to certain limitations. Our 2006 effective tax rate and equity
    losses also reflect the impact of the temporary suspension of
    operations at the Facilities, which occurred from May 2006 to
    late September 2006. The operations of the Facilities were
    suspended in order to minimize operating losses as a result of
    the expected phase-out of tax credits generated during 2006. For
    quarterly periods that the Facilities’ operations are
    producing below established production levels, our obligations
    associated with funding the entities’ operations may be
    deferred for a period of up to four quarters.

(a)

For the year ended December 31, 2006, our “Equity in
    net losses of unconsolidated entities” includes
    (i) the recognition of expense for our estimate of
    contractual obligations associated with the Facilities’
    operations during 2006 based on a 36% phase-out of
    Section 45K credits and the temporary suspension of
    operations discussed above, which was partially offset by
    (ii) a cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately
    reflect our

life-to-date

obligations to fund the costs of operating the Facilities and
    the value of our investment. This cumulative adjustment was
    recorded during the second quarter of 2006. We have determined
    that the recognition of the cumulative adjustment was not
    material to our financial statements presented herein.

(b)

The benefit from income taxes attributable to the Facilities
    includes tax credits of $47 million, $99 million and
    $88 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

The equity losses and associated tax benefits would not have
    been incurred if we had not acquired the minority ownership
    interests in the Facilities. If the tax credits generated by the
    Facilities were no longer allowable under Section 45K of
    the Internal Revenue Code, we could cease making payments in the
    period in which that determination is made and not incur
    additional losses.

The tax credits generated by our landfills are provided by our
    Renewable Energy Program, under which we develop, operate and
    promote the beneficial use of landfill gas. Our recorded taxes
    include benefits of $24 million, $34 million, and
    $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively, from tax credits generated by our
    landfill

gas-to-energy

projects. The tax benefits from our landfills were reduced in
    2006 due to the estimated phase-out of 36% of Section 45K
    credits.

Tax audit settlements

— During 2006 we
    completed the IRS audit for the years 2002 and 2003. The
    settlement of the IRS audit, as well as other state and foreign
    tax audit matters, resulted in a reduction in income tax expense
    (excluding the effects of related interest income) of
    $149 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for 2006. Our
    2006 income also increased by $14 million, or
    $9 million net of tax, principally due to interest income
    from these settlements. The IRS audits for the tax years 1989 to
    2001 were completed during 2005, resulting in net tax benefits
    of $398 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. During
    2004, we realized $101 million in tax benefits, or $0.17
    per

diluted share, related to audit settlements as well as
    $46 million in interest income, or $28 million net of
    tax, as a result of those settlements.

The reduction in income taxes recognized is primarily
    attributable to the associated reduction in our accrued tax and
    related accrued interest liabilities. For information regarding
    the status of current audit activity, refer to Note 10.

Repatriation of earnings in foreign
    subsidiaries

— On October 22, 2004, the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) became
    law. A provision of the Act allowed U.S. companies to
    repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced
    tax rate during 2005. We repatriated net accumulated earnings
    and capital from certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in
    accordance with this provision, which were previously accounted
    for as permanently reinvested in accordance with APB Opinion
    No. 23,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes — Special Areas.

During
    2005, our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors
    approved a domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated
    $496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and
    capital through cash on hand as well as debt borrowings. Refer
    to Note 7 for discussion on the related debt issuance.
    During 2005, we accrued $34 million in tax expense for
    these repatriations. The repatriation of earnings from our
    Canadian subsidiaries increased our 2005 effective tax rate by
    approximately 3.1%, which has been reflected as a component of
    the “Tax rate differential on foreign income” line
    item of the effective tax rate reconciliation provided above.
    During 2006, we repatriated an additional $12 million of
    our accumulated foreign earnings resulting in an increase in tax
    expense of $3 million.

At December 31, 2006, remaining unremitted earnings in
    foreign operations was approximately $300 million, which is
    considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision for
    U.S. income taxes has been accrued for these unremitted
    earnings.

Effective state tax rate change

— Our estimated
    effective state tax rate declined during 2006 and 2005,
    resulting in a net benefit of $9 million and
    $16 million, respectively, related to the revaluation of
    net accumulated deferred tax liabilities.

Canada statutory tax rate change

— During 2006,
    both the Canadian federal government and several provinces
    enacted tax rate reductions. SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, requires that deferred tax
    balances be revalued to reflect such tax rate changes. The
    revaluation resulted in a $20 million tax benefit for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. During 2005, a provincial tax
    rate change in Quebec resulted in additional income tax expense
    of $4 million related to the revaluation of net accumulated
    deferred tax balances.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2006 we had $27 million of federal net
    operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards,
    $3.5 billion of state NOL carryforwards, and
    $19 million of Canadian NOL carryforwards. The federal and
    state NOL carryforwards have expiration dates through the year
    2026. The Canadian NOL carryforwards have the following expiry:
    $12 million in 2009, $1 million in 2010,
    $1 million in 2011 and $5 million in 2012. We have
    $21 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards
    that may be used indefinitely and state tax credit carryforwards
    of $11 million.

We have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in
    realizing the benefit of tax loss and credit carryforwards and
    other deferred tax assets. While we expect to realize the
    deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances, changes in
    estimates of future taxable income or in tax laws may alter this
    expectation. The valuation allowance decreased $47 million
    in 2006. We realized an $11 million state tax benefit due
    to a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the
    expected utilization of state NOL and credit carryforwards. The
    remaining reduction in our valuation allowance was offset by
    changes in our gross deferred tax assets due to changes in state
    NOL and credit carryforwards.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Defined contribution plans

— Our Waste
    Management Retirement Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”)
    covers employees (except those working subject to collective
    bargaining agreements, which do not provide for coverage under
    such plans) following a

90-day

waiting period after hire. Through December 31, 2004
    eligible employees were allowed to contribute up to 15% of their
    annual compensation. Effective January 1, 2005, eligible
    employees may contribute as much as 25% of their annual
    compensation under the Savings Plan. All employee contributions
    are subject to annual contribution limitations established by
    the IRS. Under the Savings Plan, we match, in cash, 100% of
    employee contributions on the first 3% of their eligible
    compensation and match 50% of employee contributions on the next
    3% of their eligible compensation, resulting in a maximum match
    of 4.5%. Both employee and company contributions vest
    immediately. Charges to “Operating” and “Selling,
    general and administrative” expenses for our defined
    contribution plans were $51 million in 2006,
    $48 million in 2005 and $46 million in 2004.

Defined benefit plans

— Certain of the
    Company’s subsidiaries sponsor pension plans that cover
    employees not covered by the Savings Plan. These employees are
    members of collective bargaining units. In addition,
    Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary,
    sponsors a pension plan for its former executives and former
    Board members. The combined benefit obligation of these pension
    plans is $61 million as of December 31, 2006. These
    plans have approximately $45 million of plan assets as of
    December 31, 2006.

In addition, Waste Management Holdings, Inc.
    (“WM Holdings”) and certain of its subsidiaries
    provided post-retirement health care and other benefits to
    eligible employees. In conjunction with our acquisition of
    WM Holdings in July 1998, we limited participation in these
    plans to participating retired employees as of December 31,
    1998. The unfunded benefit obligation for these plans was
    $60 million at December 31, 2006.

Our accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension
    and other post-retirement plans are $76 million as of
    December 31, 2006 and are included as a component of
    “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which
    requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
    status of their defined benefit pension and other
    post-retirement plans as an asset or liability and to recognize
    changes in that funded status through comprehensive income in
    the year in which the changes occur. As required, the Company
    adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158, we recorded a
    liability and a corresponding deferred loss adjustment to
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income” of
    $2 million related to the previously unaccrued liability
    balance associated with our defined benefit pension and other
    post-retirement plans. The December 31, 2006 net
    increase of $1 million in “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” attributable to the underfunded
    status of our post-

retirement plans is associated with the net impact of
    adjustments to increase deferred tax assets by $3 million,
    partially offset by the additional $2 million in
    liabilities recorded.

In addition, certain of our subsidiaries participate in various
    multi-employer employee benefit and pension plans covering union
    employees not covered under other pension plans. These
    multi-employer plans are generally defined contribution plans.
    Specific benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not
    negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.
    Additionally, we have one instance of a site-specific plan for
    employees not covered under other plans. The projected benefit
    obligation, plan assets and unfunded liability of the
    multi-employer pension plans and the site specific plan are not
    material. Contributions of $37 million in 2006,
    $38 million in 2005 and $29 million in 2004 were
    charged to operations for those subsidiaries’ defined
    benefit and contribution plans.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Financial instruments

— We have obtained
    letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies, and
    have established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to
    support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure requirements, environmental
    remediation, and other obligations.

Historically, our revolving credit facilities have been used to
    obtain letters of credit to support our bonding and financial
    assurance needs. We also have letter of credit and term loan
    agreements and a letter of credit facility that were established
    to provide us with additional sources of capacity from which we
    may obtain letters of credit. These facilities and agreements
    are discussed further in Note 7. We obtain surety bonds and
    insurance policies from two entities in which we have a
    non-controlling financial interest. We also obtain insurance
    from a wholly-owned insurance company, the sole business of
    which is to issue policies for the parent holding company and
    its other subsidiaries, to secure such performance obligations.
    In those instances where our use of captive insurance is not
    allowed, we generally have available alternative bonding
    mechanisms.

Because virtually no claims have been made against the financial
    instruments we use to support our obligations and considering
    our current financial position, management does not expect that
    any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty
    in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for
    our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks
    of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity,
    we continue to evaluate various options to access cost-effective
    sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance coverage for
    protection of our assets and operations from certain risks
    including automobile liability, general liability, real and
    personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’
    and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and
    other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our
    exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to
    the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy.
    Our exposure, however, could increase if our insurers were
    unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation
    insurance programs. For our self-insured retentions, the
    exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including
    incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial
    valuation and internal estimates. The estimated accruals for
    these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences or
    loss development significantly differ from utilized assumptions.
    As of December 31, 2006, our general liability insurance
    program carries self-insurance exposures of up to
    $2.5 million per incident and our workers’
    compensation and auto liability insurance programs each carry
    self-insurance exposures of up to $1 million per incident.
    Effective January 1, 2007, we increased the per incident
    deductible for our workers’ compensation insurance program
    to $1.5 million. Self-insurance claims reserves acquired as
    part of our acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998 were
    discounted at

(a)

Amounts reported as estimated insurance recoveries are related
    to both paid and unpaid claims liabilities.

For the 14 months ended January 1, 2000, we insured
    certain risks, including auto, general liability and
    workers’ compensation, with Reliance National Insurance
    Company, whose parent filed for bankruptcy in June 2001. In
    October 2001, the parent and certain of its subsidiaries,
    including Reliance National Insurance Company, were placed in
    liquidation. We believe that because of various state insurance
    guarantee funds and probable recoveries from the liquidation,
    currently estimated to be $19 million, it is unlikely that
    events relating to Reliance will have a material adverse impact
    on our financial statements.

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property,
    environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating leases

— Rental expense for leased
    properties was $122 million, $129 million and
    $127 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    These amounts primarily include rents under operating leases.
    Minimum contractual payments due during each of the next five
    years for our operating lease obligations are noted below
    (in millions):






$ 89

$

Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during
    future periods is significantly less than current year rent
    expense because our significant lease agreements at landfills
    have variable terms based either on a percentage of revenue or a
    rate per ton of waste received.

Other commitments

— We have the following
    unconditional obligations:

•

Share Repurchases

— In December 2006, we
    entered into a plan under SEC

Rule 10b5-1

to effect market purchases of our common stock during the first
    quarter of 2007. See Note 14 for additional information
    related to this agreement.

•

Fuel Supply

— We have purchase agreements
    expiring at various dates through 2010 that require us to
    purchase minimum amounts of waste and conventional fuels at our
    independent power production plants. These fuel supplies are
    used to produce electricity for sale to electric utilities,
    which is generally subject to



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the terms and conditions of long-term contracts. Our purchase
    agreements have been established based on the plants’
    anticipated fuel supply needs to meet the demands of our
    customers under these long-term electricity sale contracts.
    Under our fuel supply

take-or-pay

contracts, we are generally obligated to pay for a minimum
    amount of waste or conventional fuel at a stated rate even if
    such quantities are not required in our operations.

•

Disposal

— We have several agreements expiring
    at various dates through 2024 that require us to dispose of a
    minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under
    these

put-or-pay

agreements, we are required to pay for the agreed upon minimum
    volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the
    facilities.

•

Waste Paper

— We are party to a waste paper
    purchase agreement that requires us to purchase a minimum number
    of tons of waste paper from the counterparty. The cost per ton
    of waste paper purchased is based on market prices plus the cost
    of delivery of the product to our customers. We currently expect
    to fulfill our purchase obligation in 2012.

•

Royalties

— Certain of our landfill operating
    agreements require us to make minimum royalty payments to the
    prior land owners, lessors or host community where the landfill
    is located. Our obligations under these agreements expire at
    various dates through 2031. Although the agreements provide for
    minimum payments, the actual payments we expect to make under
    the agreements, which are based on per ton rates for waste
    received at the landfill, are significantly higher.

Our unconditional obligations are established in the ordinary
    course of our business and are structured in a manner that
    provides us with access to important resources at competitive,
    market-driven rates. Our actual future obligations under these
    outstanding agreements are generally quantity driven, and, as a
    result, our associated financial obligations are not fixed as of
    December 31, 2006. We currently expect the products and
    services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the
    needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect
    these established arrangements to materially impact our future
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following
    guarantee agreements associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2006, WM Holdings, one of
    WMI’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior
    indebtedness, which matures through 2032. WMI has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of the senior indebtedness of
    WM Holdings, which matures through 2026. Performance under
    these guarantee agreements would be required if either party
    defaulted on their respective obligations. No additional
    liability has been recorded for these guarantees because the
    underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. See Note 22 for further information.

•

WMI and WM Holdings have guaranteed the tax-exempt bonds
    and other debt obligations of their subsidiaries. If a
    subsidiary fails to meet its obligations associated with its
    debt agreements as they come due, WMI or WM Holdings will
    be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liability has been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 for information
    related to the balances and maturities of our tax-exempt bonds.

•

We have guaranteed certain financial obligations of
    unconsolidated entities. The related obligations, which mature
    through 2020, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of December 31, 2006, our maximum future
    payments associated with these guarantees are approximately
    $20 million. We do not believe that it is likely that we
    will be required to perform under these guarantees.

•

WM Holdings has guaranteed all reimbursement obligations of
    WMI under its $350 million letter of credit facility and
    $295 million letter of credit and term loan agreements.
    Under those facilities, WMI must reimburse the entities funding
    the facilities for any draw on a letter of credit supported by
    the facilities. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    $641 million in outstanding letters of credit under these
    facilities.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

In connection with the $350 million letter of credit
    facility, WMI and WM Holdings guaranteed the interest rate
    swaps entered into by the entity funding the letter of credit
    facility. The probability of loss for the guarantees was
    determined to be remote and the fair value of the guarantees is
    immaterial to our financial position and results of operations.

•

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market value of
    certain homeowners’ properties that are adjacent to certain
    of our landfills. These guarantee agreements extend over the
    life of the respective landfill. Under these agreements, we
    would be responsible for the difference between the sale value
    and the guaranteed market value of the homeowners’
    properties, if any. Generally, it is not possible to determine
    the contingent obligation associated with these guarantees, but
    we do not believe that these contingent obligations will have a
    material effect on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

•

We have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested
    assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of
    our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items
    that are currently recorded as obligations, we do not believe
    that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations
    associated with these indemnities. Additionally, under certain
    of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional
    consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial
    targets are achieved post-closing. The costs associated with any
    additional consideration requirements are accounted for as
    incurred.

•

WMI and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial
    and general operating obligations of certain of their
    subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual
    obligations as they come due, the guarantor has an unconditional
    obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has
    been recorded for service, financial or general operating
    guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are
    properly accounted for as costs of operations as services are
    provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No
    additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees
    because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly
    accounted for as operating or capital leases, as appropriate.

We currently believe that it is not reasonably likely that we
    will be required to perform under these guarantee agreements or
    that any performance requirement would have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

Environmental matters

— Our business is
    intrinsically connected with the protection of the environment.
    As such, a significant portion of our operating costs and
    capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of
    environmental protection. Such costs may increase in the future
    as a result of legislation or regulation. However, we believe
    that we tend to benefit when environmental regulation increases,
    because such regulations increase the demand for our services,
    and we have the resources and experience to manage environmental
    risk.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation of a
    particular site is inherently difficult and determining the
    method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number
    of assumptions be made. Our ultimate responsibility may differ
    materially from current estimates. It is possible that
    technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the
    results of environmental studies, the inability to identify
    other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the
    settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require
    us to record additional liabilities that could be material.
    Additionally, our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities
    could result in revisions that could cause upward or downward
    adjustments to income from operations. These adjustments could
    also be material in any given period.

As of December 31, 2006, we had been notified that we are a
    PRP in connection with 75 locations listed on the EPA’s
    National Priorities List (“NPL”). Of the 75 sites at
    which claims have been made against us, 16 are sites we own.
    Each of the NPL sites we own were initially developed by others
    as land disposal facilities. At each of these facilities, we are
    working in conjunction with the government to characterize or
    remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed
    with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing
    the costs of remediation or are pursuing resolution of an
    allocation formula. We generally expect to receive any amounts
    due from these parties at, or near, the time that we make the
    remedial expenditures. The 59 NPL sites at which claims have
    been made



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

against us and that we do not own are at different procedural
    stages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which is
    known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of these proceedings involve allegations that
    certain of our subsidiaries (or their predecessors) transported
    hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our
    acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for
    liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to
    or disposing at the sites. Proceedings arising under Superfund
    typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste
    transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or
    recover costs associated with site investigation and
    remediation, which costs could be substantial and could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. At some of the sites at which we’ve been
    identified as a PRP, our liability is well defined as a
    consequence of a governmental decision and an agreement among
    liable parties as to the share each will pay for implementing
    that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has been selected
    or the liable parties have been unable to agree on an
    appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain. Any of
    these matters potentially could have a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated financial statements.

For more information regarding commitments and contingencies
    with respect to environmental matters, see Note 3.

Litigation

— In December 1999, an individual
    brought an action against WMI, five former officers of
    WM Holdings, and WM Holdings’ former independent
    auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, in Illinois state court on behalf
    of a proposed class of individuals who purchased
    WM Holdings common stock before November 3, 1994, and
    who held that stock through February 24, 1998. The action
    is for alleged acts of common law fraud, negligence and breach
    of fiduciary duty. This case has remained in the pleadings stage
    for the last several years due to numerous motions and rulings
    by the court related to the viability of these claims. The
    defendants had removed the case to federal court in Illinois,
    but in 2006 agreed to the matter being held in state court as
    originally filed. The Company believes that recent
    U.S. Supreme Court decisions in other cases require the
    Illinois trial court to rule this matter cannot proceed as a
    class action. Only limited discovery has occurred and the
    defendants continue to defend themselves vigorously. The extent
    of possible damages, if any, in this action cannot yet be
    determined.

In April 2002, a former participant in WM Holdings’
    ERISA plans and another individual filed a lawsuit in
    Washington, D.C. against WMI, WM Holdings and others,
    attempting to increase the recovery of a class of ERISA plan
    participants based on allegations related to both the events
    alleged in, and the settlements relating to, the securities
    class action against WM Holdings that was settled in 1998
    and the securities class action against us that was settled in
    November 2001. Subsequently, the issues related to the latter
    class action have been dropped as to WMI, its officers and
    directors. The case is ongoing with respect to WM Holdings
    and others, and WM Holdings intends to defend itself
    vigorously.

In 2000 and 2001, respectively, two separate lawsuits were filed
    in Texas state court against WMI and certain former officers of
    WMI alleging that the plaintiffs were substantial holders of the
    Company’s common stock who intended to sell their stock in
    1999, or to otherwise protect themselves against loss, but that
    statements the defendants made regarding the Company’s
    prospects were false and misleading and induced the plaintiffs
    to retain their stock or not to take other protective measures.
    The plaintiffs asserted that the value of their retained stock
    declined dramatically and that they incurred significant losses.
    The first of these cases was dismissed by summary judgment by a
    Texas state court in March 2002. The plaintiffs appealed the
    dismissal to the highest state court in Texas, which in 2006
    declined to hear the case. The plaintiff in the second case,
    which was stayed pending resolution of the first case, filed a
    motion for non-suit, thereby ending the case against us.

In 2000, we sold our interest in a joint venture in Mexico. In
    2002, the purchaser of the interest brought a claim against the
    Company generally involving the value of the joint venture, and
    seeking a variety of remedies ranging from monetary damages to
    unwinding the sale of the assets. The matter was fully tried in
    an international arbitration and in the fourth quarter of 2006
    we received a final ruling obligating us to pay approximately
    $29 million, which includes monetary damages plus
    substantial interest dating back to 2000 plus certain fees and
    expenses.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

From time to time, we pay fines or penalties in environmental
    proceedings relating primarily to waste treatment, storage or
    disposal facilities. As of December 31, 2006, there were
    four proceedings involving our subsidiaries where we reasonably
    believe that the sanctions could exceed $100,000. The matters
    involve allegations that subsidiaries (i) failed to comply
    with air permit, air emission limit and leachate storage
    requirements at an operating landfill; (ii) violated a
    number of state solid waste regulations and permit conditions
    and federal air regulations at an operating landfill;
    (iii) failed to meet reporting requirements under federal
    air regulations at an operating landfill; and (iv) failed
    to perform state emissions tests for diesel-powered vehicles. We
    do not believe that the fines or other penalties in any of these
    matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

From time to time, we also are named as defendants in personal
    injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class
    actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported
    waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have
    contaminated the environment or, in certain cases, on the basis
    of having conducted environmental remediation activities at
    sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of
    monitoring and health care examinations of allegedly affected
    sites and persons for a substantial period of time even where no
    actual damage is proven. While we believe we have meritorious
    defenses to these lawsuits, the ultimate resolution is often
    substantially uncertain due to the difficulty of determining the
    cause, extent and impact of alleged contamination (which may
    have occurred over a long period of time), the potential for
    successive groups of complainants to emerge, the diversity of
    the individual plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential
    contribution or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or
    other third parties, among other factors. Accordingly, it is
    possible such matters could have a material adverse impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

It is not always possible to predict the impact that lawsuits,
    proceedings, investigations and inquiries may have on us, nor is
    it possible to predict whether additional suits or claims may
    arise out of the matters described above in the future. We
    intend to defend ourselves vigorously in all the above matters.
    However, it is possible that the outcome of any of the matters
    described, or others, may ultimately have a material adverse
    impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows in one or more future periods.

Under Delaware law, corporations are allowed to indemnify their
    officers, directors and employees against claims arising from
    their actions in such capacities if the individuals acted in
    good faith and in a manner they believed to be in, or not
    opposed to, the best interests of the corporation. Further,
    corporations are allowed to advance expenses to the individuals
    in such matters, contingent upon the receipt of an undertaking
    by the individuals to repay all expenses if it is ultimately
    determined that they did not act in good faith and in a manner
    they believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of
    the corporation. WMI’s charter and bylaws currently require
    indemnification of and advancement of expenses to its officers
    and directors if these standards have been met and previously
    required indemnification of and advancement of expenses to all
    employees if the standards were met. Additionally, WMI has
    entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of
    the members of its Board of Directors as well as its Chief
    Executive Officer, its President and its Chief Financial
    Officer. The charter and bylaw documents of certain of
    WMI’s subsidiaries, including WM Holdings, also include
    similar indemnification provisions, and some subsidiaries,
    including WM Holdings, entered into separate
    indemnification agreements with their officers and directors
    prior to our acquisition of them that provide for even greater
    rights and protections for the individuals than WMI’s
    charter and bylaws.

The Company’s obligations to indemnify and advance expenses
    are determined based on the governing documents in effect and
    the status of the individual at the time the actions giving rise
    to the claim occurred. As a result, we may have obligations to
    individuals after they leave the Company and also may have
    obligations to individuals that are or were employees of the
    Company, but who were neither an officer or a director, even
    though the current documents only require indemnification and
    advancement to officers and directors. The Company may incur
    substantial expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its
    advancement of costs and indemnification obligations in
    connection with current actions involving former officers of the
    Company or its subsidiaries or other

actions or proceedings that may be brought against its former or
    current officers, directors and employees in the future.

We are involved in routine civil litigation and governmental
    proceedings, including litigation involving former employees and
    competitors arising in the ordinary course of our business. We
    do not believe that any such matters will ultimately have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Tax matters

— We are currently under audit by
    the IRS and from time to time are audited by other taxing
    authorities. We fully cooperate with all audits, but defend our
    positions vigorously. Our audits are in various stages of
    completion. We have concluded several audits in the last two
    years. During the second quarter of 2006, we concluded the IRS
    audit for the years 2002 and 2003. The current period financial
    statement impact of concluding various audits is discussed in
    Note 8. In addition, we are in the examination phase of an
    IRS audit for the years 2004 and 2005. We expect this audit to
    be completed within the next 12 months. To provide for
    certain potential tax exposures, we maintain an allowance for
    tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes is
    adequate. Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities
    could have a material effect on our quarterly or annual cash
    flows as audits are completed, although we do not believe that
    current tax audit matters will have a material adverse impact on
    our results of operations.

As discussed in Note 7, we have approximately
    $2.8 billion of tax-exempt financings as of
    December 31, 2006. Tax-exempt financings are structured
    pursuant to certain terms and conditions of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which exempts
    from taxation the interest income earned by the bondholders in
    the transactions. The requirements of the Code can be complex,
    and failure to comply with these requirements could cause
    certain past interest payments made on the bonds to be taxable
    and could cause either outstanding principal amounts on the
    bonds to be accelerated or future interest payments on the bonds
    to be taxable. Some of the Company’s tax-exempt financings
    have been, or currently are, the subject of examinations by the
    IRS to determine whether the financings meet the requirements of
    the Code and applicable regulations. It is possible that an
    adverse determination by the IRS could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s cash flows and results of
    operations.

Unclaimed property audits

— We are currently
    undergoing unclaimed property audits, which are being conducted
    by various state authorities. The property subject to review in
    this audit process generally includes unclaimed wages, vendor
    payments and customer refunds. State escheat laws generally
    require entities to report and remit abandoned and unclaimed
    property. Failure to timely report and remit the property can
    result in assessments that include substantial interest and
    penalties, in addition to the payment of the escheat liability
    itself. During 2006, we submitted unclaimed property filings
    with all states. As a result of our findings, we determined that
    we had estimated unrecorded obligations associated with
    unclaimed property of approximately $20 million for
    escheatable items for various periods between 1980 and 2004. Our
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 include the charge required to
    record these obligations. During 2006, we also recognized
    $1 million of estimated interest obligations associated
    with our findings, which has been included in “Interest
    expense” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We
    have determined that the impact of these adjustments is not
    material to current or prior periods’ results of
    operations. Although we cannot currently estimate the potential
    financial impacts that any remaining audit findings may have, we
    do not expect any resulting obligations to have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash
    flows.

Restructuring

2005 Restructuring and Workforce Reduction

—
    During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified
    our management structure by reducing our Group and corporate
    office staffing levels. This reorganization increases the
    accountability and responsibility of our Market Areas and allows
    us to streamline business decisions and to reduce costs at the
    Group and Corporate offices. Additionally, as part of our
    restructuring, the responsibility for the management of our
    Canadian operations has been assumed by our Eastern, Midwest and
    Western Groups, thus eliminating the Canadian Group. See
    discussion at Note 20.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The reorganization eliminated about 600 employee positions
    throughout the Company. In 2005, we recorded $28 million
    for costs associated with the implementation of the new
    structure. These charges included $25 million for employee
    severance and benefit costs, $1 million related to
    abandoned operating lease agreements and $2 million related
    to consulting fees incurred to align our sales strategy to our
    changes in both resources and leadership that resulted from the
    reorganization.

Through December 31, 2006, we paid $24 million of the
    employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of
    this restructuring. Approximately $6 million and
    $18 million of these payments were made during 2006 and
    2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, approximately
    $1 million of the related accrual remained for employee
    severance and benefit costs. The length of time we are obligated
    to make severance payments varies, with the longest obligation
    continuing through the third quarter of 2007.

Asset impairments

— During the second and third
    quarters of 2006, we recorded impairment charges of
    $13 million and $5 million, respectively, for
    operations we intend to sell as part of our divestiture program.
    The charges were required to reduce the carrying values of the
    operations to their estimated fair values less the cost to sell
    in accordance with the guidance provided by
    SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, for assets to be disposed of
    by sale.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2006, we recorded
    impairment charges of $10 million and $14 million,
    respectively, for assets and businesses associated with our
    continuing operations. The charges recognized during the third
    quarter of 2006 were related to operations in our Recycling and
    Southern Groups. The charges recognized during the fourth
    quarter of 2006 were primarily attributable to the impairment of
    a landfill in our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our
    expectations for future expansions.

(Income) expense from divestitures

— We
    recognized $44 million of net gains on divestitures during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, which were direct results
    of the execution of our plan to review under-performing or
    non-strategic operations and to either improve their performance
    or dispose of the operations. The majority of these net gains
    was recognized during the second quarter of 2006 and relates to
    operations located in our Western Group. Total proceeds from
    divestitures completed during the year ended December 31,
    2006 were $184 million, all of which were received in cash.

Other

— During the fourth quarter of 2006, we
    recognized a charge of approximately $26 million for the
    impact of an arbitration ruling against us related to the
    termination of a joint venture relationship in 2000. The party
    that purchased our interest in the joint venture had sued us,
    seeking a variety of remedies ranging from monetary damages to
    unwinding the sale of assets. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the
    arbitration tribunal ruled in the other party’s favor,
    awarding them approximately $29 million, which includes
    monetary damages, interest, and certain fees and expenses. Prior
    to the ruling, the Company had recorded a reserve of
    $3 million. For additional information regarding this
    matter refer to Note 10.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2005

Asset impairments

— During the second quarter
    of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a $35 million charge
    for the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill located in West
    Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania. We determined that an
    impairment was necessary after the Pennsylvania Environmental
    Hearing Board upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of
    Environmental Protection of a permit application for a vertical
    expansion at the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the
    Company reviewed the options available at the Pottstown Landfill
    and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options.
    After such evaluation and considering the length of time
    required for the appeal process and the permit application
    review, we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial.
    This decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the
    permitting delays, which would hinder our ability to fully
    utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill’s
    required closure in 2010. We continued to operate the Pottstown
    Landfill using existing permitted airspace through the
    landfill’s permit expiration date of October 2005.

Through June 30, 2005, our “Property and
    equipment” had included approximately $80 million of
    accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system.
    Approximately $59 million of these costs were specifically
    associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts
    required to develop and configure that software for our use,
    while the remaining costs were associated with the general
    efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our
    existing applications and hardware. The development efforts
    associated with our revenue management system were suspended in
    2003. Since that time, there have been changes in the viable
    software alternatives available to address our current needs.
    During the third quarter of 2005, we concluded our assessment of
    potential revenue management system options. As a result, we
    entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the
    license, implementation and maintenance of certain of its
    applications software, including waste and recycling
    functionality. We believe that these newly licensed
    applications, when fully implemented, will provide substantially
    better capabilities and functionality than the software we were
    developing. Our plan to implement this newly licensed software
    resulted in a $59 million charge in the third quarter of
    2005 for the software that had been under development and
    capitalized costs associated with the development efforts
    specific to that software.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an
    $18 million charge for asset impairments. This charge was
    primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our
    Eastern Group, as a result of a change in our expectations for
    future expansions, and the impairment of capitalized software
    costs related to two applications we decided not to develop
    further.

(Income) expense from divestitures

— During the
    first quarter of 2005, we recognized a $39 million gain as
    a result of the divestiture of a landfill in Ontario, Canada,
    which was required as a result of a Divestiture Order from the
    Canadian Competition Bureau. During the remainder of 2005, we
    recognized a total of $40 million in gains as a

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

result of the divestiture of operations. With the exception of
    our divestiture of the Ontario, Canada landfill, our
    divestitures during 2005 were direct results of the execution of
    our plan to review under-performing or non-strategic operations
    and to either improve their performance or dispose of the
    operations.

Total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended
    December 31, 2005 were $172 million, of which
    $140 million was received in cash, $23 million was in
    the form of a note receivable and $9 million was in the
    form of non-monetary assets.

Other

— In the first quarter of 2005, we
    recognized a charge of approximately $16 million for the
    impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of
    stockholders that opted not to participate in the settlement of
    the securities class action lawsuit against us related to 1998
    and 1999 activity. During the third quarter of 2005, we settled
    our ongoing defense costs and possible indemnity obligations for
    four former officers of WM Holdings related to legacy litigation
    brought against them by the SEC. As a result, we recorded a
    $26.8 million charge for the funding of the court-ordered
    distribution of $27.5 million to our shareholders in
    settlement of the legacy litigation against the former officers.
    These charges were partially offset by the recognition of a
    $12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2005, which was primarily for adjustments to
    our receivables and estimated obligations for non-solid waste
    operations divested in 1999 and 2000.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2004

For 2004, the significant items included within “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” were (i) $17 million in impairment losses
    primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and
    software development costs; (ii) $12 million in
    (income) expense from divestitures that primarily related to
    certain

Share
    repurchases

In 2004, our Board of Directors approved a capital allocation
    plan that allows for up to $1.2 billion in annual share
    repurchases, net of dividends, for 2005 through 2007. In June
    2006, our Board of Directors approved up to $350 million of
    additional share repurchases for 2006, increasing the maximum
    amount of capital to be allocated to our share repurchases and
    dividend payments for 2006 to $1.55 billion. All share
    repurchases in 2005 and 2006 have been made pursuant to these
    Board authorized capital allocation plans. Share repurchases
    during 2004 were made in accordance with a similar capital
    allocation plan, which authorized up to $1.0 billion in
    annual share repurchases, net of dividends.

The following is a summary of activity under our stock

Our 2006 share repurchase activity includes
    $291 million paid to repurchase our common stock through an
    accelerated share repurchase transaction. The number of shares
    we repurchased under the accelerated repurchase transaction was
    determined by dividing $275 million by the fair market
    value of our common stock on the repurchase date. At the end of
    the valuation period, which was in February 2006, we were
    required to make a settlement payment for the difference between
    the $275 million paid at the inception of the valuation
    period and the weighted average daily market price of our common
    stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we
    repurchased, or $16 million. We elected to make the
    required settlement payment in cash.

In December 2006, we entered into a plan under SEC
    Rule 10b5-1 to effect market purchases of our common stock.
    These common stock repurchases were made in accordance with our
    Board approved capital allocation program, which authorizes up
    to $1.2 billion to be returned to shareholders in the form
    of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased
    $72 million of our common stock pursuant to the plan, which
    was completed on February 9, 2007.

In August 2003, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which employees
    that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase
    shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for
    two offering periods for purchases: January through June and
    July through December. At the end of each offering period,
    employees are able to purchase shares of common stock at a price
    equal to 85% of the lesser of the market value of the stock on
    the first or last day of such offering period. The purchases are
    made through payroll deductions, and the number of shares that
    may be purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The total number
    of shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in each
    of 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately 644,000, 675,000, and
    654,000, respectively. Including the impact of the January 2007
    issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2006
    offering period, approximately 2.0 million shares remain
    available for issuance under the plan.

Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is “compensatory”
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly,
    beginning with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on
    January 1, 2006 we recognize compensation expense
    associated with our employees’ participation in the Stock
    Purchase Plan. For 2006 our Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    increased annual compensation expense by approximately
    $5 million, or $3 million net of tax.

Employee
    Stock Incentive Plans

Pursuant to our stock incentive plan, we have the ability to
    issue stock options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights,
    all on terms and conditions determined by the Management
    Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

As of January 1, 2004, we had two plans under which we
    granted stock options and restricted stock awards: the 2000
    Stock Incentive Plan and the 2000 Broad-Based Plan. These two
    plans allowed for grants of stock options, appreciation rights
    and stock awards to key employees, except grants under the 2000
    Broad-Based Plan could not be made to any executive officer. All
    of the options granted under these plans had exercise prices
    equal to the fair market value as of the date of the grant,
    expired no later than ten years from the date of grant and
    vested ratably over a four or five-year period.

Since May 2004, all stock-based compensation awards described
    herein have been made under the Company’s 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan, which authorizes the issuance of a maximum of
    34 million shares of our common stock. Upon adoption by the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board
    of Directors and the approval by the stockholders of the 2004
    Stock Incentive Plan at the 2004 Annual Meeting of stockholders,
    all of the Company’s other stock-based incentive plans were
    terminated, with the exception of the 2000 Broad-Based Employee
    Plan. The Broad-Based Employee Plan was not required to be
    approved by stockholders, as no executive officers of the
    Company may receive any grants under the plan. However, only
    approximately 100,000 shares remain available for issuance
    under that plan. We currently utilize treasury shares to meet
    the needs of our equity-based compensation programs under the
    2004 Stock Incentive Plan and to settle outstanding awards
    granted pursuant to previous incentive plans. During 2005 and
    2006, the primary forms of equity-based compensation granted to
    our employees under our long-term incentive programs were
    restricted stock units and performance share units.

Additionally, as a result of both the changes in accounting
    required by SFAS No. 123(R) for share-based payments
    and a desire to design our long-term incentive plans in a manner
    that creates a stronger link to operating and market
    performance, the Management Development and Compensation
    Committee approved a substantial change in the form of awards
    that we grant. As discussed above, through December 31,
    2004, stock option awards were the primary form of equity-based
    compensation. Beginning in 2005, annual stock option grants were
    replaced



WASTE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

with either (i) grants of restricted stock units and
    performance share units or (ii) an enhanced cash
    compensation award. Stock option grants in connection with new
    hires and promotions were replaced with grants of restricted
    stock units.

Restricted stock units

— During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we granted approximately 755,000
    restricted stock units. These restricted stock units provide the
    award recipients with dividend equivalents during the vesting
    period, but the units may not be voted or sold until time-based
    vesting restrictions have lapsed. The restricted stock units
    vest ratably over a four-year period, and unvested units are
    subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause
    termination. These restricted stock units are subject to
    pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s retirement or
    involuntary termination other than for cause and become
    immediately vested in the event of an employee’s death or
    disability.

Compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is
    measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock
    and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required
    employment period, which is generally the vesting period.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    current period and historical forfeitures.

(a)

The total fair market value of the shares issued upon the
    vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was $7 million. This amount was not
    material in 2005.

Performance share units

— During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we granted approximately 724,000
    performance share units. The performance share units are payable
    in shares of common stock based on the achievement of certain
    financial measures, after the end of a three-year performance
    period. Performance share units do not provide award recipients
    with either dividend equivalents or voting rights during the
    required performance period. These performance share units are
    payable to an employee (or his beneficiary) upon death or
    disability as if that employee had remained employed until the
    end of the performance period, subject to pro-rata vesting upon
    an employee’s retirement or involuntary termination other
    than for cause and subject to forfeiture in the event of
    voluntary or for-cause termination.

Compensation expense associated with performance share units
    that continue to vest based on future performance is measured
    based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock, net of
    the present value of expected dividend payments on our common
    stock during the vesting period. Compensation expense is
    recognized ratably over the performance period based on our
    estimated achievement of the established performance criteria.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    both the probability that the performance criteria will be
    achieved and current period and historical forfeitures.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized
    $21 million of compensation expense associated with
    restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards as a
    component of “Selling, general and administrative”
    expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our
    “Provision for (benefit from) income taxes” for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 includes a related deferred
    income tax benefit of $8 million. We have not capitalized
    any equity-based compensation costs during the year ended
    December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we
    estimate that a total of approximately $48 million of
    currently unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized
    in future periods for unvested restricted stock unit and
    performance share unit awards issued and outstanding. This
    expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
    period of approximately 2.5 years.

Stock options

— Prior to 2005, stock options
    were the primary form of equity-based compensation we granted to
    our employees. On December 16, 2005, the Management
    Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors
    approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock
    options awarded under our stock incentive plans effective
    December 28, 2005. The decision to accelerate the vesting
    of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the
    future non-cash compensation expense that we would have
    otherwise recorded as a result of our January 1, 2006
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We estimate that the
    acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of
    pre-tax compensation charges that would have been recognized
    over 2006, 2007 and 2008 as the stock options vested. We
    recognized a $2 million pre-tax charge to compensation
    expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the
    acceleration, but will not be required to recognize future
    compensation expense for the accelerated options under
    SFAS No. 123(R) unless further modifications are made
    to the options, which is not anticipated.

Non-Employee
    Director Plans

Pursuant to our 2003 Directors’ Deferred Compensation
    Plan, a portion of the cash compensation that our directors
    would otherwise receive is deferred until after their
    termination from board service and each director may elect to
    defer the remaining cash compensation to a date that he chooses,
    which must be after termination of board service. At that time,
    all deferred compensation is paid in shares of our common stock.
    The number of shares the directors receive is calculated on the
    date the cash compensation would have been payable, based on the
    fair market value of our common stock on that day.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

We have determined the estimated fair value amounts of our
    financial instruments using available market information and
    commonly accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable
    judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
    estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not
    necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the
    instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use
    of different assumptions

and/or

estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the
    estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on
    information available as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.
    These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and
    current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from
    the amounts presented.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable,
    financial instruments included in other receivables and certain
    financial instruments included in other assets or other
    liabilities are reflected in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements at historical cost, which is materially
    representative of their fair value principally because of the
    short-term maturities of these instruments.

Long-term investments

— Included as a component
    of “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
    at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 is
    $72 million and $70 million, respectively, for the
    cost basis of restricted investments in equity-based mutual
    funds. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, our
    “Other assets” also included $22 million and
    $51 million, respectively, for the cost basis of restricted
    investments in U.S. government agency debt securities.
    Unrealized holding gains and losses on these instruments are
    recorded as either an increase or decrease to the asset balance
    and deferred as a component of “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” in the equity section of our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized holding gains on
    these instruments, net of taxes, were $10 million as of
    December 31, 2006 and $5 million as of
    December 31, 2005. Refer to Note 13.

Debt and interest rate derivatives

— At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of our debt
    was approximately $8.3 billion and $8.7 billion,
    respectively. The carrying value includes adjustments for both
    the unamortized fair value adjustments related to terminated
    hedge arrangements and fair value adjustments of debt
    instruments that are currently hedged. See Note 7. For
    active hedge arrangements, the fair value of the derivative is
    included in other current assets, other long-term assets,
    accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as
    appropriate. The estimated fair value of our debt was
    approximately $8.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately $9.2 billion at December 31, 2005. The
    estimated fair values of our senior notes and convertible
    subordinated notes are based on quoted market prices. The
    carrying value of remarketable debt approximates fair value due
    to the short-term nature of the attached interest rates. The
    fair value of our other debt is estimated using discounted cash
    flow analysis, based on rates we would currently pay for similar
    types of instruments.

18.

Business
    Combinations and Divestitures

Purchase
    Acquisitions

We continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are
    accretive to our solid waste operations. We have seen the
    greatest opportunities for realizing superior returns from

tuck-in

acquisitions, which are primarily the purchases of collection
    operations that enhance our existing route structures and are
    strategically located near our existing disposal operations.
    During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 we
    completed several acquisitions for a cost, net of cash acquired,
    of $32 million, $142 million, and $130 million,
    respectively.

Divestitures

The approximate aggregate sales price for divestitures of
    operations was $184 million in 2006, $172 million in
    2005 and $39 million in 2004. The proceeds from these sales
    were comprised substantially of cash. We recognized net gains on
    these divestitures of $44 million in 2006, $79 million
    in 2005 and $12 million in 2004.

Our 2006 divestitures have been made as part of our strategy to
    improve or divest certain under-performing and non-strategic
    operations. As of December 31, 2006, our current
    “Other assets” included $250 million of
    operations and properties held for sale. This balance is
    primarily attributable to our efforts to execute the strategy.
    As discussed in Note 3,

held-for-sale

assets are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or
    their fair value less the estimated cost to sell. Our
    “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and
    unusual items” for the year ended December 31, 2006
    also includes $18 million of charges associated with
    impairments required to record

held-for-sale

assets at their fair value. Additional information related to
    our divestiture activity is included in Note 12.

19.

Variable
    Interest Entities

We have financial interests in various variable interest
    entities. Following is a description of all interests that we
    consider significant. For purposes of applying FIN 46(R),
    we are considered the primary beneficiary of certain of these
    entities. Such entities have been consolidated into our
    financial statements as noted below.

Consolidated
    variable interest entities

Waste-to-Energy

LLCs

— On June 30, 2000, two limited
    liability companies (“LLCs”) were established to
    purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at
    three

waste-to-energy

facilities that we operate under an agreement with the owner.
    John Hancock Life Insurance Company (“Hancock”) has a
    99.5% ownership interest in one of the LLCs (“LLC I”),
    and the second LLC (“LLC II”) is 99.75% collectively
    owned by LLC I and the CIT Group (“CIT”). We own the
    remaining equity interest in each LLC. Hancock and CIT made an
    initial investment of $167 million in the LLCs. The LLCs
    used these proceeds to purchase the three

waste-to-energy

facilities that we operate and assumed the seller’s
    indebtedness related to these facilities. Under the LLC
    agreements, the LLCs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of
    any of the following events: (i) a written decision of all
    the members of the LLCs to dissolve, (ii) December 31,
    2063, (iii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution
    under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, or
    (iv) the LLCs ceasing to own any interest in the

waste-to-energy

facilities.

Income, losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based
    on their initial capital account balances until Hancock and CIT
    achieve targeted returns; thereafter, the earnings of LLC I will
    be allocated 20% to Hancock and 80% to us and the earnings of
    LLC II will be allocated 20% to Hancock and CIT and 80% to
    us. All capital allocations made through December 31, 2006
    have been based on initial capital account balances as the
    target returns have not yet been achieved. We are required under
    certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the LLCs
    in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss
    amounts and terminated values under the LLC agreements to the
    extent they are different from the underlying lease agreements.
    We believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of these
    circumstances is remote. Additionally, upon exercising certain
    renewal options under the



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

leases, we will be required to make payments to the LLCs for the
    difference between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal
    rents.

As of December 31, 2006, our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    includes $366 million of net property and equipment
    associated with the LLCs’

waste-to-energy

facilities, $43 million of debt associated with the
    financing of the facilities and $220 million in minority
    interest associated with Hancock and CIT’s interests in the
    LLCs.

Trusts for Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation
    Obligations

— We have determined that we are the
    primary beneficiary of trust funds that were created to settle
    certain of our closure, post-closure or environmental
    remediation obligations. As the trust funds are expected to
    continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were
    established, we do not believe that there is any material
    exposure to loss associated with the trusts. The consolidation
    of these variable interest entities has not materially affected
    our financial position or results of operations in 2006 or 2005.

Significant
    unconsolidated variable interest entities

Investments in Coal-Based Synthetic Fuel Production
    Facilities

— As discussed in Note 8, we own
    an interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production
    facilities. Along with the other equity investors, we support
    the operations of the entities in exchange for a pro-rata share
    of the tax credits generated by the facilities. Our obligation
    to support the facilities’ future operations is, therefore,
    limited to the tax benefit we expect to receive. We are not the
    primary beneficiary of either of these entities, and we do not
    believe that we have any material exposure to loss, as measured
    under the provisions of FIN 46(R), as a result of our
    investments. As such, we account for these investments under the
    equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the
    facilities. As of December 31, 2006, our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet includes $45 million of assets and
    $67 million of liabilities associated with our interests in
    the facilities.

Financial Interest in Surety Bonding Company

—
    During the third quarter of 2003, we issued a letter of credit
    in the amount of $28.6 million to support the debt of a
    surety bonding company established by an unrelated third party
    to issue surety bonds to the waste industry and other
    industries. The letter of credit served as a guarantee of the
    entity’s debt obligations. In 2003, we determined that our
    guarantee created a significant variable interest in a variable
    interest entity, and that we were the primary beneficiary of the
    variable interest entity under the provisions of FIN 46(R).
    Accordingly, we began consolidating this variable interest
    entity into our financial statements in the third quarter of
    2003.

During 2006, the debt of this entity was refinanced. As a result
    of the refinancing, our guarantee arrangement was also
    renegotiated, significantly reducing the value of our guarantee.
    We determined that the refinancing of the entity’s debt
    obligations and corresponding renegotiation of our guarantee
    represented significant changes in the entity that required
    reconsideration of the applicability of FIN 46(R). As a
    result of the reconsideration of our interest in this variable
    interest entity, we concluded that we are no longer the primary
    beneficiary of this entity. Accordingly, in April 2006, we
    deconsolidated the surety bonding company.

Segment
    and Related Information

We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and Recycling
    Groups. These six Groups are presented below as our reportable
    segments. Our segments provide integrated waste management
    services consisting of collection, disposal (solid waste and
    hazardous waste landfills), transfer,

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants that are
    managed by Wheelabrator, recycling services and other services
    to commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The
    operations not managed through our six operating Groups are
    presented herein as “Other.”

In the third quarter of 2005, we eliminated our Canadian Group,
    and the management of our Canadian operations was allocated
    among our Eastern, Midwest and Western Groups. The historical
    operating results of our

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Canadian operations has been allocated to the Eastern, Midwest
    and Western Groups to provide financial information that
    consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
    operations.

Our third quarter 2005 reorganization, as discussed in
    Note 11, also resulted in the centralization of certain
    Group office functions. The administrative costs associated with
    these functions were included in the measurement of income from
    operations for our reportable segments through August 2005, when
    the integration of these functions with our existing centralized
    processes was complete. Beginning in September 2005, these
    administrative costs have been included in income from
    operations of “Corporate and other.” The reallocation
    of these costs has not significantly affected the operating
    results of our reportable segments for the periods presented.

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable
    segments for the respective years ended December 31 is

Quarterly
    Financial Data (Unaudited)

Fluctuations in our operating results between quarters may be
    caused by many factors, including

period-to-period

changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of
    business and operating segment and general economic conditions.
    Our revenues and income from operations typically reflect
    seasonal patterns. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat
    higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume
    of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial
    and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also
    tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third
    quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect
    these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather
    conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the
    year, such as the hurricanes experienced during 2004 and 2005,
    actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However,
    for several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
    Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
    months, when electrical demand is generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements (Unaudited)

FIN 48 —
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109)

(“FIN 48”),
    which clarifies the relevant criteria and approach for the
    recognition, de-recognition and measurement of uncertain tax
    positions. FIN 48 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of
    FIN 48 to have a material impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently in the process
    of assessing the provisions of SFAS No. 157 and
    determining how this framework for measuring fair value will
    affect our current accounting policies and procedures and our
    financial statements. We have not determined whether the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact
    on our consolidated financial statements.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Effectiveness
    of Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed
    to ensure that information we are required to disclose in
    reports that we file or submit with the SEC is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified by the SEC. An evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
    of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
    as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
    to ensure that we are able to collect, process and disclose the
    information we are required to disclose in the reports we file
    with the SEC within required time periods.

Internal
    Controls Over Financial Reporting

Management’s report on our internal control over financial
    reporting can be found in Item 8 of this report. The
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s attestation
    report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting can also be found
    in Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data

, of this report.

Item 9B.

Other
    Information.

At the meeting of the Management Development and Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors on December 14, 2006,
    the Compensation Committee set the fiscal 2007 performance
    criteria for our executive officers for annual bonuses paid
    under our annual incentive plan. Pursuant to the criteria
    approved by the Committee, the executives’ target bonuses
    are based entirely on financial measures, although the Committee
    may exercise its discretion to increase or decrease an
    executives’ potential bonus by up to 25% based on personal
    performance. Additionally, the annual incentive plan provides
    that in no event will any award made under the plan exceed 0.5%
    of the Company’s pre-tax income from operations. Each of
    the executives is party to an employment agreement with the
    Company that sets forth such executive’s target incentive
    bonus, which ranges from 50% to 115% of the executives’
    annual base salary. Further, the agreements provide that the
    executives’ actual bonuses may range from zero to two times
    the target bonus, depending on the achievement of the goals set
    forth under the annual incentive plan.

The 2007 criteria set by the Committee consists of financial
    measures divided equally between an earnings per share measure,
    calculated for the Company applicable to all executives, and a
    cash flow target. For purposes of the performance criteria,
    “cash flow” is calculated as earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures.
    The cash flow targets are Company based for corporate executives
    and calculated for each individual Group for the Group
    executives. The Committee may, in its discretion, adjust actual
    results by eliminating charges for restructuring, extraordinary,
    unusual or non-recurring items, discontinued operations and
    cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles or changes
    in tax laws in determining whether the criteria have been met.

Also on December 14, 2006, the Committee determined to make
    changes to the awards issued as part of its long-term incentive
    program. Beginning in 2007, rather than granting an equal number
    of restricted stock unit awards and performance share unit
    awards to executives, the total value of the awards will be
    allocated 25% for restricted stock units and 75% performance
    share units. Additionally, rather than ratable vesting over a
    four-year period, 100% of the restricted stock units will vest
    at the end of a three-year service period.
