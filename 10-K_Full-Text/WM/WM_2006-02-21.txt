PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

The financial statements in this report represent the
consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
are the primary beneficiary. Waste Management, Inc. is a holding
company that conducts all of its operations through
subsidiaries. The terms “the Company,” “we,”
“us” or “our” refer to Waste Management,
Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable
interest entities. When we use the term “WMI,” we are
referring only to the parent holding company.

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
recycling, disposal and

waste-to

-energy
services. In providing these services, we actively pursue
projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive
difference for our environment, including recovering and
processing the methane gas produced naturally by landfills into
a renewable energy source. Our customers include commercial,
industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste
management companies, electric utilities and governmental
entities. During 2005, none of our customers accounted for more
than 1% of our operating revenue. We employed approximately
50,000 people as of December 31, 2005.

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving five key
stakeholders: our customers, our employees, the environment, the
communities in which we work, and our shareholders. Our goals
are:

WMI was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name
“USA Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a
Delaware company in 1995. In a 1998 merger, the Oakbrook,
Illinois based waste services company, formerly known as Waste
Management, Inc., became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI and
changed its name to Waste Management Holdings, Inc.
(“WM Holdings”). At the same time, our parent
company changed its name to Waste Management, Inc. Like WMI,
WM Holdings is a holding company that conducts all of its
operations through subsidiaries.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone
number at that address is (713) 512-6200. Our website

after we file the reports with the SEC. Our stock is traded on
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WMI.”

Strategy

We have been working to improve our organization by
concentrating on operational excellence and profitability rather
than on revenue growth. To accomplish this, we continuously
review our operations and identify our best practices, adopt
these best practices as the standards for all of our operating
units, and then work continuously to improve them.

We are focusing our attention on executing strategies based on
four objectives: revenue growth through pricing initiatives;
lowering operating and selling, general and administrative costs
through process standardi-



zation and productivity improvements; improving our portfolio of
assets through our “fix or seek exit strategy” program
and seeking acquisition candidates; and generating strong and
consistent cash flow from operations that can be returned to
shareholders.

Revenue Growth

Our current revenue growth and pricing excellence strategy
centers around attaining a return on invested capital that
appropriately captures our cost of capital, the risks we take in
our business and our unique disposal assets. We have been using
an increasingly more disciplined approach to pricing, where we
carefully analyze our operations and make decisions based on
market specific information including our costs. In 2005, this
was most clearly seen in our collection lines of business, where
we focused on new business pricing, minimizing price roll-backs,
and charging an environmental cost recovery fee and a revised
fuel surcharge. In addition, we have implemented fee programs to
recover the costs we incur for items such as the collection of
past due balances, container delivery and other services. In the
second quarter 2005, we expanded our landfill pricing study,
which was originally implemented in January 2005 to cover
30 landfills, to include 23 transfer stations and
essentially all of the operating sites in four of our Market
Areas. By the end of 2005, we had implemented our findings from
the study at nearly all of our landfills and transfer stations.
We believe our success in pricing, as demonstrated by our
increasing internal revenue growth, is a direct result of our
execution of these pricing strategies.

Cost Control

We remain committed to finding the best practices throughout our
organization and standardizing those practices and processes
throughout the Company. In the second half of 2005, our focus on
improving internalization rates, standardizing operating and
maintenance practices and emphasizing the importance of safety
translated into cost savings across our organization. We intend
to continue to identify operational improvements that will
provide cost reductions in 2006 and beyond. In some cases, we
have determined that to achieve these operational improvements
it is necessary to put in place new information systems or other
tools that will provide our people with the necessary resources
to make better decisions and work more efficiently. For example,
in the fourth quarter of 2005, we announced that we had entered
into agreements for new revenue management software and support
services. Although that decision required an asset impairment
charge, we believe that this system will provide the best
capabilities and functionality of the available alternatives.

Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005, we unveiled plans to
simplify and streamline our organizational structure. We
eliminated duplicative administrative functions that were in our
field and Corporate organization and eliminated one of our
reporting Groups and integrated those operations into our other
groups as a way to further reduce administrative costs and
improve efficiencies. This affirms our commitment to making the
choices that will benefit our Company in the long-term, which
includes improving the way we operate in order to achieve cost
savings.

Improve Operations through our Divestiture Program,
    Acquisitions and Investments

As announced in early 2005, we have been reviewing our
under-performing and non-strategic operations and assessing them
for opportunities to improve their performance. In the third
quarter of 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had
approved a plan to divest of under-performing operations
representing annual gross revenues of approximately
$400 million. The Company has since identified additional
operations, representing over $500 million in annual gross
revenues, that also may be divested as part of the program. The
ultimate sale of any of the operations is dependent on several
factors, including identifying interested purchasers,
negotiating the terms and conditions of the sales, and obtaining
regulatory approvals.

In addition to our focus on divesting under-performing
operations, we continue to look for acquisitions and other
investments to improve our current operations’ performance
and enhance and expand our services. In 2006, we expect to make
investments in our landfill

gas-to

-energy and
medical waste programs as well as



land purchases that we believe will benefit future expansion
efforts, all of which are complementary to our existing
operations.

Return Value to Stockholders

We continue to use the cash that we generate not only to
reinvest in our business, but also to return value to our
stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividend
payments. In late 2004, our Board of Directors approved our
current, three-year capital allocation program, which authorizes
up to $1.2 billion of combined stock repurchases and
dividend payments in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Under this program, we
repurchased over $700 million of shares and paid out
dividends of nearly $450 million in 2005. In December 2005,
our Board of Directors declared the first quarterly dividend
payment for 2006 of $0.22 per share, which is an increase
in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to allocate to
our dividend program for the third straight year. In January
2006, we repurchased over nine million shares through an
accelerated stock repurchase agreement, described in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

.

We plan to continuously seek out the best information from our
experiences, our employees and our customers, and develop
additional strategies, and additional ways to execute our
strategies, that will bring us closer to achieving our goals.
However, we believe that once a goal has been met, it is time to
set a new, higher goal so that we continue to build on the
momentum we have created through these strategies.

Operations

General

We provide integrated waste management services to commercial,
industrial, municipal and residential customers throughout the
United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. Our core business
includes collection, disposal, transfer,

waste-to

-energy and
recycling services. We manage and evaluate our operations
through six operating Groups, four of which are organized by
geographic area and the other two are organized by function. The
geographic Groups include our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and
Western Groups, and the two functional Groups are our
Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to

-energy
services, and our Recycling Group. We also provide additional
waste management services that are not managed through our six
Groups. These services include third-party sub-contracted
services managed by our national accounts organization, methane
gas recovery, portable toilet and fence rentals and other
miscellaneous services, and are presented in this report as
“Other.”

The table below shows the total revenues (in millions)
contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005. As discussed in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2004
and 2003 information has been presented in conformity with our
current year presentation. More information about our results of
operations by reportable segment is included in Note 20 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

included in this report.



The services we provide include collection, landfill (solid and
hazardous waste landfills), transfer, Wheelabrator

(waste-to

-energy
facilities and independent power production plants), recycling,
and other services, as described below. The following table

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins with a
vast waste collection network. Collection involves picking up
and transporting waste from where it was generated to a transfer
station or disposal site. We generally provide collection
services under two types of arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we
    have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the
    agreements are influenced by factors such as collection
    frequency, type of collection equipment furnished by us, type
    and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the
    disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general
    market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel
    containers to most of our customers to store their solid waste
    between

pick-up

dates.
    Containers vary in size and type according to the needs of our
    customers or restrictions of their communities and many are
    designed so that they can be lifted mechanically and either
    emptied into a truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a
    disposal site. By using these containers, we can service most of
    our commercial and industrial customers with trucks operated by
    only one employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract
    with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality or regional
    authority that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a
    portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises
    are typically for periods of one to five years. We also provide
    services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to
    households. The fees for residential collection are either paid
    by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or
    service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving
    the service.

Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories for solid
waste in North America and we have the largest network of
landfills in North America. Solid waste landfills are built and
operated on land with geological and hydrological properties
that limit the possibility of water pollution, and are operated
under prescribed procedures. A landfill must be maintained to
meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations. The
operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes
excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and
compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other inert
material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These
operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary
conditions, to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare
the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes.

All solid waste management companies must have access to a
disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. We believe it
is usually preferable for our collection operations to use
disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer
to as internalization, rather than using third party disposal
facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize
higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows.
The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to
as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including
competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste
deposited.

We also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the United
States. Under federal environmental laws, the federal government
(or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all
hazardous waste



landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained
the required permits, although some can accept only certain
types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also comply with
specialized operating standards. Only hazardous waste in a
stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be
deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous
waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these
treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials
from liquids and chemical treatments that transform wastes into
inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous
waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner
designed to provide long-term containment of waste. We also
operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated
hazardous wastes in liquid form by injection into deep wells
that have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of
fresh water to a point that is separated by other substantial
geological confining layers.

We owned or operated 277 solid waste and six hazardous waste
landfills at December 31, 2005 compared with 280 solid
waste landfills and six hazardous waste landfills at
December 31, 2004. The landfills that we operate but do not
own are generally operated under a lease agreement or an
operating contract. The differences between the two arrangements
usually relate to the owner of the landfill operating permit.
Generally, with a lease agreement, the permit is in our name and
we operate the landfill for its entire life, making payments to
the lessor, who is generally a private landowner, based either
on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received.
We are generally responsible for closure and post-closure
requirements under our lease agreements. For operating
contracts, the owner of the property, generally a municipality,
usually owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a
contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. The
property owner is generally responsible for closure and
post-closure obligations under our operating contracts.

Based on remaining permitted capacity as of December 31,
2005 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average
remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated
landfills is approximately 26 years. Many of our landfills
have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is
currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted
disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether
to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated
future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and
likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are currently
seeking expansion permits at 65 of our landfills for which we
consider expansions to be likely. Although no assurances can be
made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted
as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for
all owned or operated landfills is approximately 35 years
when considering remaining permitted capacity, the expansion
capacity we consider likely and projected annual disposal
volume. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the expected
remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can
be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown below

a)

Changes in engineering estimates result in either changes to the
    available remaining landfill capacity in terms of volume or
    changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting
    the number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates
    of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are
    reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of
    factors, including standard engineering techniques and
    site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste
    type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of
    years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, and
    anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or
    recirculation of landfill leachate. We continually focus on
    improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that
    include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit,
    optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing
    initial compaction through improved landfill equipment,
    operations and training. Additionally, future airspace
    utilization may be affected by changes in the types of waste
    materials received at our landfills.

b)

In 2005, the amount of landfill capacity was reduced by
    approximately 46 million tons, or approximately 1%, to
    reflect cumulative corrections to align the lives of nine of our
    landfills for accounting purposes with the terms of the
    underlying contractual lease or operating agreements supporting
    their operations.

The number of landfills we own or operate segregated by their
estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining
permitted and likely expansion capacity and projected annual
disposal volume as of December 31, 2005, was as follows:

We closed three landfills in 2005, divested of one landfill and
    added one permitted landfill due to a new contract.

(b)

These amounts include 2.6 million tons at December 31,
    2005 and 2.2 million tons at December 31, 2004 that
    were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial
    purposes and were generally redirected from the permitted
    airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are
    frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for
    composting and clean dirt for

on-site

construction
    projects.

(c)

The decline in the volume of waste received at our hazardous
    waste landfills in 2005 as compared with 2004 is generally
    attributable to increased competition at one of our six
    hazardous waste sites.

When a landfill we own or operate (i) reaches its permitted
waste capacity; (ii) is permanently capped and
(iii) receives certification of closure from the applicable
regulatory agency, management of the site, including for any
remediation activities, is generally transferred to our closed
sites management group. In addition to the 283 active landfills
we managed at December 31, 2005, we also managed 184 closed
landfills.

Transfer.

At December 31, 2005, we owned or operated
370 transfer stations in North America. We deposit waste at
these stations, as do other third-party waste haulers. The solid
waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume
and increase the density of the waste and transported by
transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is often critical to third party
haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in
close proximity to their collection operations. Fees charged to
third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type
and volume or weight of the waste transferred, the distance to
the disposal site and general market factors.

The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection
operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain
fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the
disposal of the waste we collect. It allows us to manage costs
associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks,
railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than
collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the
disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated
and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically
located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations;
and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer
of the waste to one of our disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do not own are
generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease
property from third parties. There are some instances where
transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for
municipalities. In most cases we own the permits and will be
responsible for all of the regulatory requirements in accordance
with the lease and operating agreements terms.

Wheelabrator.

Through Wheelabrator, we own or operate 17

waste-to

-energy
facilities and six independent power production plants
(“IPPs”) that are located in the Northeast and in
Florida, California and Washington.

At our

waste-to

-energy
facilities, solid waste is burned at high temperatures in
specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted
into high-pressure steam, which is either sold or used to
generate electricity. Our

waste-to

-energy
facilities are capable of processing up to 24,000 tons of solid
waste each day. In both 2005 and 2004, our

waste-to

-energy
facilities received 7.8 million tons of solid waste, or
approximately 21,300 tons per day.

Our IPPs convert various waste and conventional fuels into
steam, which is either sold or used to generate electricity. The
plants burn wood waste, anthracite coal waste (culm), tires,
landfill gas and natural gas. These facilities are integral to
the solid waste industry, disposing of urban wood, waste tires,
railroad ties and utility poles. Our anthracite culm facility in
Pennsylvania processes the waste materials left over from coal
mining operations from over half a century ago. Ash remaining
after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land damaged by
decades of coal mining.

Our

waste-to

-energy
facilities and IPPs sell steam to industrial and commercial
users. Steam that is not sold is used to generate electricity
for sale to electric utilities. Fees at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities and IPPs are generally subject to the terms and
conditions of long-term contracts. Interim adjustments to the
prices for



steam and electricity under these long-term contracts are made
for changes in market conditions such as inflation, natural gas
prices and other general market factors.

Recycling.

Our Recycling Group focuses on improving the
sustainability and future growth of recycling programs within
communities and industries. As of September 30, 2005, we
acquired the remaining minority interests in Recycle America
Alliance L.L.C., making our Recycling Group a wholly-owned
organization. In addition to our Recycling Group, our four
geographic operating Groups provide certain recycling services
that are embedded within the Groups’ other operations and
therefore not included within the Recycling Group’s
financial results.

Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the
waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition. Our
recycling operations include the following:

Recycling fees are influenced by frequency of collection, type
and volume or weight of the recyclable material, degree of
processing required, the market value of the recovered material
and other market factors.

Our Recycling Group purchases recyclable materials processed in
our MRFs from various sources, including third parties and other
operating subsidiaries of WMI. The cost per ton of material
purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport
the finished goods to our customers. The price our Recycling
Group pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a
“rebate” and is based upon the price we receive for
sales of finished goods and local market conditions. As a
result, higher commodity prices increase our revenues and
increase the rebates we pay to our suppliers.

Other.

We provide in-plant services, in which we
outsource our employees to provide full service waste management
to customers at their plants, through our Upstream division. Our
vertically integrated waste management operations allow us to
provide customers with full management of their waste, including
identifying recycling opportunities, minimizing their waste,
determining the most efficient means available for waste
collection and transporting and disposing of their waste.

We also develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial
use of landfill gas through our Waste Management Renewable
Energy Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste
decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill
gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be



gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy
resource, in the same category as wind, solar and geothermal
resources. Landfill gas is an important part of renewable energy
portfolios for communities, utilities and industries. We
actively pursue landfill gas beneficial use projects and at
December 31, 2005 we were producing commercial quantities
of methane gas at 95 of our solid waste landfills. At 59 of
these landfills, the processed gas is delivered to electricity
generators. The electricity is then sold to public utilities,
municipal utilities or power cooperatives. At 32 landfills,
the gas is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a
direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes such
as steam boilers, cement kilns and utility plants. At four
landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality
natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers.

In addition, we rent and service portable restroom facilities to
municipalities and commercial customers under the name
Port-O-Let

®

,
and provide street and parking lot sweeping services.

Competition

The solid waste industry is very competitive. Competition comes
from a number of publicly held solid waste companies, private
solid waste companies, large commercial and industrial companies
handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and
public and private

waste-to

-energy
companies. We also have competition from municipalities and
regional government authorities with respect to residential and
commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills. The
municipalities and regional governmental authorities are often
able to offer lower direct charges to the customer for the same
service by subsidizing the cost of the service through the use
of tax revenues and tax-exempt financing. Generally, however,
municipalities do not provide significant commercial and
industrial collection or waste disposal.

We compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees,
geographic location and quality of operations. Our ability to
obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other
companies own or operate their own landfills, to which they will
send their waste. We compete for collection accounts primarily
on the basis of price and quality of services. Operating costs,
disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the
geographic areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge
are determined locally, and typically vary by the volume and
weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of
handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to
final disposal sites, labor costs and amount and type of
equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense competition
based on quality of service and pricing. Under certain customer
service contracts, our ability to increase our prices or pass on
cost increases to our customers may be limited. From time to
time, competitors may reduce the price of their services and
accept lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market
share or to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts.

Employees

At December 31, 2005 we had approximately
50,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,500
were employed in administrative and sales positions and the
balance were in operations. Approximately 13,700 of our
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally
require the contracting party to demonstrate financial
responsibility for their obligations under the contract.
Financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or
retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits.
Municipal and governmental waste management contracts typically
require performance bonds or bank letters of credit to secure
performance. Various forms of financial assurance are also
required by regulatory agencies for estimated closure,
post-closure and remedial obligations at our landfills.

We establish financial assurance in different ways including
escrow accounts funded by revenues during the operational life
of a facility, letters of credit, surety bonds, trust
agreements, financial guarantees and



insurance. The instrument decision is based on several factors;
most importantly the jurisdiction, contractual requirements,
market factors and availability of capacity. The surety industry
shows signs of recovery and appears to be moving forward with
cautious optimism. The following table summarizes the various
forms and dollar amounts (in millions) of financial assurance
that we had outstanding as of December 31, 2005:

(f)

We use surety bonds and insurance policies issued by an
    affiliated entity, Evergreen National Indemnity Company
    (“Evergreen”), that we have a non-controlling interest
    in and as such account for under the cost method. Our
    contractual agreement with Evergreen does not specifically limit
    the amounts of surety bonds or insurance that we may obtain,
    making our financial assurance under this agreement limited only
    by the guidelines and restrictions of the surety and insurance
    industries.

(g)

In certain states, we use insurance policies as a form of
    financial assurance for our anticipated closure and post-closure
    obligations.

(h)

For several of our landfills, we deposit cash into restricted
    trust funds or escrow accounts that have been established to
    settle closure, post-closure and remedial obligations. Balances
    maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will
    fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements;
    (ii) the ongoing use of funds for qualifying closure,
    post-closure and remedial activities; (iii) acquisitions or
    divestitures of landfills; and (iv) changes in the fair
    value of the financial instruments held in the trust fund or
    escrow account.



(i)

Financial guarantees are provided on behalf of our subsidiaries
    to municipalities, customers and regulatory authorities. They
    are provided primarily to support our performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure activities.

The assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be
drawn and used to meet the closure, post-closure and remedial
obligations for which the trusts and escrows were established.
Other than these permitted draws on funds, virtually no claims
have been made against our financial assurance instruments in
the past, and considering our current financial position,
management does not expect there to be claims against these
instruments that will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial statements. In an ongoing effort to
mitigate the risks of future cost increases and reductions in
available capacity, we are continually evaluating various
options to access cost-effective sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

We also carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including
general liability, automobile liability, real and personal
property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and
officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and other
coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure
to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per
incident deductible under the related insurance policy. Our
general liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance
programs have per incident deductibles of $2.5 million,
$1 million and $20,000, respectively. Effective
January 1, 2006, we increased the per incident deductible
for our auto insurance programs to $1 million. We do not
expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental
or other contingency to be material to our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated insurance
liabilities as of December 31, 2005 are summarized in
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state
or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and
transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
are administered by the Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) and various other federal, state and local
environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and
safety agencies in the United States and various agencies in
Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations
to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have
the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose
civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.

Because the major component of our business is the collection
and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner,
a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related,
either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection
measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial
and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials
into the environment. There are costs associated with siting,
design, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective
actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and
post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition,
development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer
station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money
to obtain or maintain necessary required permits and approvals.
There cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or
maintain necessary governmental approvals. Once obtained,
operating permits are subject to modification, suspension or
revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with these and any
future regulatory requirements could require us to make
significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of
these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and
do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.

The primary United States federal statutes affecting our
business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended
    (“RCRA”), regulates handling, transporting and
    disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and delegates
    authority to states to develop programs to ensure the safe
    disposal of solid wastes. In 1991, the EPA issued its final
    regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA, which set forth minimum
    federal performance and design criteria for solid waste
    landfills. These regulations must be implemented by the states,
    although states can impose requirements that are more stringent
    than the Subtitle D standards. We incur costs in complying with
    these standards in the ordinary course of our operations.



•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), which is
    also known as Superfund, provides for federal authority to
    respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous
    substances into the environment that have created actual or
    potential environmental hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for
    addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for
    cleanup of disposal sites upon current and former site owners
    and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the
    site and transporters who selected the disposal site and
    transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not
    dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous substances;
    it can be based upon the release or threatened release, even as
    a result of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of
    hazardous substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other
    applicable statutes and regulations. Liability may include
    contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a
    CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved
    its liability to federal or state regulators in an
    administrative or judicially approved settlement. Liability may
    also include damage to publicly owned natural resources. We are
    subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or
    operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been
    disposed or as a generator or transporter of hazardous
    substances disposed of at other locations.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the “Clean
    Water Act”) regulates the discharge of pollutants into
    streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a
    variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites. If
    run-off from our operations may be discharged into surface
    waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain
    discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under
    certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in
    those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards
    for management of storm water runoff from landfills that require
    landfills to obtain storm water discharge permits. In addition,
    if a landfill or a transfer station discharges wastewater
    through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works, the
    facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the
    treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a
    landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may
    have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement
    wetlands. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and
    administrative penalties for violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased
    federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air
    pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the
    requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal
    solid waste landfills and large municipal

waste-to

-energy
    facilities. Standards have also been imposed on manufacturers of
    transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles).
    In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards and
    emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and
    existing large landfills. The regulations impose limits on air
    emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject
    most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain
    operating permitting requirements under Title V of the
    Clean Air Act, and, in many instances, require installation of
    landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions
    or to treat and utilize landfill gas on or off-site. In general,
    controlling emissions involves drilling collection wells into a
    landfill and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery
    system or combustion device. We are currently capturing and
    utilizing the renewable energy value of landfill gas at 95 of
    our solid waste landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued
    additional regulations that required affected landfills to
    prepare, by January 2004, startup, shutdown and malfunction
    plans to ensure proper operation of gas collection, control and
    treatment systems.

The EPA has issued new source performance standards and emission
    guidelines for large and small municipal

waste-to

-energy
    facilities, which include stringent emission limits for various
    pollutants based on Maximum Achievable Control Technology
    (“MACT”) standards. These sources are also subject to
    operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean
    Air Act. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise
    the MACT standards applicable to municipal

waste-to

-energy
    facilities every five years.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended
    (“OSHA”), establishes certain employer
    responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of
    recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury,
    compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety
    and



Health Administration, and various record keeping, disclosure
    and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of
    hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the
    handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The
    Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal
    agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects pertaining to
    safety, movement of hazardous materials, movement and disposal
    of hazardous waste and equipment standards. Various state and
    local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous
    waste and may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials
    in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations
that affect our operations. Sometimes states’ regulations
are stricter than comparable federal laws and regulations when
not otherwise preempted by federal law. Additionally, our
collection and landfill operations could be affected by
legislative and regulatory measures requiring or encouraging
waste reduction at the source and waste recycling.

Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws
that restrict the disposal, within the state, of solid waste
generated outside the state. While laws that overtly
discriminate against

out-of

-state waste have
been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less
overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. Additionally,
certain state and local governments have enacted “flow
control” regulations, which attempt to require that all
waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be
deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the United States Supreme
Court ruled that a flow control ordinance was unconstitutional.
However, other courts have refused to apply the Supreme Court
precedent in various circumstances. In addition, from time to
time, the United States Congress has considered legislation
authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes
on the importation of

out-of

-state or

out-of

-jurisdiction
waste. These congressional efforts have to date been
unsuccessful. The United States Congress’ adoption of
legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation
of

out-of

-state or

out-of

-jurisdiction
waste or certain types of flow control, the adoption of
legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the
state level, or the courts’ interpretation or validation of
flow control legislation could adversely affect our solid waste
management services.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted
“fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have
jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or
revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or
permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces
and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance
history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in
addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize
the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit
holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and
to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness,
unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder
has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating
policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for
disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of
regulations on our current and future operations.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

When we make statements containing projections about our
accounting and finances, plans and objectives for the future,
future economic performance or when we make statements
containing any other projections or estimates about our
assumptions relating to these types of statements, we are making
forward-looking statements. These statements usually relate to
future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or
other aspects of our operations or operating results. We make
these statements in an effort to keep stockholders and the
public informed about our business and have based them on our
current expectations about future events. You should view such
statements with caution. These statements are not guarantees of
future performance or events. All phases of our business are
subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of
which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone or
taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us and
could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately
turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to
update any forward-looking statement as a result of future
events or developments. The following discussion should be read
together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Outlined below are some of the risks that we face and that could
affect our business and financial position for 2006 and beyond.
However, they are not the only risks that we face. There may be
additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we
currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our
business and financial position.

The waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot
    successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial
    condition and operating results may be materially adversely
    affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental,
quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our
operations. In North America, the industry consists of large
national waste management companies, and local and regional
companies of varying sizes and financial resources. We compete
with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities
that maintain their own waste collection and disposal
operations. These counties and municipalities may have financial
competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to
them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them.
Also, such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control
or other restrictions that would give them a competitive
advantage.

In addition, competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales
volume or to win competitively bid contracts. When this happens,
we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or
retain our customers, resulting in a negative impact to our
yield on base business.

If we are unable to successfully manage our costs, our
    income from operations could be lower than expected.

In recent years, we have implemented several profit improvement
initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our
revenues, and continue to seek ways to reduce our selling,
general and administrative and operating expenses. While we have
generally been successful in reducing our selling, general and
administrative costs, managing subcontractor costs and managing
the effect of fuel price increases, these initiatives may not be
sufficient. Even as our revenues increase, if we are unable to
control variable costs or increases to our fixed costs in the
future, we will be unable to maintain or expand our margins. In
recent periods, rising employee-related costs and expenses,
including health care and other employee benefits such as
unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation have
negatively impacted our measures to reduce costs.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully
    implement our plans and strategies to improve margins and
    increase our income from operations

We have announced several programs and strategies that we have
implemented or planned to improve our margins and operating
results. For example, we have implemented price increases and
environmental fees and continue our fuel surcharge programs, all
of which have increased our internal revenue growth.
Additionally, we have announced plans to divest of
under-performing assets if we cannot improve their
profitability. It is possible that we may lose volumes as a
result of price increases or that we may not be able to increase
prices or pass on increased costs to all of our customers due to
contractual restraints. Additionally, we may not be able to
successfully negotiate the divestiture of under-performing
operations, which could result in asset impairments or the
continued operation of low margin businesses. If we are not able
to fully implement our plans for any reason, many of which are
out of our control, we may not see the expected improvements in
our income from operations or our operating margins.

The seasonal nature of our business and changes in general
    and local economic conditions cause our quarterly results to
    fluctuate, and prior performance is not necessarily indicative
    of our future results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer
months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
that tend to occur during the second half of the year can
actually increase our revenues in



the areas affected. However, for several reasons, including
significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
months, when electrical demand is generally lower, to perform
scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities.

Our business is affected by changes in national and general
economic factors that are also outside of our control, including
interest rates and consumer confidence. We have
$3.0 billion of debt as of December 31, 2005 that is
exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the
combined impact of our variable rate tax-exempt bonds and our
interest rate swap agreements. Therefore, any increase in
interest rates can significantly increase our expenses.
Additionally, although our services are of an essential nature,
a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of
waste generated, which decreases our revenues. We also face
risks related to other adverse external factors, such as the
ability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely
manner and the effect that significant claims or litigation
against insurance companies may have on such ability.

Any of the factors described above could materially adversely
affect our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally,
due to these and other factors, operating results in any interim
period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
an entire year, and operating results for any historical period
are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future
period.

We cannot predict with certainty the extent of future
    costs under environmental, health and safety laws, and cannot
    guarantee that they will not be material.

We could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage
to our properties or to the property of other landowners,
particularly as a result of the contamination of drinking water
sources or soil. Under current law, we could even be held liable
for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
the assets or operations involved. Also, we could be liable if
we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of
hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or
if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under
applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner.
Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, and
may in the future, become involved in a variety of legal and
administrative proceedings relating to land use and
environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in
which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to
    impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes
    involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to
    revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and

•

local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or
    governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or
    approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which
    we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or
    seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons
involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If
we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of
these proceedings could result in, among other things, material
increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material
charges for asset impairments.

The waste industry is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and any such regulations, or new regulations, could
    restrict our operations or increase our costs of operations or
    impose additional capital expenditures.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have
a substantial impact on our business. A large number of complex
laws, rules, orders and



interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety,
land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Among
other things, they may restrict our operations and adversely
affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows by imposing conditions such as:

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of
landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or
remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills
temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations
may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or
facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could
be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste
management facility, we must have various facility permits and
other governmental approvals, including those relating to
zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and
approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to
obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

Significant increases in fuel prices for any extended
    periods of time will increase our operating expenses and may
    increase our tax expense.

The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable, and can
fluctuate significantly based on international, political and
economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our
control, such as actions by OPEC and other oil and gas
producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and
environmental concerns. In the past two years, the
year-over-year changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have
ranged from an increase of 41% to a decrease of 2%. We need fuel
to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in
our landfill operations, and price escalations or reductions in
the supply will likely increase our operating expenses and have
a negative impact on income from operations and cash flows.
Additionally, as fuel prices increase, many of our vendors raise
their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We
have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset
increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass
through all of our increased costs and some customers’
contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs. We
may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising
costs of fuel, although there can be no assurances that we will
be able to do so or that such programs will be successful.

Additionally, our current effective tax rate is estimated to be
significantly lower than statutory tax rates due in part to
Section 29 tax credits we realize from our landfill gas
sales and investments in coal-based synthetic fuel partnerships.
The ability to earn Section 29 tax credits is tied to an
average benchmark oil price determined by the Internal Revenue
Service, and the credits are phased out as the benchmark average
price increases. Higher fuel prices or continued high fuel
prices will phase out our credits and increase our effective tax
rate, which will result in higher tax expense.

We have substantial financial assurance and insurance
    requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate
    financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance
    coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase
    our liabilities.

The amount of insurance required to be maintained for
environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements.
We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to
the coverage it would provide, and therefore, our coverages are
generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels.
We face the risk of incurring liabilities for environmental
damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to
cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of insurance
coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use
these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby allowing us to
manage our self-insurance exposure



associated with claims. To the extent our insurers were unable
to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims
were more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse
effect to our financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with
respect to environmental closure and post-closure liabilities,
we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on
insurance, including captive insurance, or fund trust and escrow
accounts. We currently have in place all financial assurance
instruments necessary for our operations. We do not anticipate
any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance
instruments in the future. However, we are aware of recent
increases in the cost of surety bonds and in the event we are
unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or
third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or
more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate
coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial
assurance. These types of financial assurance could be more
expensive to obtain, which could negatively impact our liquidity
and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as
they become due.

The possibility of disposal site developments, expansion
    projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain
    other events could result in a material charge against our
    earnings.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we
capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to
disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions,
software development costs and other projects. If a facility or
operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired,
a pending acquisition is not completed, a development or
expansion project is not completed or is determined to be
impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized
capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility,
acquisition or project. We reduce the charge against earnings by
any portion of the capitalized expenditures and advances that we
estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise.

In future periods, we may be required to incur charges against
earnings in accordance with this policy, or due to other events
that cause impairments. Depending on the magnitude, any such
charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

Our revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity
    prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable
materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which
are subject to significant price fluctuations. The majority of
the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers,
including old corrugated cardboard (“OCC”), and old
newsprint (“ONP”). We enter into commodity price
derivatives in an effort to mitigate some of the variability in
cash flows from the sales of recyclable materials at floating
prices. In the past three years, the year-over-year changes in
the quarterly average market prices for OCC ranged from a
decrease of as much as 37% to an increase of as much as 36%. The
same comparisons for ONP have ranged from a decrease of as much
as 17% to an increase of as much as 34%. These fluctuations can
affect future operating income and cash flows. Additionally, our
recycling operations offer rebates to suppliers, based on the
market prices of commodities we purchase. Therefore, even if we
experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for
commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase.

Additionally, there may be significant price fluctuations in the
price of methane gas, electricity and other energy related
products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas
recovery,

waste-to

-energy and
independent power production plant operations. The marketing and
sales of energy related products by our landfill gas and

waste-to

-energy
operations are generally pursuant to long-term sales agreements.
Therefore, market fluctuations do not have a significant effect
on these operations in the short-term. However, revenues from
our independent power production plants can be affected by price
fluctuations. In the past two years, the year-over-year changes
in the average quarterly electricity prices have ranged from
increases of as much as 12% to decreases of as much as 4%.



The development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill
    disposal and

waste-to

-energy
    facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full
    capacity.

Our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill
disposal, such as recycling and composting. In addition, some
state and local governments mandate recycling and waste
reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain
types of wastes, such as yard wastes, at landfills or

waste-to

-energy
facilities. Although such mandates are a useful tool to protect
our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste
going to landfills and

waste-to

-energy
facilities in certain areas, which may affect our ability to
operate our landfills and

waste-to

-energy
facilities at full capacity, as well as the prices that we can
charge for landfill disposal and

waste-to

-energy
services. Our recycling operations benefit from these mandates,
but those operations generally generate much lower margins than
our disposal operations.

Efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could
    divert management’s attention and increase our operating
    expenses.

Labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees,
and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain
groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by
unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements
with some of the groups. Additional groups of employees may seek
union representation in the future, and, if successful, the
negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert
management attention and result in increased operating expenses
and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable
collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages, including
strikes, could ensue. Depending on the type and duration of any
labor disruptions, our operating expenses could increase
significantly, which could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Currently pending or future litigation or governmental
    proceedings could result in material adverse consequences,
    including judgments or settlements.

We are currently involved in civil litigation and governmental
proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. The timing
of the final resolutions to these matters is uncertain.
Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these
matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either
of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting
our liquidity.

We are increasingly dependent on technology in our
    operations and if our technology fails, our business could be
    adversely affected.

We may experience problems with either the operation of our
current information technology systems or the development and
deployment of new information technology systems that could
adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion
of our operations until resolved. We have purchased a new
revenue management system and plan to begin piloting the system
in the second half of 2006. We may encounter problems in the
development or deployment of this system that could result in
significant errors in, or disruption of, our billing processes.
Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to
timely collect and report financial results in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

We may experience adverse impacts on our results of
    operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
    interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting
rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could
adversely affect our operating results or cause unanticipated
fluctuations in our operating results in future periods.

Unforeseen circumstances could result in a need for
    additional capital.

We currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for
capital expenditures, acquisitions and other cash expenditures
with our cash flows from operations and, to the extent
necessary, additional financings. However, materially adverse
events could reduce our cash flows from operations. Our Board of
Directors approved a capital allocation program that provides
for up to $1.2 billion in aggregate dividend payments and



share repurchases each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007 and
recently announced that it expects future quarterly dividend
payments to be $0.22 per share. If our cash flows from
operations were negatively affected, we could be forced to
reduce capital expenditures, acquisition activity, share
repurchase activity or dividend declarations. In these
circumstances we instead may elect to incur more indebtedness.
If we made such an election, there can be no assurances that we
would be able to obtain additional financings on acceptable
terms. In these circumstances, we would likely use our revolving
credit facility to meet our cash needs.

Our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial
covenants. In the event our interest expense is more than
expected due to higher interest rates or our ratio of debt to
earnings (as determined pursuant to the terms of the credit
facility) is more than expected, we may not be in compliance
with the covenants. This would result in a default under our
credit facility. If we were unable to obtain waivers or
amendments to the credit facility, the lenders could choose to
declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable,
which we may not be able to pay in full. Additionally, any such
default could cause a default under all of our other credit
agreements and debt instruments. Any such default would have a
material adverse effect on our ability to operate.

None.

Item 2.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we
lease approximately 390,000 square feet under leases
expiring at various times through 2010. Our operating Group
offices are in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois;
Atlanta, Georgia; Scottsdale, Arizona; Hampton, New Hampshire;
and Houston, Texas. We also have field-based administrative
offices in Phoenix, Arizona; Chicago, Illinois and Ontario,
Canada. We own or lease real property in most locations where we
have operations. We have operations in each of the fifty states
other than Montana and Wyoming. We also have operations in the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment consist of land (primarily
landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and
bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and
equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and
operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient
for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to
make investments in additional equipment and property for
expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with
future acquisitions. For more information, see

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) under the symbol “WMI.” The
following table sets forth the range of the high and low per
share sales prices for our common stock as reported on the NYSE:



On February 15, 2006, the closing sale price as reported on
the NYSE was $33.54 per share. The number of holders of
record of our common stock at February 15, 2006 was 17,426.

In October 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors
approved a capital allocation program providing for the
authorization of up to $1.2 billion of stock repurchases
and dividend payments annually for each of 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Under this program, we declared and paid quarterly cash
dividends of $0.20 per share each quarter in 2005 for a
total of $449 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005,
we also declared our first quarterly dividend for 2006 of
$0.22 per common share, which will result in a payment of
$122 million based on shares outstanding as of
December 31, 2005. This dividend will be paid on
March 24, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 6,
2006. In 2004, we declared and paid $0.1875 per share each
quarter for a total of $432 million and in 2003 we declared
and paid an annual dividend of $0.01 per share for a total
of $6 million.

In 2005, we repurchased 24.7 million shares of our common
stock for $706 million. All of the repurchases were made
pursuant to the capital allocation program mentioned above. The

This amount represents the weighted average price paid per

(b)

This disclosure is required by the SEC. For each period
    presented, the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be
    purchased under the program has been provided as of the end of
    such period. As discussed above, the amount of capital available
    for share repurchases during 2005 was $1.2 billion, net of
    dividends paid. During the nine months ended September 30,
    2005, we declared and paid $339 million in dividends and
    repurchased $583 million of our common stock. In
    determining the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be
    purchased, we have reduced the $1.2 billion capital
    allocation by these amounts as well as the $110 million of
    dividends that we declared and paid during the fourth quarter of
    2005. The “Total” amount available for repurchases
    under the plan is shown as zero because our capital allocation
    program, by its terms, provides for $1.2 billion in
    dividends and share repurchases in each year, which makes any
    unexpended portion of the $1.2 billion allocated for
    dividends and share repurchases in 2005 unavailable after the
    end of the year.

In 2004, we repurchased 16.5 million shares of our common
stock for $472 million, all of which was made pursuant to a
capital allocation program approved by our Board of Directors.
In 2003, we repurchased 22.1 million shares of our common
stock for $577 million pursuant to a Board approved plan.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our operations for the
three years ended December 31, 2005. This discussion may
contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based
on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We
discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual
results to differ from expectations in Item 1A,

Risk
Factors

. The following discussion should be read in light of
that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Overview

Waste Management is the leading provider of comprehensive waste
services in North America. Throughout 2005, we continued to
build a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality,
reliable service, safety and environmental protection. By
continuing to cultivate this reputation and focusing on quality
customer service, we accomplished our main financial objectives
for 2005 of strong earnings growth, margin expansion and
improved cash flow. We believe that our pricing initiatives,
which allowed us to grow our revenues by increasing our prices
while maintaining solid volumes, were largely responsible for
our improved financial performance. Significant financial
achievements during the year ended December 31, 2005
include:

Cash Flow

— Free cash flow is a non-GAAP
measure of financial performance that we include in our
disclosures because we believe the production of free cash flow
is an important measure of our liquidity and performance and
because we believe our investors are interested in the cash we
produce from non-financing activities that is available for our
acquisition program, share repurchase program, scheduled debt
reduction and the payment of dividends. The most comparable GAAP
financial measure to free cash flow is net cash provided by
operating activities. We calculate free cash flow as shown in
the table below (in millions):

The growth in our 2005 operating and free cash flow reflects the
current year improvements in our operating results, particularly
those contributed by our increase in revenue from price, which
is discussed below.

Internal Revenue Growth

— Internal revenue
growth, or IRG, is the change in our revenues from: base
business yield; commodities; electricity; fuel surcharges and
fees; and volumes. IRG is an important indicator of our
performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase
revenues from our existing operations. Our IRG for the year was
3.7% and consisted primarily of improvement in base business
yield and an increase in revenues related to our fuel surcharge
program. Revenue growth from yield on base business is the
combined effects on our revenues from the pricing activities of
our collection, transfer, disposal and

waste-to

-energy



operations, exclusive of volume changes. Our revenue growth from
base business yield includes not only price increases, but also
includes (i) price decreases to retain customers;
(ii) changes in average price from new and lost business;
and (iii) certain average price changes related to the
overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of
services provided and the geographic locations where our
services are provided. Our revenue growth from base business
yield for 2005 was 2.7%, which is an increase of
2 percentage points from the prior year. In addition, our
fuel surcharge program contributed $157 million, or 1.3%,
to revenue growth in 2005 compared with $53 million, or
0.5% in 2004. The revenues generated by the program in 2005
substantially recovered the increase in our operating costs
attributable to fuel.

Margin Improvement

— We use our net income as a
percentage of revenues and income from operations as a
percentage of revenues to gauge performance for employee
incentive awards and to determine the overall efficiency and
effectiveness of our operations and strategies. Our income
before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as
a percentage of revenues increased in 2005 to 9.0% from 7.4% in
2004. This increase is largely due to a tax benefit resulting
from tax audit settlements. Our income from operations as a
percentage of revenues decreased to 13.1% in 2005 from 13.6% in
2004 on an increase of $558 million in revenue. The
decrease was caused primarily by $110 million of additional
expenses in 2005 when compared with 2004 related to asset
impairments and unusual items and restructuring. Excluding asset
impairments and unusual items and restructuring charges for both
periods, our income from operations as a percentage of revenues
improved by 0.3 percentage points.

This improvement in our income from operations as a percentage
of revenues is primarily a result of our increased revenue on
essentially flat volumes. We experienced a $403 million
increase in our operating expenses from the prior year, but as a
percentage of revenue, the measure increased by only
0.3 percentage points, to 66%, as compared with 2004.
During the second half of 2005, our operating expenses as a
percentage of revenue improved by 0.4 percentage points
when compared with the comparable prior year period. With the
increased prices of fuel and other higher variable operating
costs, we believe that these are positive results brought about
primarily by our focus on implementing programs to recover our
own higher costs. Our selling, general and administrative
expenses in 2005 increased by $9 million, but as a
percentage of revenue actually decreased by 0.3 percentage
points to 9.8%. We achieved our goal of reducing selling,
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue to
below 10% as a result of both our revenue growth and our
restructuring to streamline our business. As a result of higher
revenues on relatively flat volumes, our depreciation and
amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by
0.3 percentage points as compared with the prior period.
Although there remains work to be done, we believe our 2005
operating margins demonstrate our pricing progress as well as
our continued efforts to improve the efficiency of our
operations.

Outlook for 2006

As part of our continuing efforts to improve our operations, we
have developed a program to divest under-performing and
non-strategic operations. In the third quarter of 2005, we
identified operations with annual gross revenues of over
$400 million for potential divestiture under this program.
We recently announced that we have identified additional assets,
representing over $500 million in annual gross revenues,
that may also be sold as part of the divestiture program. While
it is too early to assess the financial impact of the
divestitures, and whether there may be any material asset
impairments as a result of the program, we remain confident that
our “fix or seek an exit strategy” approach to any
under-performing operations will benefit our financial results
in the long term. Additionally, we are continuing our focus on
acquisitions and other investments. We intend to make
investments in those locations and lines of businesses that
offer superior margins and return on capital.

Our Company is proud of the accomplishments made in 2005. We are
focused on building on the momentum that we experienced this
year to continue to expand our operating margins, increase our
return on invested capital and generate strong cash flows.



Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment
    Financial Information

As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the following reclassifications have been made in
the accompanying financial statements to conform prior year
financial information with the current period presentation.

Cash balances

— During 2004, we began making
investments in auction rate securities and variable rate demand
notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled
maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. Through
December 31, 2004, we included these investments in
“Cash and cash equivalents.” As a result of guidance
issued in early 2005 associated with these types of securities,
we determined that these investments were more appropriately
classified as short-term investments, which are a component of
current “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Accordingly, in our accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements we have decreased our “Cash and cash
equivalents” and increased our current “Other
assets” by $19 million at December 31, 2004.

Gross purchases and sales of these investments are presented
within “Cash flows from investing activities” in our
Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, in our 2004 and 2003
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, relatively insignificant
purchases and sales of other short-term investments were
included on a net basis within “Cash flows from investing
activities — Other.” This additional activity is
now reflected within purchases and sales of short-term
investments in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

Segments

— As discussed in Notes 2 and 20
to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in the third quarter
of 2005, we eliminated our Canadian Group office, and the
management of our Canadian operations was allocated among our
Eastern, Midwest and Western Groups. We have allocated the
operating results of our Canadian operations to the Eastern,
Midwest and Western Groups for 2003, 2004 and the first half of
2005 to provide financial information that consistently reflects
our current approach to managing our operations. This
reorganization also resulted in the centralization of certain
Group office functions. The administrative costs associated with
these functions were included in the measurement of income from
operations for our reportable segments through August 2005, when
the integration of these functions with our existing centralized
processes was completed. Beginning in September 2005, these
administrative costs have been included in the income from
operations of our Corporate organization. The reallocation of
these costs has not significantly affected the operating results
of our reportable segments for the periods presented.

Certain other reclassifications have also been made in the
accompanying financial statements to conform prior year
information with the current period presentation. The
supplementary financial information included in this section has
been updated to reflect these changes.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates
and assumptions that affect our assets, liabilities,
stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make
these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
is used in the preparation of our financial statements is
dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high
degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable
of being readily calculated based on generally accepted
methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly
difficult to determine and we must exercise significant
judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates
and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of
uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and
self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described below.

Landfills

— The cost estimates for final
capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for
which we have responsibility are estimated based on our
interpretations of current requirements and proposed or
anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional
costs, pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(“SFAS No. 143”), based on the amount a
third party would charge us to perform such activities even when
we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate
the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event
and the timing of each final capping event and of closure and
post-closure activities. Because



landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are
measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques,
changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping
and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on
these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;



These criteria are initially evaluated by our field-based
    engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify
    potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our
    policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a
    specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of
    unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these
    circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a
    landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the
    Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of
    the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the
    65 landfill sites with expansions at December 31,
    2005, 16 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to
    approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Thirteen of
    these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer
    because legal, community or other issues could impede the
    expansion process. The remaining three landfills required
    approval primarily because the permit application processes
    would not meet the one or five year requirements, generally due
    to state-specific permitting procedures. When we include the
    expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we
    also include the projected costs for development, as well as the
    projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and
    closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization
    basis of the landfill.

After determining the costs at our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill
    amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream,
    geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the
    number of tons necessary to fill the available, permitted and
    likely expansion airspace relating to these costs and
    activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of
    tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as
    waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate
    per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets
    associated with each final capping event, for assets related to
    closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs
    capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per
    ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts
    change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be
significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
be significantly different than actual results, lower
profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or
higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the
opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will
receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is
determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be
considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill
asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If
it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion
permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the
expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— Under
current laws and regulations, we may have liability for
environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage
caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site.
Remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any
identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human
error not expected in the normal course of business. These costs
include potentially responsible party (“PRP”)
investigation, settlement, certain legal and consultant fees, as
well as costs directly associated with site investigation and
clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs
directly related to the remedy. We estimate costs required to
remediate sites where liability is probable based on
site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
of years we were connected with the site. Next, we review the
same information



with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the
cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our
internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or
other service providers. Internally developed estimates are
based on:

Asset Impairments

— Our long-lived assets,
including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our
financial statements based on their cost less accumulated
depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards
require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they
become impaired. If significant events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or
asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of
recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or
asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If
cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for
a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has
occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the
projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of
undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any
impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset
group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either
an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis
of the asset or asset group or an actual third-party valuation.
If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be
less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an
impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the
period that the impairment indicator occurs.

Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include:

If any of these or other indicators occur, we review the asset
to determine whether there has been an impairment. Several of
these indicators are beyond our control, and we cannot predict
with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Additionally,
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and
our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized.
There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills
and goodwill, as described below.

Landfills — Certain of the indicators listed above
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of our business and not necessarily
    be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature
    of the waste industry.



Goodwill — At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. Upon determining the existence of goodwill
    impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by
    which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting
    the fair value of our reporting unit’s (Group’s)
    identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the
    reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just
    been acquired and the purchase price were being initially
    allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on
    an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in
    circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate
    that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been
    impaired.

Self-insurance reserves and recoveries

— We
have retained a portion of the risks related to our automobile,
general liability and workers’ compensation insurance
programs. Our liabilities associated with the exposure for
unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but
not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance
of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and
historical trends and data. Our estimated accruals for these
liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate
obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of
future incidents are significantly different than what we
assume. Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded
liabilities are recorded as assets when we believe that the
receipt of such amounts is probable.

Operating Revenues

Our operating revenues in 2005 were $13.1 billion, compared
with $12.5 billion in 2004 and $11.6 billion in 2003.
We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator (which
includes our

waste-to

-energy
facilities and independent power production plants, or IPPs) and
Recycling Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable
segments. Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to
revenues during each year from our six operating Groups and our
Other waste services:

Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling
services. Some of the fees we charge to our customers for
collection services are billed in advance; a liability for
future service is recorded when we bill the customer and
operating revenues are recognized as services are actually
provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of
tipping fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume
and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities
and are normally billed monthly or semi-monthly. Fees charged at
transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste
deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting
and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site, and are
normally billed monthly. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on
the type and volume of waste received at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and
steam. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling
Group as well as our four geographic operating Groups, generally
consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties
and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations
have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

The mix of operating revenues from our different services is
reflected in the table below (in millions):

The following table provides details associated with the

period-to

-period change
in revenues (in millions) along with an explanation of the
significant components of the current period changes:

Base Business

— In 2005, base business yield
improvements were driven by our collection operations, where we
experienced substantial revenue growth in every geographic
operating group. The significant base business yield
improvements in the collection line of business are primarily
the result of our continued focus on pricing initiatives as a
means of increasing our margins, cash flows and return on
capital and, to a lesser extent, the adoption of a 1%
environmental cost recovery fee, which increased revenues by
$33 million during 2005. Our transfer business in the East
and municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the
South have also provided significant revenue growth from base
business yield improvements throughout the year.

During the second half of 2005, we received substantial yield
contributions to revenues from our

waste-to

-energy
facilities. These revenue improvements were largely due to
significant increases in the rates charged for electricity under
our long-term contracts with electric utilities. These rates are
generally indexed to natural gas prices, which increased
significantly in 2005 as a result of hurricane related
production disruptions, increased demand and increases in crude
oil prices.

The 2005 revenue improvements attributable to yield have been
partially offset by a general decline in yield in special waste
landfill disposal operations, noted principally in our Midwest
and Southern Groups.

In 2004, base business yield improvements contributed to
increased revenues in our collection, transfer and

waste-to

-energy
operations. In our collection business, the most substantial
yield improvements during 2004 were in our industrial and
residential operations, where nearly all of our operating groups
experienced base business pricing improvements. Although the
change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout
2004 was positive, it was affected by increased price
competition, particularly in the Midwest, and the unfavorable
impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs
in the South. The base business yield improvements in our
transfer business throughout 2004 were almost exclusively
attributable to the Eastern portion of the United States.

Base business yield increases during 2004 were partially offset
by average yield declines in our landfill operations. This
decline was primarily the net result of the continued impact of
lower pricing for special waste, particularly in the South and
Midwest, which was partially offset by increased pricing for
municipal solid waste disposal.

Commodity

— Our revenues in 2005 declined due
to price decreases in recycling commodities. Average prices for
old corrugated cardboard dropped by 8% during the year, from
$85 per ton in 2004 to $78 per ton in 2005. Average
prices for old newsprint were also down by about 3%, from
$86 per ton in 2004 to $83 per ton in 2005.
Conversely, our revenues in 2004 were positively affected by
price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we
process.



A significant portion of revenues attributable to commodities is
rebated to our suppliers of recyclable materials. Accordingly,
changes in our revenues due to fluctuations in commodity prices
have a corresponding impact on our cost of goods sold.

Fuel surcharges and fees

— Fuel surcharges
increased revenues year-over-year by $157 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005 and $53 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 due to our continued effort to
pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel
surcharges. The substantial current year increases in revenue
provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be
attributed to (i) increases in market prices for fuel;
(ii) an increase in the number of customers who participate
in our fuel surcharge program; and (iii) the revision of
our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter
of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed
on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors. During the year
ended December 31, 2005, increased operating costs due to
higher diesel fuel prices, which are included within both

Operating Expenses — Subcontractor Costs

and

Operating Expenses — Fuel

, were substantially
recovered by our fuel surcharge program.

Volume

— Volume-related revenues are relatively
flat when comparing 2005 with 2004. This is generally because of
the combined impacts of (i) a decline in revenues
associated with hurricanes; (ii) increases in recycling and
landfill disposal volumes; and (iii) lower revenue from
residential, commercial and industrial collection volumes,
particularly in the East and Midwest, which can generally be
attributed to our focus on improving our margins by increasing
yield.

Our volume-related revenues generated from hurricane related
services were $56 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005 as compared with $115 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The $59 million
decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain
of our operations in the Gulf Coast region during 2005 as a
result of the severe destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. In
addition, much of our 2004 hurricane related revenues were
associated with subcontracted services, which generated
comparatively lower margins. In 2005, we generally elected not
to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not
support the required services with internal resources.

When excluding the impacts of the hurricanes, revenue due to
volume increased $62 million, or 0.5% during 2005. Current
year volume-related revenue increases have largely been due to
(i) increased recycling volumes provided by several new
brokerage contracts; (ii) increased landfill disposal
volumes in the Midwest, West and South; (iii) increased
transfer station volumes in the West and the South; and
(iv) increased residential collection volumes in the West.
Also included as a component of volume-related revenue growth is
revenue generated from our construction of an integrated waste
facility on behalf of a municipality in our Midwest Group. The
revenue generated by this project was low margin and largely
offset by a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold

.

These revenue increases were largely offset by volume declines
experienced in each line of business in the Eastern portion of
the United States and significant volume declines in our
collection business in the Midwest. We believe volume declines
in our collection and transfer businesses in the East and
Midwest can generally be attributed to our focus on improving
base business yield and the price competition typical in these
regions.

During 2004, we experienced significant volume-related revenue
increases in our collection and landfill businesses. A
substantial portion of volume-related revenue growth was due to
the volume increases experienced in industrial collection
operations for each of our operating Groups. In the Southern and
Western portions of the United States, our residential
collection, transfer, construction and demolition disposal and
special waste landfill disposal operations also made substantial
contributions to revenue growth throughout 2004.

Acquisitions and divestitures

— During the year
ended December 31, 2005, acquisitions contributed
$112 million of additional revenues offset by a decline in
revenue of $62 million during the year as a result of
divestitures. We expect the decrease in revenues attributable to
divestitures to increase in future periods as a result of our
plan to divest under-performing or non-strategic operations.

In 2004, the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was
largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of
collection assets from Allied Waste Industries, Inc. in the
third and fourth quarters of 2003. Other acquisitions of
recycling, transfer and

waste-to

-energy
businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of 2003
also provided increases in revenues during 2004.



Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and
    Amortization Shown Below)

Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related
benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and
repairs included below), which include salaries and wages,
related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the
costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and
disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third party
disposal facilities and transfer stations;
(iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment,
vehicles and facilities and related labor costs;
(iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of
independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal
facilities; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily
the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling
commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of
fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating
equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes,
which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host
community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill operating
costs, which include landfill remediation costs, leachate and
methane collection and treatment, other landfill site costs and
interest accretion on asset retirement obligations;
(ix) risk management costs, which include workers’
compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other
operating costs, which include, among other costs, equipment and
facility rent and property taxes.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency
translation, for the year ended December 31 for the
respective periods (in millions):

Labor and related benefits

— When comparing
2005 with 2004, these costs have increased due to
(i) salary and wage increases as a result of annual merit
increases; (ii) a general increase in employee health care
and benefit costs; (iii) an increase in the costs
attributable to contract labor used at our material recovery
facilities due to acquisitions; and (iv) increased payroll
taxes. In 2004, the year-over-year increase in costs was
generally due to higher salary costs and higher hourly wage and
overtime costs.

For purposes of the above disclosure, the presentation of prior
years has been conformed to our current year presentation that
excludes labor costs related to fleet and container maintenance
facilities as well as workers’ compensation costs. Labor
costs attributable principally to our fleet and container
maintenance facilities of $395 million for 2004 and
$376 million for 2003 have been reclassified as a component
of the caption “Maintenance and repairs,” and
workers’ compensation costs of $131 million for 2004
and $139 million for 2003 have been included as a component
of the caption “Risk management.”

Transfer and disposal costs

— In 2005, the
costs incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste
at third party transfer stations or landfills declined due to
our focus on improving internalization. These costs
significantly increased in 2004 as compared with 2003 due
principally to volume increases from both general operating
activities and acquisitions.

Maintenance and repairs

— Increases in these
costs are attributable to (i) higher parts and supplies
costs, which were driven by changes in the scope of maintenance
projects at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities and



increased volumes in our Southern and Western Groups;
(ii) increases in the cost of lubes and oils; and
(iii) increases in the labor costs associated with our
maintenance and repairs.

Subcontractor costs

— Throughout 2005 and 2004
we have experienced increases in subcontractor costs due to
higher diesel fuel prices, which drive the fuel surcharges we
pay to third party subcontractors. Subcontractor cost increases
attributable to higher fuel costs were significantly offset by
the revenue generated from our fuel surcharge program, which is
reflected as fuel yield increases within

Operating
Revenues

.

Additionally, in 2005 we incurred additional transportation
costs due to increased volumes in subcontracted work,
particularly in our National Accounts organization and Western
Group. The current year cost increases were partially offset by
a year-over-year decline in the utilization of subcontractors to
assist in providing hurricane related services.

In addition to the significant increase in subcontractor costs
related to hurricane-related services during 2004, we also
experienced increases due to (i) the impact of
acquisitions; (ii) increased third-party transportation
costs in our Western Group due to the service requirements of
certain event work; and (iii) additional transportation
costs in our Eastern Group due to capacity constraints at some
of our landfills.

Cost of goods sold

— These costs are primarily
for rebates paid to our suppliers, which are driven by the
market prices of recyclable commodities. In 2005, we experienced
lower market prices for recyclable commodities than in prior
years. This decrease in pricing was more than offset by
increased recycling volumes in 2005 due to several new brokerage
contracts and recent acquisitions. In 2005, the increase in cost
of goods sold was also partially due to costs incurred to
construct an integrated waste facility for a municipality in the
Midwest Group. The increase in 2004 over 2003 is directly
related to the year-over-year increase in market prices of
recyclable commodities.

Fuel

— We experienced an average increase of
$0.59 per gallon for 2005 as compared with 2004 and in 2004
we experienced an average increase of $0.30 per gallon for
2004 over 2003. While we recover a significant portion of the
cost increases incurred as a result of higher fuel prices
through our fuel surcharge program, increased fuel costs
continue to negatively affect our operating margins. Revenues
generated by our fuel surcharge program are reflected as fuel
yield increases within

Operating Revenues.

Disposal and franchise fees and taxes

— These
cost increases are the result of increased volumes and increased
rates for mandated fees and taxes. Certain of these cost
increases are passed through to our customers, and have been
reflected as fee yield increases within

Operating
Revenues.

Landfill operating costs

— These cost increases
have generally been related to higher site maintenance, leachate
collection, monitoring and testing, and closure and post-closure
expenses.

Risk management

— Over the last two years, we
have been successful in maintaining these costs at a consistent
level largely due to reduced workers’ compensation costs,
which can partially be attributed to our continued focus on
safety and reduced accident and injury rates.

Other operating expenses

— The increase in
these costs since 2004 can be attributed to (i) Hurricane
Katrina related support costs, particularly in Louisiana, where
we built Camp Waste Management to house and feed hundreds of our
employees who worked in the New Orleans area to help with the
cleanup efforts; (ii) a year-over-year decrease in the
realization of gains on sales of assets; (iii) costs
incurred during 2005 attributable to labor strikes in New Jersey
and Canada; and (iv) an increase in costs generated by a
surety bonding company we have consolidated since the third
quarter of 2003 under the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46”).

The primary reason for the decrease during 2004 as compared with
2003 is the December 31, 2003 consolidation of two special
purpose type variable interest entities, from which we lease
three

waste-to

-energy
facilities. The consolidation of these entities is as a result
of our FIN 46 implementation. Prior to the consolidation of
these entities, we accounted for these arrangements as operating
leases. The consolidation of these entities, therefore, resulted
in a decline in rental expense in 2004, which was mostly offset
by increases in depreciation, interest expense and minority
interest expense.



Selling, General and Administrative

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
(i) labor costs, which include salaries, related insurance
and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based
compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees
for consulting, legal, audit and tax services;
(iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances
for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and
(iv) other general and administrative expenses, which
include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and
data telecommunications, advertising, travel and entertainment,
rentals, postage and printing.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended
December 31 for the respective periods (in millions):

Labor and related benefits

— Throughout 2005 we
experienced increases in (i) non-cash compensation costs
associated with recent changes in equity-based compensation
provided for by our long-term incentive plan and (ii) group
insurance costs largely due to general health care cost
increases. In both 2005 and 2004, these costs increased
year-over-year due to higher salaries and hourly wages driven by
annual merit raises as well as higher bonus expense due to the
overall improvement in our performance on a year-over-year
basis. Also contributing to the increase in labor costs in 2004
when compared with 2003 was an increase in commissions paid to
our sales personnel. Declines in our use of contract labor,
particularly for Corporate support functions, partially offset
these cost increases for both 2005 and 2004. Additionally,
during the second half of 2005 we began to realize the benefits
of our July 2005 reorganization, which simplified our management
structure to increase the accountability and responsibility of
our Market Areas. Our ability to streamline our organization in
this manner can be attributed to our continued focus on creating
efficiencies with our key personnel. Our 2005 and 2003
restructurings have been a result of identifying the most
effective utilization of our resources, and are discussed in the

Restructuring

section below.

Professional fees

— In 2004, we experienced an
increase in professional fees as a result of higher litigation
and defense costs as well as consulting fees that were largely
due to our implementation of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The decline in our litigation and
defense costs in the current year is due to several cases
winding down and either being settled or moving into the
settlement stages. Consulting costs associated with
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance have also decreased as we move from
the implementation phase to continued monitoring and testing. In
2005, an increase in consulting fees related to our pricing
initiatives and an increase in our computer support costs have
partially offset these reductions.

Provision for bad debts

— As a percentage of
revenue, these costs have continued to decline largely due to
improved collection efforts. The increase in these costs in 2005
was generally attributable to a year-over-year increase in
third-party collection costs.

Other selling, general and administrative
costs

— Although we did not see a significant
fluctuation in these costs when comparing 2005 with 2004,
increased sales and marketing costs related to our national
advertising campaign did result in a notable increase in these
expenses in the current year. The recognition of favorable
settlements for legal disputes during 2003 drove the increase in
these costs from 2003 to 2004.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of
property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital
leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years;
(ii) amortization of landfill costs,



including those incurred and all estimated future costs for
landfill development, construction, closure and post-closure, on
a

units-of

-consumption
method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated
remaining capacity of a site; (iii) amortization of
landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping
obligations on a

units-of

-consumption
method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity
associated with each final capping event; and
(iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite
life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a
straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related
agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the
type of asset.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
$25 million during the year ended December 31, 2005.
This increase is largely attributable to a $21 million
charge to landfill amortization recorded to adjust the
amortization periods of nine of our landfills. These adjustments
reflect cumulative corrections resulting from reducing the
amortization periods of the landfills and were necessary to
align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with
the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting
their operations. We determined that the impact of these
adjustments was not material to 2005 or prior periods’
results of operations.

Our 2005 landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement
cost amortization also increased when compared with 2004 as a
result of the comparative impact of landfill amortization
reductions recorded in each year for changes in estimates
related to our final capping, closure and post closure
obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, landfill amortization expense was reduced by
$12 million and $20 million, respectively, with the
majority of the reduced expense resulting from revised estimates
associated with final capping changes. Similar adjustments did
not significantly affect our landfill amortization expense in
2003.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
$71 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared with 2003. The increase in depreciation and
amortization in 2004 was primarily related to (i) an
increase in our landfill amortization rate, net of the
adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs, of
$0.19 per ton, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in
landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes;
(ii) increased information technology depreciation expense
recognized as a result of placing additional enterprise-wide
software systems into service during the latter half of 2003;
and (iii) increased depreciation expense for our
Wheelabrator Group as a result of consolidating two variable
interest entities.

Restructuring

Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if
we are operating under the most advantageous structure. These
reviews have highlighted efficiencies and cost savings we could
capture by restructuring. The most significant cost savings we
have obtained through our restructurings have been attributable
to the labor and related benefits component of our
“Selling, general and administrative” expenses. The
following summarizes the organizational changes that have
occurred during the last three years to reach our current
structure.

In February 2003, we reduced the number of market areas that
make up our geographic operating Groups and reduced certain
overhead positions to streamline our organization. As a result,
we incurred $20 million in one-time employee severance and
benefit costs. The operational efficiencies provided by the
February 2003 organizational changes enabled us to further
reduce our workforce in June 2003. We recorded an additional
$24 million of pre-tax charges for employee severance and
benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during
2003. In 2004, we recorded a $1 million credit to reduce
our accrual for severance costs associated with the 2003
workforce reductions.

During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified
our organizational structure by eliminating certain support
functions performed at the Group or Corporate office. We also
eliminated the Canadian Group office, which reduced the number
of our operating groups from seven to six. This reorganization
has reduced costs at the Group and Corporate offices and
increased the accountability of our Market Areas. We recorded
$28 million of pre-tax charges for costs associated with
the implementation of the new structure, principally for
employee severance and benefit costs.

The significant transactions and events resulting in asset

statement impacts within “Asset impairments and unusual
items” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during
the three years ended December 31, 2005 are discussed below:

Year Ended December 31, 2005

Asset impairments

— During the second quarter
of 2005, we recorded a $35 million charge for the
impairment of the Pottstown Landfill located in West Pottsgrove
Township, Pennsylvania. We determined that an impairment was
necessary after the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board
upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection of a permit application for a vertical expansion at
the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the Company reviewed
the options available at the Pottstown Landfill and the
likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options. After such
evaluation and considering the length of time required for the
appeal process and the permit application review, we decided not
to pursue an appeal of the permit denial. This decision was
primarily due to the expected impact of the permitting delays,
which would hinder our ability to fully utilize the expansion
airspace before the landfill’s required closure in 2010. We
continued to operate the Pottstown Landfill using existing
permitted airspace through the landfill’s permit expiration
date of October 2005. The Pottstown Landfill had not been a
significant contributor to our recent earnings nor do we expect
the expansion denial to have a material adverse effect on our
future results of operations or cash flows.

Through June 30, 2005, our “Property and
equipment” had included approximately $80 million of
accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system.
Approximately $59 million of these costs were specifically
associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts
required to develop and configure that software for our use,
while the remaining costs were associated with the general
efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our
existing applications and hardware. The development efforts
associated with our revenue management system were suspended in
2003. Since that time, there have been changes in the viable
software alternatives available to address our current needs.
During the third quarter of 2005, we concluded our assessment of
potential revenue management system options. As a result, we
entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the
license, implementation and maintenance of certain of its
applications software, including waste and recycling
functionality. We believe that these newly licensed
applications, when fully implemented, will provide substantially
better capabilities and functionality than the software we were
developing. Our plan to implement this newly licensed software
resulted in a $59 million charge in the third quarter of
2005 for the software that had been under development and
capitalized costs associated with the development efforts
specific to that software.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an
$18 million charge for asset impairments. This charge was
primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our
Eastern Group, as a result of a change in our expectations for
future expansions, and the impairment of capitalized software
costs related to two applications we decided not to develop
further.

Net gains on divestitures

— During the first
quarter of 2005, we recognized a $39 million gain as a
result of the divestiture of a landfill in Ontario, Canada,
which was required as a result of a Divestiture Order from the
Canadian Competition Bureau. During the remainder of 2005, we
recognized a total of $40 million in



gains as a result of the divestiture of operations. With the
exception of our divestiture of the Ontario, Canada landfill,
our divestitures during 2005 were generally part of our plan to
review under-performing or non-strategic operations and to
either improve their performance or dispose of the operations.

Total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended
December 31, 2005 were $172 million, of which
$140 million was received in cash, $23 million was in
the form of a note receivable and $9 million was in the
form of non-monetary assets. We do not believe that these
divestitures are material either individually or in the
aggregate and we do not expect these divestitures to materially
affect our consolidated financial position or future results of
operations or cash flows.

Other

— During the first quarter of 2005, we
recognized a charge of approximately $16 million for the
impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of
stockholders that opted not to participate in the 2000
settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us
related to 1998 and 1999 activity. During the third quarter of
2005, we settled our ongoing defense costs and any future
indemnity obligations for four former officers of
WM Holdings related to legacy litigation brought by the SEC
against such former officers. As a result, we recorded a
$26.8 million charge for the funding of the court ordered
distribution to our shareholders for the former officers’
settlement of the litigation. As discussed in Note 10 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements, this settlement agreement
resulted in a distribution of $27.5 million to WMI
shareholders of record as of August 25, 2005.

These charges were partially offset by the recognition of a
$12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended
December 31, 2005, which was primarily for adjustments to
our receivables and estimated obligations for non-solid waste
operations divested in 1999 and 2000.

Year Ended December 31, 2004

For 2004, the significant items included within “Asset
impairments and unusual items” were
(i) $17 million in impairment losses primarily due to
the impairment of certain landfill assets and software
development costs; (ii) $12 million in gains on
divestitures that primarily related to certain
Port-O-Let

®

operations; and (iii) $18 million in miscellaneous net
gains, which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated
obligations associated with non-solid waste services, which were
divested in 1999 and 2000.

Year Ended December 31, 2003

For 2003, the significant items included within “Asset
impairments and unusual items” were $5 million in
impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain
landfill assets and $13 million in gains on divestitures
that primarily related to divested operations in the Western
Group.

Income From Operations by Reportable Segment

The following table summarizes income from operations by
reportable segment for the year ended December 31 for each
respective period and provides explanations of factors
contributing to the significant changes in our segments’
operating results (in millions):



Eastern

— Operating income was relatively flat
when comparing 2005 with 2004. Current year operating income has
been favorably affected by base business yield improvement,
particularly in the collection and transfer lines of business
and recent tuck-in acquisitions. These operational improvements
were offset by (i) the recognition of a net charge of
$44 million to “Asset impairments and unusual
items,” which was driven by the impairment of the Pottstown
Landfill, and (ii) additional operating costs of
$9 million attributable to a seven-week labor strike in New
Jersey in the first quarter of 2005. In addition, our focus on
improving base business yield has resulted in partially
offsetting volume declines during 2005, which reflects the
competitive nature of the region and our decision to concentrate
on higher margin revenues.

The improvement in operating income from 2003 to 2004 was driven
primarily by (i) revenue growth due to increased average
yield across all major lines of business, partially offset by
volume declines in transfer, residential collection and landfill
operations throughout the year; (ii) higher operating
expenses incurred in 2003 as compared with 2004 due to the first
quarter’s harsh weather conditions; and
(iii) acquisitions. These earnings improvements were
partially offset by increased costs for labor and the
transportation of waste, higher landfill amortization rates and
the impairment of a landfill.

Midwest

— The current year increase in income
from operations was primarily due to revenue growth associated
with increased base business yield for the collection line of
business, which was driven principally by residential collection
operations. Also positively affecting results compared with the
prior year was a decline in landfill amortization expense
generally as a result of changes in certain estimates related to
our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.
However, our focus on improving base business yield has resulted
in partially offsetting volume declines during 2005.

Operating income between 2003 and 2004 was relatively flat. The
slight increase in operating income in 2004 can largely be
attributed to higher operating expenses incurred in the first
quarter of 2003 due to harsh winter weather conditions.

Southern

— Strong internal revenue growth
contributed significantly to the increase in income from
operations during 2005. The most significant revenue growth was
associated with base business yield improvements in the
collection line of business and volume-related revenue growth in
the transfer and landfill disposal lines of business. In
addition, $13 million of the increase in income from
operations was attributable to gains recognized on the
divestiture of operations during 2005. These increases were
partially offset by (i) a decline in earnings related to
hurricanes, largely due to the temporary suspension of
operations in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina;
(ii) the effects of higher landfill amortization costs,
generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to
align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with
the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting
their operations; (iii) higher landfill amortization
expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to
our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations; and
(iv) increases in salaries and wages.

Operating income in 2004 was favorably affected by
(i) positive internal revenue growth, largely due to volume
increases in higher margin landfill operations;
(ii) acquisitions; (iii) increased revenue during the
second half of 2004 as a result of the hurricanes in the region
during the third quarter; (iv) favorable landfill capping
adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2004, largely offset by
higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout 2004; and
(v) various operating and administrative cost reductions.
These improvements were partially offset by a charge to
“Asset impairments and unusual items” for the
write-off of a terminated landfill development project during
the fourth quarter of 2004.

Western

— The significant increase in income
from operations in 2005 can partially be attributed to internal
revenue growth, which was driven by yield improvements in
commercial and industrial collection operations and volume
growth in residential collection and transfer operations. In
addition, during 2005, we recognized $24 million of gains
associated with the divestiture of operations, an increase of
approximately $14 million from 2004. These earnings
improvements were partially offset by increased costs,
particularly for labor and related benefits.

The increase in operating income between 2003 and 2004 was
primarily attributable to revenue growth, which was largely due
to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection
and transfer operations and



average yield improvements in our commercial and residential
collection operations. These gains were partially offset by
(i) increased labor costs; (ii) higher fuel costs not
passed on to customers; and (iii) increases in third party
transportation and other subcontractor costs.

Wheelabrator

— The electric rates we charge to
our customers at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of
2005 as a result of higher market prices for natural gas, which
increased significantly as a result of hurricane-related
production disruptions, increased demand and increases in crude
oil prices. This increase in rates was the principal reason for
the current year increase in Wheelabrator’s income from
operations. The favorable impact of market prices for natural
gas was partially offset by higher costs of goods sold and
higher repair and maintenance costs due to the scope and timing
of work performed in 2005 as compared with 2004.

The increase in 2004 operating income was due in large part to
(i) positive internal revenue growth driven by improved
electricity pricing and average yield improvements on long-term
disposal contracts and (ii) the consolidation of two
special purpose variable interest entities on December 31,
2003, which increased income from operations as a result of
decreased operating costs, partially offset by increases in
depreciation expense (the impact of the consolidation of these
entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced
by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense).
Wheelabrator’s 2003 operating results were favorably
affected by an $11 million gain realized as a result of a
legal settlement, which also significantly affected their
trended income from operations for the years presented.

Recycling

— The decrease in income from
operations in our Recycling Group during 2005 when compared with
the prior year can generally be attributed to (i) an
increase in the rebates paid to our suppliers as a result of
increased competition; (ii) costs related to the deployment
of new software; and (iii) higher subcontractor costs
primarily related to increased distances traveled by third-party
truckers.

The comparability of operating results for the Recycling Group
for all of the periods presented above has been affected by
variances in the market prices for recyclable commodities.
During the three years ended December 31, 2005,
year-over-year changes in the quarterly average market prices of
OCC and ONP have ranged from a decrease of as much as 37% to an
increase of as much as 36%. In 2004, our operating revenues were
favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for
these commodities. Improvements in the market prices for
recycable commodities provide marginal increases to our income
from operations because a substantial portion of changes in
market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our
suppliers.

Other

— The increase in income from operations
from prior years is due to a pre-tax gain of $39 million
resulting from the divestiture of one of our landfills in
Ontario, Canada during the first quarter of 2005. This impact is
included in “Asset impairments and unusual items”
within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As this
landfill had been divested at the time of our 2005
reorganization, historical financial information associated with
its operations has not been allocated to our remaining
reportable segments. Accordingly, these impacts have been
included in Other. Partially offsetting this gain are certain
year-end adjustments related to the reportable segments that are
not included in the measure of segment income from operations
used to assess their performance for the periods disclosed.

Corporate

— The higher expenses in the current
year were driven primarily by impairment charges of
$68 million associated with capitalized software costs and
$31 million of net charges associated with various legal
and divestiture matters. These items are discussed in the

Asset Impairments and Unusual Items

section above. Also
contributing to the increase in expenses during 2005 were
(i) an increase in non-cash employee compensation costs
associated with current year changes in equity-based
compensation; (ii) increases in employee health care costs;
(iii) salary and wage increases attributable to annual
merit raises; (iv) increased sales and marketing costs
attributed to a national advertising campaign and consulting
fees related to our pricing initiatives; and (v) costs at
Corporate associated with our July 2005 restructuring charge and
organizational changes, which were partially offset by
associated savings at Corporate.

Higher professional fees contributed to the increase in 2004
expenses as compared with 2003.



Other Components of Income Before Cumulative Effect of
    Changes in Accounting Principles

    current year and prior year activity.

Interest Expense, net

Net interest expense increased by $80 million from 2004 to
2005 due to a $41 million increase in interest expense and
a $39 million decline in interest income. The increase in
interest expense in 2005 is generally related to a decline in
the benefit of our interest rate swaps. For all periods, we have
experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of
our interest rate derivative contracts, which we use to manage
our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The combined
benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements
resulted in net interest expense reductions of $39 million
for 2005, $90 million for 2004 and $96 million for
2003. The significant decline in the benefit recognized as a
result of our interest rate swap agreements in 2005 is largely
attributable to the increase in short-term market interest
rates. Our periodic interest obligations under our interest rate
swap agreements are based on a spread from the three-month
LIBOR, which has increased from 2.56% at December 31, 2004
to 4.54% at December 31, 2005.

Included in the $39 million in net reductions to interest
expense realized in 2005 for terminated and active interest rate
swap agreements is $42 million related to the amortization
of terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate swaps are
expected to reduce interest expense by $41 million in 2006,
$37 million in 2007 and $33 million in 2008.

The current year decrease in interest income is due primarily to
interest income of $46 million realized during 2004 on tax
refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several
federal audits. The comparability of net interest expense for
2004 and 2003 was also significantly affected by this increase
in interest income in 2004.

Equity in Losses (Earnings) of Unconsolidated
    Entities

In the first and second quarters of 2004, we acquired an equity
interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities.
Our equity interest in these facilities drives our equity in net
losses of unconsolidated entities. The year-over-year increase
in these losses is due to the timing of our initial investments
in 2004. These equity losses are more than offset by the tax
benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed
below within

Provision for Income Taxes

. If, for any
reason, the tax credits generated by the facilities were no
longer allowable under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue
Code, we could unwind the related investment in the period that
determination is made and not incur these equity losses in
future periods. Additional information related to these
investments is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Minority Interest

On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two special purpose
type variable interest entities as a result of our
implementation of FIN 46. Our minority interest expense for
2005 and 2004 is primarily related to the



other members’ equity interest in the earnings of these
entities. The increase in minority interest expense as a result
of the consolidation of these entities has been more than offset
by related increases in our consolidated income from operations.
The increase in minority interest expense in 2005 when compared
with 2004 was largely due to the improved operating results of
the surety bonding company that we began consolidating in 2003.
Additional information related to these investments is included
in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other, net

Our other income and expense is primarily attributable to the
impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian
operations.

Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded a benefit from income taxes of $90 million in
2005 compared to a provision for income taxes of
$247 million for 2004 and $404 million for 2003. For
both 2005 and 2004, the effective income tax rates of (8.2)% and
21.0%, respectively, are significantly less than the 2003
effective income tax rate of 36.0% partially due to the
resolution of significant tax audits within those years. The
settlement of tax audits resulted in a reduction in income tax
expense of $398 million in 2005, $101 million in 2004
and $6 million in 2003. Excluding the impact of tax audit
settlements, the effective tax rate for 2005 and 2004 would be
28.2% and 29.5%. For 2005 and 2004, the decrease in our adjusted
effective tax rate from 2003 is also attributable to our
investments in two coal-based synthetic fuel production
facilities that we obtained in the first half of 2004. The
decrease in our tax provision attributable to our equity
investments in these coal-based synthetic fuel production
facilities of $145 million in 2005 and $131 million in
2004 more than offset the related equity losses and interest
expense for those entities. These tax credits, as well as our
non-conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills,
are available through 2007 pursuant to Section 29 of the
Internal Revenue Code, but may be phased out if the price of oil
exceeds a threshold annual average price determined by the IRS.

For all periods, a portion of the difference in federal income
taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income
taxes is due to state and local income taxes. In 2005, we
reduced our estimated effective state tax rate, causing us to
realize a benefit of $16 million related to the reduction
of accumulated deferred taxes that was offset in part by
additional income tax expense of $4 million to increase the
accrued deferred tax as a result of a change in the provincial
tax rate in Quebec.

In 2005, our overall tax benefit has been partially offset by
the accrual of $34 million of taxes associated with our
repatriation of $496 million of accumulated earnings and
capital from certain of our Canadian subsidiaries under the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which is discussed further
within the

Liquidity and Capital Resources

section below.
See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion.

Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting
    Principles

On March 31, 2004, we recorded a credit of $8 million,
net of taxes, or $0.01 per diluted share, to
“Cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles” as a result of the consolidation of previously
unrecorded trusts as required by FIN 46. See Notes 2
and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

In the first and fourth quarters of 2003, we recorded net of tax
charges of $46 million and $43 million, respectively,
to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles” for the initial adoption of the accounting
changes described below.

•

Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major
    repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs
    associated with annual plant outages at our

waste-to

-energy
    facilities and independent power production plants. Effective
    January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to
    one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. We recorded
    $25 million, net of taxes, or $0.04 per diluted share,
    as a credit to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting
    principles.”



•

Through December 31, 2002, we accrued for future losses
    under customer contracts that we entered into that over the
    contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than
    revenues. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy
    from this method to one that expenses these costs as incurred.
    We recorded $30 million, net of taxes, or $0.05 per
    diluted share, as a credit to “Cumulative effect of changes
    in accounting principles.”

•

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, we
    recorded $101 million, including tax benefit, or
    $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a
    charge to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting
    principles.” Substantially all of this charge was related
    to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final
    capping, closure and post-closure costs.

•

In connection with the application of FIN 46 to special
    purpose type variable interest entities, we recorded
    $43 million, including tax benefit, or $0.07 per
    diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a charge to
    “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting
    principles.” For a discussion of these variable interest
    entities see Notes 2 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

As an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in
excess of its reinvestment needs, our primary source of
liquidity has been cash flows from operations. However, we
operate in a capital-intensive business and continued access to
various financing resources is vital to our continued financial
strength. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining
financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider
attractive. Based on several key factors we believe are
considered important by credit rating agencies and financial
markets in determining our access to attractive financing
alternatives, we expect to continue to maintain access to
capital sources in the future. These factors include:

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our
liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our
present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may
arise during the year as a result of changing business
conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working
capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
to and maintenance of our trucking fleet;
(iii) refurbishments and improvements at

waste-to

-energy and
materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and
equipment needs of our operations; and (v) capping, closure
and post-closure activities at our landfills. We are also
committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their
investment through our capital allocation program that provides
for up to $1.2 billion in aggregate dividend payments and
share repurchases each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. We also
continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be
accretive and provide continued growth in our core business.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the “Act”) became law. A provision of the Act allowed
U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign
subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005. Our Chief
Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic
reinvestment plan under which we repatriated $496 million
of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005. The
repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings.
For a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see
Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Summary of Cash, Short-Term Investments, Restricted Trust
    and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations

The following is a summary of our cash, short-term investments
available for use, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt
balances as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004
(in millions):

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash
equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates
of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade
commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three
months or less.

For discussion regarding the December 31, 2004
reclassification of cash, refer to Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the

Basis of
Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information

section above.

Short-term investments available for use

—
These investments include auction rate securities and variable
rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with long-term
scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The
interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a
periodic marketing of the underlying securities through an
auction process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest
rate reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment
in these securities, they have been classified as current assets
in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

—
Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds
held in trust for the construction of various facilities or
repayment of debt obligations, funds deposited in connection
with landfill closure, post-closure and remedial obligations and
insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily included
within “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional discussion.

We have used each of these facilities to support letters of
credit that we issue to support our insurance programs, certain
tax-exempt bond issuances, municipal and governmental waste
management contracts, closure and post-closure obligations and
disposal site or transfer station operating permits. These
facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our
obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the
letters of credit. We expect that similar facilities may
continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit
capacity in the future, and we continue to assess our financial
assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of
credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs.

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility
agreement. The agreement was entered into to facilitate
WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from
its Canadian subsidiaries as discussed above. The agreement,
which matures November 30, 2008, allowed Waste Management
of Canada Corporation to borrow up to Canadian $410 million
at any time on or before December 31, 2005. Any unused
portion of the available credit was subject to immediate
cancellation. As of December 31, 2005, the entire credit
capacity of the facility had been advanced resulting in proceeds
of U.S. $339 million. The advances do not accrue
interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we
received were for the principal amount of
U.S. $353 million net of the total interest obligation
due for the term of the advance. The advances have a weighted
average effective interest rate of 4.39% and mature either three
months or twelve months from the date of issuance. However, the
terms of the credit facility allow Waste Management of Canada
Corporation to elect to renew the advances. As of
December 31, 2005, we expect to repay
U.S. $86 million of outstanding advances with
available cash and renew the remaining borrowings under the
terms of the facility. Accordingly, $86 million of debt
associated with these borrowings is classified as current in our
December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet and the
remaining borrowings have been classified as long-term.

Senior notes

— As of December 31, 2005, we
had $5.2 billion of outstanding senior notes. The notes
have various maturities ranging from October 2006 to May 2032,
and interest rates ranging from 5.00% to 8.75%. On May 15,
2005, $100 million of 7.0% senior notes and
$3 million of 6.65% senior notes matured and were
repaid with cash on hand. We have $300 million of
7.0% senior notes that mature in October 2006 that we
currently expect to repay with available cash.



Tax-exempt bonds

— We actively issue tax-exempt
bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital
expenditures. As of December 31, 2005, we had
$2.3 billion of outstanding tax-exempt bonds. We issued
$246 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2005. The proceeds
from these debt issuances were deposited directly into a trust
fund and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the
money was raised, which is generally the construction of
collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment
necessary to provide waste management services. Accordingly, the
restricted funds provided by these financing activities have not
been included in “New borrowings” in our Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31,
2005. As we spend monies on the specific projects being
financed, we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds.
As discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts
section above, we have $185 million held in trust for
future spending as of December 31, 2005. During 2005, we
received $404 million from these funds for approved capital
expenditures.

As of December 31, 2005, $615 million of our
tax-exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to
effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent
is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can
put the bonds to us. These bonds are supported by letters of
credit that were issued primarily under our $2.4 billion,
five-year revolving credit facility that guarantee repayment of
the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us. Accordingly,
these obligations have been classified as long-term in our
December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Additionally, we have $333 million of fixed rate tax-exempt
bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which
is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offering of
the bonds is unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us,
requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by
letters of credit supported by our long-term facilities that
would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed
re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current obligation.
However, these bonds have been classified as long-term in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. The
classification of these obligations as long-term was based upon
our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long-term
financings in the event of a failed re-offering and our ability,
in the event other sources of long-term financing are not
available, to use our five-year revolving credit facility.

Tax-exempt project bonds

— As of
December 31, 2005, we had $404 million of outstanding
tax-exempt project bonds. These debt instruments are primarily
used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the development of

waste-to

-energy
facilities. The bonds generally require periodic principal
installment payments. As of December 31 2005,
$46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or
weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable
yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds,
then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. Repayment of
these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued
under our five-year revolving credit facility. Accordingly,
these obligations have been classified as long-term in our
December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Approximately
$51 million of our tax-exempt project bonds will be repaid
with available cash within the next twelve months.

Convertible subordinated notes

— We had
$35 million of convertible subordinated notes that we
repaid, with cash on hand, upon maturity on January 24,
2005.

Interest rate swaps

— We manage the interest
rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest
rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and
floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2005, the interest
payments on $2.4 billion of our fixed rate debt have been
swapped to variable rates, allowing us to maintain approximately
65% of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 35% at
variable interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting for
interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of
debt instruments by $47 million as of December 31,
2005 and $135 million at December 31, 2004.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

— We
generated $2,391 million in cash flows from our operating
activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared
with $2,218 million in 2004, an increase of
$173 million. In general, our current year operating cash
flow was favorably affected by growth in our operating income
and comparative changes in our trade and other receivables. As
of December 31, 2005, our trade receivables, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts, have increased $40 million
from December 31, 2004 compared with a $223 million
increase in trade receivables during 2004. The increase in our
receivables in both periods was primarily related to increased
revenues, however, the significant change year-over-year can
partially be attributed to 2004 receivable balances associated
with significant revenues generated from hurricane related
services provided in the second half of 2004. The relative
change in our receivables can also be attributed to overall
improvements in our collection efforts, which have contributed
to a reduction in our days sales outstanding.

Our 2005 and 2004 income taxes have been significantly affected
by tax audit settlements. The increases in our net income
associated with these tax benefits resulted in offsetting
reductions in our accrued liability balances. Therefore, the
significant variances in our income taxes during 2005, 2004 and
2003 have had an insignificant impact on each respective
period’s cash flows from operations.

Cash generated from operations during 2003 was negatively
affected by a $223 million net cash outflow for the
settlement of our securities class action lawsuit, which was
agreed to in 2001. This amount included: (i) a final net
cash settlement payment, net of insurance proceeds of
$377 million plus accrued interest; (ii) a total tax
benefit of approximately $138 million and
(iii) related net settlement recoveries of approximately
$16 million. This net cash outflow was partially offset by
$109 million of cash we received from counterparties for
terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their
scheduled maturities. After adjusting 2003 for the unusual items
mentioned above, our 2004 cash flows from operations increased
$178 million over 2003. Our improved earnings and the
favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel
partnerships were the primary contributors of this increase.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

— We used
$1,062 million of our cash resources for investing
activities during 2005, an increase of $180 million as
compared with 2004. This increase is primarily due to a
$266 million change in net cash flows associated with
purchases and sales of short-term investments. Net purchases of
short-term investments during 2005 were $295 million
compared with net purchases of $29 million during 2004. We
increased our utilization of short-term investments in the first
quarter of 2004, which resulted in this activity being
relatively insignificant in 2003. The increase in our short-term
investments available for use as of December 31, 2005 can
generally be attributed to an increase in our available cash,
which we plan to use to fund, among other things, a
$275 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that
became effective in January 2006 and our first quarter 2006
dividend that will be paid in March 2006. Our share repurchases
and dividends are discussed in our

Net Cash Used in Financing
Activities

section below.

The current year increase in net cash outflows from investing
activities as a result of our short-term investments was
partially offset by an increase in proceeds from divestitures of
businesses and other sales of assets, which were
$194 million in 2005, $96 million in 2004 and
$74 million in 2003. The $98 million increase from
2004 to 2005 is largely attributable to the sale of one of our
landfills in Ontario, Canada, as required by a Divestiture Order
from the Canadian Competition Tribunal. As we continue to focus
on our plan to divest of



certain under-performing and non-strategic operations, we expect
proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales to make even
greater contributions to our cash flows.

Our cash used for capital expenditures and acquisition spending
has also caused significant changes in our net cash used for
investing activities for the three-year period. Due to the
capital-intensive nature of our business, we have invested
between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in property and
equipment during each of the last three years. Capital
expenditures for 2005 were $1,180 million, which is
$78 million and $20 million less than we invested in
capital in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash used for
acquisitions was $142 million in 2005, $130 million in
2004 and $337 million in 2003. In recent years, our
business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuck-in
acquisitions, which are relatively small, accretive businesses
that will easily integrate with, and provide value to, our
existing operations. However, our 2003 acquisition activity was
uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large
acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller
tuck-in acquisitions, particularly in our recycling

line-of

-business. Our
current market development and capital allocation strategies
reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will
enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the
development or acquisition of disposal assets, which tend to
provide higher returns on investment and operating margins.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The
most significant changes in our financing cash flows during the
three years ended December 31, 2005 are related to
(i) variances in our net debt repayments, which can
generally be attributed to scheduled maturities;
(ii) increases in our dividend payments; and
(iii) changes in cash paid for our repurchases of common
stock. Cash paid for these financing activities are discussed
below.

Net debt repayments were $11 million in 2005,
$386 million in 2004 and $456 million in 2003. The
following summarizes our most significant cash borrowings and
debt repayments made during each year:

•


— We received $365 million for new
    borrowings during the year, primarily related to our Canadian
    Credit Facility that was entered into to facilitate WMI’s
    repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from its
    Canadian subsidiaries. The terms of these borrowings are
    discussed above. We also repaid $376 million of debt,
    including $103 million of senior notes, $46 million of
    tax-exempt project bonds, $35 million of convertible
    subordinated notes and $192 million associated with capital
    leases and other debt.

•


— We received proceeds of approximately
    $346 million from the March 2004 issuance of
    $350 million of 5.0% senior notes, repaid
    $150 million of 8.0% senior notes that matured in
    April 2004, $200 million of 6.5% senior notes that
    matured in May 2004 and $295 million of 7.0% senior
    notes that matured in October 2004. In addition, we borrowed
    $69 million, which was primarily for a short-term note that
    was repaid in 2005, and repaid $25 million of tax-exempt
    bonds and $42 million of tax-exempt project bonds and made
    $89 million of payments for capital leases and other debt.

•


— Our borrowings were primarily related to
    tax-exempt bonds and other debt. We repaid $435 million of
    6.375% senior notes that matured in December 2003,
    $43 million of tax-exempt project bonds and
    $85 million of capital lease obligations and other debt.

In August 2003, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly
dividend program, which began in the first quarter of 2004.
Under this program, we declared and paid a dividend of
$0.20 per share in each quarter of 2005 and of
$0.1875 per share in each quarter of 2004. The payment of
our quarterly dividends resulted in cash dividends of
$449 million in 2005 and $432 million in 2004. Before
this program was implemented, we paid an annual $0.01 per
share dividend, which resulted in a $6 million dividend
payment in 2003. In October 2005, the Board of Directors
announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments
will be $0.22 per share. On December 15, 2005, the
Board declared our first quarterly dividend for 2006 of
$0.22 per share, which will be paid on March 24, 2006
to stockholders of record as of March 6, 2006. All future
dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of
Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net
earnings, financial condition, cash required for future
prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant.

We paid $706 million for share repurchases in 2005 as
compared with $496 million paid during 2004 and
$550 million paid in 2003. Our 2005 stock repurchases and
dividend payments were made under a Board approved capital
allocation program providing for the authorization of up to
$1.2 billion for these activities



during each of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Since the inception of our
repurchase program in February 2002, we have repurchased
approximately 102 million shares of our common stock at a
net cost of approximately $2.7 billion. We currently expect
to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital
allocation program discussed above, and in January 2006
repurchased approximately 9 million shares for
$275 million under an accelerated share repurchase
agreement. Future share repurchases under this program will be
made at the discretion of management, and will depend on similar
factors to those considered by the Board in making dividend
declarations.

Summary of Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2005 and the anticipated effect of these
obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions):



We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely.
As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been
included in the above table. See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
these contingencies.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated
entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our third-party
guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our
financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These
arrangements have not materially affected our financial
position, results of operations or liquidity during the year
ended December 31, 2005 nor are they expected to have a
material impact on our future financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Seasonal Trends and Inflation

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer
months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
that tend to occur during the second half of the year can
actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However,
for several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such
revenue often generates comparatively lower margins. Certain
weather conditions may actually result in the temporary
suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
months, when electrical demand is generally lower, to perform
scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities.

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we
believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near
future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on
our results of operations. However, management’s estimates
associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have,
an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental
remediation liabilities.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Through December 31, 2005, we accounted for equity-based
compensation in accordance with APB No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

, as amended. Under APB
No. 25, companies were required to recognize compensation
expense based on the “intrinsic value” of the award at
the date of grant. For stock options, which were the primary
form of awards we granted through December 31, 2004, this
meant that we recognized no compensation expense in connection
with the grants, as the exercise price of the options was equal
to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004),

Share Based Payment

, which requires
companies to recognize compensation expense based on the
“fair value” of share based payments on the date of
grant. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1,
2006, which is discussed further in Note 23 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all
unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive plans,
effective December 28, 2005. The decision to accelerate the
vesting of outstanding stock options was made primarily to
reduce the non-cash compensation expense that we would have
otherwise recorded in future periods as a result of adopting
SFAS No. 123(R). We estimate that the acceleration
eliminated approximately $55 million of pre-tax
compensation charges that would have been recognized over the
next three years as the stock options continued to vest. We
recognized a $2 million pre-tax charge to compensation
expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the
acceleration, but will not be required to recognize future
compensation



expense for the accelerated options under
SFAS No. 123(R) unless further modifications are made
to the options, which is not anticipated.

Additionally, as a result of the changes in accounting under
SFAS No. 123(R) and a desire to design our long-term
incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to
operating and market performance, our Board of Directors
approved a substantial change in the form of awards that we
grant. Beginning in 2005, annual stock options grants, as well
as stock option grants in connection with new hires and
promotions, were replaced with either (i) grants of
restricted stock units and performance share units or
(ii) an enhanced cash incentive compensation award. The
restricted stock units granted in 2005 vest over four years and
the performance share units cliff vest based on the achievement
of certain performance targets after a three-year performance
period. Using APB No. 25, we generally have recognized
compensation expense for these awards over their respective
vesting periods. Compensation expense included in reported net
income associated with restricted stock (shares of which were
granted to a limited number of employees in each of the last
three years), restricted stock units and performance share units
was $17 million, or $11 million net of tax, for the
year ended December 31, 2005. The amount of compensation
expense recognized would not have been significantly different
had we accounted for them under the provisions of
SFAS No. 123(R).

As a result of our Board of Directors’ decision to
accelerate the vesting of outstanding options and replace stock
options with restricted stock units and performance share units,
we do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) to
significantly affect our accounting for equity-based
compensation since the resulting compensation expense for our
new share based payment awards is not significantly different
than under APB No. 25. However, we do expect compensation
expense to increase over the next three to four years because of
the incremental expense that will be recognized each year as our
Board of Directors grants additional awards.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market
    Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market
risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency
rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use
derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our
derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that
provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no
multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2005, all of
our derivative transactions were related to actual or
anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did
not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk
in the event of non-performance by our derivative
counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by
regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of
the counterparties, all of whom we either consider
credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support
their performance.

We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market
rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk
sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are
inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical
set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary
significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market
movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions
and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity
analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative
of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the
assumed market rate movements.

Interest Rate Exposure.

Our exposure to market risk for
changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt
obligations, which are primarily denominated in
U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to
manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations,
which directly impacts variability in interest costs. An
instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates
across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have
decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate
swap positions by approximately $480 million at
December 31, 2005 and $490 million at
December 31, 2004. This analysis does not reflect the
effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items,
such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would
have on interest expense and cash payments for interest.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have
$460 million and $647 million of assets held in trust
funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of
long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These
assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures
and closure, post-closure and remedial activities at our disposal



facilities and are, therefore, invested in high quality, liquid
instruments including money market accounts and
U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the
short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that
our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate
fluctuations is insignificant.

Currency Rate Exposure.

From time to time, we have used
currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency
translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency
denominated debt transactions. At December 31, 2005 and
2004 we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding.

Commodities Price Exposure.

We market recycled products
such as wastepaper, aluminum and glass from our material
recovery facilities. We enter into financial fiber swaps and
options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion
of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a floating
index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of
time. With regard to our option agreements, we have purchased
price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic
floors (put options) and price protection on certain wastepaper
purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options). Additionally,
we have entered into collars (combination of a put and call
option) with financial institutions in which we receive the
market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a
specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value
of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings,
as required. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk
management policy, which governs the type of instruments that
may be used. The fair value position of our commodity
derivatives would decrease by approximately $10 million at
December 31, 2005 and by approximately $20 million at
December 31, 2004 if there were an instantaneous 10%
increase across all commodities and applicable yield curves.

See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further discussion of the use of and accounting for
derivative instruments.

INDEX TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal
controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to
(i) the reliability of our financial reporting;
(ii) the reliability of the preparation and presentation of
the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States; and (iii) the safeguarding of assets from
unauthorized use or disposition.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005
based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Through this
evaluation, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our
internal controls. There are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
reporting; however, based on our evaluation, we have concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2005.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on
management’s assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Waste Management, Inc. at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, during 2003 and 2004 the Company adopted the
respective portions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” and, effective January 1, 2003, the
Company (i) changed its method of accounting for major
repairs and maintenance costs and annual outage costs,
(ii) changed its method of accounting for loss contracts
and (iii) adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Waste Management, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Waste Management, Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Waste
Management, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 and our report dated February 20,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
are the primary beneficiary (See Note 19). Waste
Management, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its
operations through subsidiaries. When the terms “the
Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”
are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste
Management, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated
variable interest entities. When we use the term
“WMI,” we are referring only to the parent holding
company.

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
North America. We provide collection, transfer, recycling and
disposal services. We are also a leading developer, operator and
owner of

waste-to

-energy
facilities in the United States. Our customers include
commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers,
other waste management companies, electric utilities and
governmental entities.

Accounting Changes and Reclassifications

Accounting Changes

FIN 46 — Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46”), which requires variable interest
entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries. A
primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the
entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of the
entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
entity. The impact of our implementation of FIN 46 is
summarized below.

Special purpose variable interest entities

— On
December 31, 2003, we began consolidating two limited
liability companies from which we lease three

waste-to

-energy
facilities. Prior to the consolidation of the entities, we
accounted for the underlying leases as operating leases and
accounted for our investment in the LLCs under the equity method
of accounting. Upon consolidating these entities, we recorded a
charge to “Cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles” of $43 million, net of tax benefit, or
$0.07 per diluted share.

Non-special purpose variable interest
entities

— On March 31, 2004, our application
of FIN 46 to non-special purpose type variable interest
entities resulted in the consolidation of certain trusts
established to support the performance of closure, post-closure
and environmental remediation activities. Upon consolidating
these entities, we recorded an increase in our net assets and a
credit of $8 million, net of taxes, or $0.01 per
diluted share, to “Cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles.”

See Note 19 for further discussion on these variable
interest entities.

Repairs and Maintenance

Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major
repairs and maintenance expenditures and we deferred costs
associated with annual plant outages at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities and independent power production plants. Effective
January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to
one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. In the first
quarter of 2003, we recorded $25 million, net of taxes, or
$0.04 per diluted share, as a credit to “Cumulative
effect of changes in accounting principles.” Our current
method of accounting is preferable because it (i) provides
operating results that more clearly reflect the timing and
amount of required expenditures, (ii) more clearly reflects
our assets and liabilities, and (iii) reduces the need to
make additional estimates and assumptions.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Loss Contracts

Through December 31, 2002, if our customer contracts were
projected to have direct costs greater than revenues over the
life of the contract, we accrued for those future losses.
Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this
method to one that expenses these losses as they are incurred.
In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded $30 million, net
of taxes, or $0.05 per diluted share, as a credit to
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Our
current method of accounting is preferable because it
(i) provides operating results that more clearly reflect
the timing and amount of any contract losses generated;
(ii) more clearly reflects our liabilities; and
(iii) reduces the need to make additional estimates and
assumptions.

Adoption of SFAS No. 143 — Accounting
    for Asset Retirement Obligations

In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded $101 million,
including tax benefit, or $0.17 per diluted share, as a
charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles
for the adoption of SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations

(“SFAS No. 143”). Substantially all of
this charge was related to changes in accounting for landfill
final capping, closure and post-closure costs. See further
discussion related to our accounting policies for these costs
under

Landfill Accounting

within Note 3.

Pro Forma Financial Information

Our changes in accounting for repairs and maintenance, loss
contracts and the adoption of SFAS No. 143 were
effective January 1, 2003. Accordingly, these accounting
changes do not affect the comparability of our results of
operations as presented in the accompanying Statements of
Operations.

If the accounting changes we implemented for special purpose
variable interest entities had been effective January 1,
2003, income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles would have been greater by $4 million, or
$0.01 per diluted share, for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The consolidation of the LLCs increased
our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles by $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share
for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The accounting changes we implemented for non-special purpose
variable interest entities have not significantly affected our
results of operations for the periods presented.

Reclassifications

The following reclassifications have been made to conform prior
year financial information with the current period presentation:

Cash balances

— During 2004, we began making
investments in auction rate securities and variable rate demand
notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled
maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. Through
December 31, 2004, we included these investments in
“Cash and cash equivalents.” As a result of guidance
issued in early 2005 associated with these types of securities,
we determined that these investments were more appropriately
classified as short-term investments, which are a component of
current “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Accordingly, in our accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements we have decreased our “Cash and cash
equivalents” and increased our current “Other
assets” by $19 million at December 31, 2004.

Gross purchases and sales of these investments are presented
within “Cash flows from investing activities” in our
Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, in our 2004 and 2003
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, relatively insignificant
purchases and sales of other short-term investments were
included on a net basis within “Cash flows from investing
activities — Other.” This additional activity is
now reflected within purchases and sales of short-term
investments in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Segments

— As discussed further in
Note 20, in the third quarter of 2005, we eliminated our
Canadian Group office, and the management of our Canadian
operations was allocated among our Eastern, Midwest and Western
Groups. We have allocated the operating results of our Canadian
operations to the Eastern, Midwest and Western Groups for 2003,
2004 and the first half of 2005 to provide financial information
that consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
operations. This reorganization also resulted in the
centralization of certain Group office functions. The
administrative costs associated with these functions were
included in the measurement of income from operations for our
reportable segments through August 2005, when the integration of
these functions with our existing centralized processes was
completed. Beginning in September 2005, these administrative
costs have been included in the income from operations of our
Corporate organization. The reallocation of these costs has not
significantly affected the operating results of our reportable
segments for the periods presented.

Certain other minor reclassifications have also been made to our
prior period consolidated financial information in order to
conform to the current year presentation.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of WMI, its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we
have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All
material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in entities in which we do not have a
controlling financial interest are accounted for under either
the equity method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.
These investments are regularly reviewed for impairment and
propriety of accounting treatment.

Estimates and assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
recognition of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity,
revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and
assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent
on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of
precision from data available or simply cannot be readily
calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some
cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine
and we must exercise significant judgment. The most difficult,
subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
with the greatest amount of uncertainty that we make in
preparing our financial statements relate to our accounting for
landfills, environmental liabilities and asset impairments, as
described below within

Landfill Accounting, Asset Impairments
and Contingent Liabilities.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit,
certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment
grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of
three months or less. For discussion regarding the
reclassification made to our December 31, 2004 balance to
conform to the current year’s presentation, refer to
Note 2.

Short-term investments available for use

We invest in auction rate securities and variable rate demand
notes, which are debt instruments with long-term scheduled
maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The interest
rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a periodic
marketing of the underlying securities through an auction
process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate
reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment in
these securities, they have been classified as current assets in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2005 and 2004, $300 million and
$19 million of investments in auction rate securities and
variable rate demand notes have been included as a component of
current “Other assets.”

Concentrations of credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, investments held within our
trust funds and escrow accounts, accounts receivable and
derivative instruments. We control our exposure to credit risk
associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets
and other financial interests with a diverse group of
credit-worthy financial institutions; (ii) holding high
quality financial instruments while limiting investments in any
one instrument; and (iii) maintaining strict policies over
credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit limits
and monitoring procedures, although generally we do not have
collateral requirements. In addition, our overall credit risk
associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large
number of geographically diverse customers we service. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, no single customer represented
greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.

Trade and other receivables

Our receivables are recorded when billed or advanced and
represent claims against third parties that will be settled in
cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the
allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net
realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful
accounts based on historical collection trends, type of
customer, such as municipal or non-municipal, the age of
outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions. If
events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific
receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is
given to the collectiblity of those balances and the allowance
is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are
written-off when our internal collection efforts have been
unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Also, we generally
recognize interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes
receivable as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes.

Landfill accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize
various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept
waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land
(including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer
property), permitting, excavation, liner material and
installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
capitalized interest, and

on-site

road
construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future
costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and
post-closure activities in accordance with
SFAS No. 143 and its Interpretations. These costs are
discussed below.

Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

—
Following is a description of these asset retirement activities
and our related accounting:

•

Final capping

— Involves the installation of
    flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage
    and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill
    where total airspace capacity has been consumed. Final capping
    asset retirement obligations are recorded on a

units-of

-consumption
    basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific final
    capping event with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Each final capping event is accounted for as a discrete
    obligation and recorded as an asset and a liability based on
    estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated
    with each final capping event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the
    final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required),
    demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs
    incurred after the site ceases



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to accept waste, but before the landfill is certified as closed
    by the applicable state regulatory agency. These costs are
    accrued as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is
    consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding
    increase in the landfill asset. Closure obligations are accrued
    over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the
    discounted cash flows associated with performing closure
    activities.

•

Post-closure

— Involves the maintenance and
    monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by
    the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to
    maintain and monitor landfill sites for a

30-year

period. These
    maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an asset
    retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of
    the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Post-closure obligations are accrued over the life of the
    landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows
    associated with performing post-closure activities.

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from
our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our
estimates are based on our interpretation of current
requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to
approximate fair value under the provisions of
SFAS No. 143. Absent quoted market prices, the
estimate of fair value should be based on the best available
information, including the results of present value techniques.
In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our
obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use
historical experience, professional engineering judgment and
quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the
fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize
these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract
with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those
instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the
incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component
of operating income when the work is performed.

Additionally, an estimate of fair value should also include the
price that marketplace participants are able to receive for
bearing the uncertainties inherent in these cash flows. However,
when using discounted cash flow techniques, reliable estimates
of market premiums may not be obtainable. In the waste industry,
there is generally not a market for selling the responsibility
for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations
independent of selling the landfill in its entirety.
Accordingly, we do not believe that it is possible to develop a
methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium. We have
excluded any such market risk premium from our determination of
expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations.

Once we have determined the final capping, closure and
post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time
of payment and discount those expected future costs back to
present value. During the year ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, we inflated these costs in current dollars until the
expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 2.5%. We
discount these costs to present value using the credit-adjusted,
risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred
consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in
expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated
cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the
current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the
historical weighted-average rate of the recorded obligation. As
a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to
calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to each
individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted-average
rate applicable to our asset retirement obligations at
December 31, 2005 is between 6.00% and 7.25%, the range of
the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rates effective since
adopting SFAS No. 143 in 2003.

We record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and
post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity
consumed through the current period. The fair value of final
capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the
airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the
expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of
closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our
estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire
landfill and the expected timing of each closure and
post-closure activity. Because these obligations are measured at
estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in
the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure
and post-closure



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

activities could result in a material change in these
liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We assess
the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our
recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts
change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or
extent of future final capping and closure and post-closure
activities typically result in both (i) a current
adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset; and
(ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded
prospectively over the remaining capacity of either the related
discrete final capping event or the landfill. Any changes
related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill
assets are then recognized in accordance with our amortization
policy, which would generally result in amortization expense
being recognized prospectively over the remaining capacity of
the final capping event or the landfill, as appropriate. Changes
in such estimates associated with airspace that has been fully
utilized result in an adjustment to the recorded liability and
landfill assets with an immediate corresponding adjustment to
landfill airspace amortization expense.

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the
timing and cost of future final capping, closure and
post-closure of fully utilized airspace resulted in a
$12 million and a $20 million net credit to landfill
airspace amortization expense, respectively, with the majority
of these credits resulting from revised estimates associated
with final capping changes. In managing our landfills, our
engineers look for ways to reduce or defer our construction
costs, including final capping costs. Most of the benefit
recognized in 2005 and 2004 was the result of concerted efforts
to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills allowing
us to delay spending for final capping activities, landfill
expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final capping
costs, or completed final capping construction that cost less
than anticipated. Such adjustments to final capping, closure and
post-closure were not significant in 2003.

Interest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure
liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and
is recorded as final capping, closure and post-closure expense,
which is included in “Operating” costs and expenses
within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The
amortizable basis of a landfill includes (i) amounts
previously expended and capitalized, net of the related
accumulated airspace amortization; (ii) capitalized
landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs, net of
the related accumulated airspace amortization;
(iii) projections of future purchase and development costs
required to develop the landfill site to its final capacity; and
(iv) projections of the cost to be incurred for landfill
final capping, closure and post-closure activities. Amortization
is recorded on a

units-of

-consumption
basis, applying cost as a rate per ton.

The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the
amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to
fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. For landfills that
we do not own, but operate through operating or lease
arrangements, the rate per ton is calculated based on the lesser
of the contractual term of the underlying agreement or the life
of the landfill. We account for each discrete final capping
event separately, which results in a per ton amortization rate
being calculated based on the estimated number of tons required
to fill the airspace associated with a single capping event. The
per ton amortization rate for all other components of the cost
basis of a landfill is determined using the estimated number of
tons necessary to fill the entire landfill’s available and
likely expansion airspace. These rates per ton are updated
annually, or more often if significant facts change.

We apply the following guidelines in determining a
landfill’s available and likely airspace:

•

Available Airspace

— Our engineers, in
    consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining available airspace at
    our landfills. The available airspace is determined by an annual
    survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill
    topography to the final landfill topography. Once the remaining
    airspace is determined, an airspace utilization factor
    (AUF) is established to calculate the remaining capacity in
    tons.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from
    previous annual surveys and then adjusted to account for
    settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will
    take into account several site-specific factors including
    current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected
    waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining,
    depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to moisture
    through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate. In
    addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a
    subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group. Our
    historical experience generally indicates that the impact of
    settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the
    landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its
    highest point under the permit requirements.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently
    unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in
    certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated
    with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial
    expansion permit application to be submitted within one year,
    and the final expansion permit to be received within five years.
    Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion
    permit is likely, considering the following criteria:

These criteria are initially evaluated by our field-based
    engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify
    potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our
    policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a
    specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of
    unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these
    circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a
    landfill-specific review process that includes approval of the
    Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of
    the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the
    65 landfill sites with expansions at December 31,
    2005, 16 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to
    approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Thirteen of
    these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer
    because legal, community or other issues could impede the
    expansion process. The remaining three landfills required
    approval primarily because the permit application processes
    would not meet the one or five year requirements, generally due
    to state-specific permitting procedures.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    available airspace, we also include the projected costs for
    development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs
    related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the
    expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be
significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
be significantly different than actual results, lower
profitability may



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final
capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses; or
higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most
significantly, if our belief that we will receive an expansion
permit changes adversely and it is determined that the expansion
capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the
recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to
recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the
likelihood of receiving the expansion permit has become remote,
the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are
expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation

— We are subject to
an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of
the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have
liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or
for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
a site. Such liabilities include potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) investigations, settlements, certain legal and
consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site
investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental
internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for
expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations
when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.
We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation
and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on
several estimates and assumptions.

Our estimations are based on several factors. We estimate costs
required to remediate sites where it is probable that a
liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and
circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that
require remediation, considering whether we were an owner,
operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and
type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were
associated with the site. Next, we review the same information
with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the
cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our
internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or
other service providers. Internally developed estimates are
based on:

There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the
costs associated with the likely remedy of a site. In these
cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our
best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a
better estimate than any other, we use the amounts that are the
low ends of such ranges in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

,
(“SFAS No. 5”) and its interpretations. If
we used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential
liability would be approximately $165 million higher on a
discounted basis than the $289 million recorded in the
Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2005.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation of a
particular site is inherently difficult and determining the
method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number
of assumptions be made. Our ultimate responsibility may differ
materially from current estimates. It is possible that
technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the
results of environmental studies, the inability to identify
other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the
settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require
us to record additional liabilities that could be material.
Additionally, our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities
could result in revisions that could cause upward or downward
adjustments to income from operations. These adjustments could
be material in any given period.

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular
environmental remediation liability and the timing of the
payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in
current dollars (2.5% at both December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004) until the expected time of payment and
discount the cost to present value using



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a risk-free discount rate, which is based on the rate for United
States treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted
average period until settlement of the underlying obligation
(4.25% at both December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004). We determine the risk-free discount rate and the
inflation rate on an annual basis unless interim changes would
significantly impact our results of operations. For remedial
liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest
accretion, based on the effective interest method, in operating
costs and expenses. The portion of our recorded environmental
remedial liabilities that has never been subject to inflation or
discounting as the amounts and timing of payments are not
readily determinable was $57 million and $63 million
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Had we not
discounted any portion of our environmental remedial liability,
the amount recorded would have been increased by
$36 million at December 31, 2005 and $40 million
at December 31, 2004.

Property and equipment (Exclusive of landfills discussed
    above)

Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost.
Expenditures for major additions and improvements are
capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred.

Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets using the straight-line method. We assume no
salvage value for our depreciable property and equipment. The
estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment
categories are as follows (in years):

We include capitalized costs associated with developing or
obtaining internal-use software within furniture, fixtures and
office equipment. These costs include external direct costs of
materials and services used in developing or obtaining the
software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees
directly associated with the software development project. As of
December 31, 2005, capitalized software costs, net of
accumulated depreciation, were $42 million.

When property and equipment are retired, sold or otherwise
disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
results of operations as increases or offsets to operating
expense for the period.

Leases

We lease property, plant and equipment in the ordinary course of
our business. Most of our lease agreements are for equipment
needed to support general and administrative functions. However,
our most significant lease obligations are for property and
equipment specific to our industry, including real property
operated as a landfill, transfer station or

waste-to

-energy
facility and equipment such as compactors. Our leases have
varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase options,
escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations
that we consider in determining minimum lease payments. The
leases are classified as either operating leases or capital
leases, as appropriate.

Operating leases

— The majority of our leases
are operating leases. This classification generally can be
attributed to either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease
payments as a result of real property lease



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligations that vary based on the volume of waste we receive or
process or (ii) minimum lease terms that are much shorter
than the assets’ economic useful lives. Management expects
that in the normal course of business our operating leases will
be renewed, replaced by other leases, or replaced with fixed
asset expenditures. Our rent expense during each of the last
three years and our future minimum operating lease payments, for
which we are contractually obligated as of December 31,
2005, are disclosed in Note 10.

Capital leases

— Assets under capital leases
are capitalized using interest rates appropriate at the
inception of each lease and are amortized over either the useful
life of the asset or the lease term on a straight-line basis.
The present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a
debt obligation. Our future minimum annual capital lease
payments are included in our total future debt obligations as
disclosed in Note 7.

Business combinations

We account for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination based on fair value estimates as of the
date of acquisition. These estimates are revised during the
allocation period as necessary if, and when, information
regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and
quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation
period generally does not exceed one year. To the extent
contingencies such as preacquisition environmental matters,
litigation and related legal fees are resolved or settled during
the allocation period, such items are included in the revised
allocation of the purchase price. After the allocation period,
the effect of changes in such contingencies is included in
results of operations in the periods in which the adjustments
are determined. We do not believe potential differences between
our fair value estimates and actual fair values are material.

In certain business combinations, we agree to pay additional
amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired
businesses of certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue
levels, targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for
expanded landfill airspace. Contingent payments, when incurred,
are recorded as purchase price adjustments or compensation
expense, as appropriate, based on the nature of each contingent
payment. Refer to the

Guarantees

section of Note 10
for additional information related to these contingent
obligations.

Held-for-sale assets

During our operations review processes, we, from time to time,
identify under-performing operations. We assess these operations
for opportunities to improve their performance. A possible
conclusion of this review may be that offering the related
assets for sale to others is in our best interests.
Additionally, we continually review our real estate portfolio
and identify any surplus property. We classify these assets as
held-for-sale when they meet the following criteria:
(i) management, having the authority to approve the action,
commits to a plan to sell the assets; (ii) the assets are
available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject
only to conditions that are usual and customary for the sale of
such assets; (iii) we are actively searching for a buyer;
(iv) the assets are being marketed at a price that is
reasonable in relation to their current fair value;
(v) actions necessary to complete the plan indicate that it
is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or
the plan will be withdrawn; and (vi) the sale is probable
and the transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a
completed sale within one year. These assets are recorded at the
lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less cost to
sell and are included within current “Other assets”
within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We continue to review
our classification of assets held-for-sale to ensure they meet
our held-for-sale criteria.

Discontinued operations

Quarterly, we analyze our operations that have been divested or
classified as held-for-sale in order to determine if they
qualify for discontinued operations accounting. Only operations
that qualify as a component



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of an entity (“Component”) under generally accepted
accounting principles can be included in discontinued
operations. We have concluded that routes and contracts do not
qualify as a Component, while a business unit or a market area
does qualify as a Component. Only Components where we do not
have significant continuing involvement with the divested
operations would qualify for discontinued operations accounting.
For our purposes, continuing involvement would include
continuing to receive waste at our landfill,

waste-to

-energy
facility or recycling facility from a divested hauling operation
or continuing to dispose of waste at a divested landfill. After
completing our analysis at December 31, 2005, we determined
that the operations that qualify for discontinued operations
accounting are not material to our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value
of the net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, we do not amortize goodwill. As discussed in the

Asset impairments

section below, we assess our goodwill
for impairment at least annually.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts,
customer lists, covenants

not-to

-compete,
licenses and permits (other than landfill permits, as all
landfill related intangible assets are combined with landfill
tangible assets and amortized using our landfill amortization
policy). Other intangible assets are recorded at cost and are
amortized using either a 150% declining balance approach or on a
straight-line basis as we determine appropriate. Customer
contracts and customer lists are generally amortized over seven
to ten years. Covenants

not-to

-compete are
amortized over the term of the non-compete covenant, which is
generally two to five years. Licenses, permits and other
contracts are amortized over the definitive terms of the related
agreements. If the underlying agreement does not contain
definitive terms and the useful life is determined to be
indefinite, the asset is not amortized.

Asset impairments

We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Typical indicators that
an asset may be impaired include:

If any of these or other indicators occur, the asset is reviewed
to determine whether there has been an impairment. An impairment
loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying amount
and fair value of the asset. If significant events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or
asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of
recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or
asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If
cash flows cannot be separately and



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

independently identified for a single asset, we will determine
whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for
which we can identify the projected cash flow. If the carrying
values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows,
we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the
asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is
determined by either an internally developed discounted
projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group or an
actual third-party valuation. If the fair value of an asset or
asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of
the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the
difference is recorded in the period that the impairment
indicator occurs and is included in the “Asset impairments
and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement
of Operations. Several impairment indicators are beyond our
control, and cannot be predicted with any certainty whether or
not they will occur. Estimating future cash flows requires
significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows
eventually realized. There are other considerations for
impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain of the indicators listed
above require significant judgment and understanding of the
waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
goodwill is impaired. Upon determining the existence of goodwill
impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by
which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting
the fair value of each of our reporting unit’s
(Group’s) identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair
value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting
unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being
initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be
performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes
in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would
indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill
has been impaired.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

As of December 31, 2005, our restricted trust and escrow
accounts consist principally of (i) funds deposited in
connection with landfill closure, post-closure and remedial
obligations; (ii) funds held in trust for the construction
of various facilities; and (iii) funds held in trust for
the repayment of our debt obligations. As of December 31,
2005 and 2004, we had $460 million and $647 million,
respectively, of restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are
generally included in long-term “Other assets” in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Closure, post-closure and remedial funds

— At
several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by
depositing cash into escrow accounts or trust funds that are
legally restricted for purposes of settling closure,
post-closure and remedial obligations. Balances maintained in
these trust funds and escrow accounts will fluctuate based on
(i) changes in statutory requirements; (ii) the
ongoing use of funds for qualifying closure, post-closure and
remedial activities; (iii) acquisitions or divestitures of
landfills; and (iv) changes in the fair value of the
financial instruments held in the trust fund or escrow account.

Tax-exempt bond funds

— We obtain funds from
the issuance of industrial revenue bonds for the construction of
collection and disposal facilities and for equipment necessary
to provide waste management services. Proceeds from these
arrangements are directly deposited into trust accounts, and we
do not have the ability to use the funds in regular operating
activities. Accordingly, these borrowings are excluded from
financing activities in our statement of cash flows. At the time
our construction and equipment expenditures have been documented
and approved by the applicable bond trustee, the funds are
released and we receive



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

cash. These amounts are reported in the statement of cash flows
as an investing activity when the cash is released from the
trust funds. Generally, the funds are fully expended within a
few years of the debt issuance. When the debt matures, we repay
our obligation with cash on hand and the debt repayments are
included as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.

Our trust fund assets funded by industrial revenue bonds and
held for future capital expenditures are invested in
U.S. government agency debt securities with maturities
ranging from less than one year to three years. For the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, our realized and
unrealized gains on these investments have not been material to
our results of operations and financial position.

Debt service funds

— Funds are held in trust to
meet future principal and interest payments required under
certain of our tax-exempt project bonds.

Derivative financial instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk
associated with fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices
and foreign currency exchange rates. We use interest rate swaps
to maintain a strategic portion of our debt obligations at
variable, market-driven interest rates. In prior periods, we
have entered into interest rate derivatives in anticipation of
our senior note issuances to effectively lock in a fixed
interest rate. We enter into commodity derivatives, including
swaps and options, to mitigate some of the risk associated with
our Recycling Group’s transactions, which can be
significantly affected by market prices for recyclable
commodities. Short-term foreign currency exchange rate
derivatives are often used to hedge our exposure to changes in
exchange rates for anticipated cash transactions between us and
our Canadian subsidiaries.

We obtain current valuations of our interest rate hedging
instruments from third party pricing models to account for the
fair value of outstanding interest rate derivatives. We estimate
the future prices of commodity fiber products based upon traded
exchange market prices and broker price quotations to derive the
current fair value of commodity derivatives. The fair value of
our foreign currency exchange rate derivatives is based on
quoted market prices. The estimated fair values of derivatives
used to hedge risks fluctuate over time and should be viewed in
relation to the underlying hedging transaction and the overall
management of our exposure to fluctuations in the underlying
risks. The fair value of derivatives is included in other
current assets, other long-term assets, accrued liabilities or
other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. Any ineffectiveness
present in either fair value or cash flow hedges is recognized
immediately in earnings without offset. There was no significant
ineffectiveness in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

•

Cash flow hedges

— The effective portion of
    those derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for accounting
    purposes is recorded in other comprehensive income within the
    equity section of our balance sheet. Upon termination, the
    associated balance in other comprehensive income is amortized to
    earnings as the hedged cash flows occur.

•

Fair value hedges

— The offsetting amounts for
    those derivatives designated as fair value hedges for accounting
    purposes are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of
    the hedged items. Upon termination, this carrying value
    adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of
    the hedged item.

As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the net fair value
and earnings impact of our commodity and foreign currency
derivatives were immaterial to our financial position and
results of operations. As further discussed in Note 7, our
use of interest rate derivatives to manage our fixed to floating
rate position has had a material impact on our operating cash
flows, carrying value of debt and interest expense during these
periods.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Self-insurance reserves and recoveries

We have retained a portion of the risks related to our
automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation
insurance programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and
associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses,
generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries
and by factoring in pending claims and historical trends and
data. The gross estimated liability associated with settling
unpaid claims is included in “Accrued liabilities” if
expected to be settled within one year, or otherwise is included
in long-term “Other liabilities.” Estimated insurance
recoveries related to recorded liabilities are reflected as
current “Other receivables” or long-term “Other
assets,” when we believe that the receipt of such amounts
is probable.

Foreign currency

We have significant operations in Canada. The functional
currency of our Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars. The
assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated
to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to
U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate during the
period. The resulting translation difference is reflected as a
component of other comprehensive income.

Revenue recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste
collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services and the
sale of recycled commodities, electricity and steam. The fees
charged for our services are generally defined in our service
agreements and vary based on contract specific terms such as
frequency of service, weight, volume and the general market
factors influencing a region’s rates. We generally
recognize revenue as services are performed or products are
delivered. For example, revenue typically is recognized as waste
is collected, tons are received at our landfills or transfer
stations, recycling commodities are delivered or as kilowatts
are delivered to a customer by a

waste-to

-energy
facility or independent power production plant.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services
include, among others, certain residential contracts that are
billed on a quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance
billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as
revenue in the period service is provided.

Capitalized interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development,
including landfill projects and likely landfill expansion
projects, and on certain assets under construction, including
internal-use software, operating landfills and

waste-to

-energy
facilities. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, total interest costs
were $505 million, $477 million and $461 million,
respectively, of which $9 million for 2005 and
$22 million for both 2004 and 2003, were capitalized,
primarily for landfill construction costs. The capitalization of
interest for operating landfills is based on the costs incurred
on discrete landfill cell construction projects that are
expected to exceed $500,000 and require over 60 days to
construct. In addition to the direct cost of the cell
construction project, the calculation of capitalized interest
includes an allocated portion of the common landfill site costs.
The common site costs include the development costs of a
landfill project or the purchase price of an operating landfill,
and the ongoing infrastructure costs benefiting the landfill
over its useful life. These costs are amortized to expense in a
manner consistent with other landfill site costs. The decline in
the amount of interest capitalized in 2005 as compared with
prior years results from fewer projects on which interest was
capitalized in the current year and an adjustment in the second
quarter of 2005 reducing amounts previously capitalized to a
large capital project.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Income taxes

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the
financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The
deferred income tax provision represents the change during the
reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards
and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant
judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of
deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when,
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged
and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change,
we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.

Accounting for stock options

Historically, we have accounted for our stock-based
compensation, as discussed in detail in Note 15, using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, as amended.
Pursuant to APB Opinion No. 25, we generally have not
recognized compensation cost for our stock options because the
number of shares potentially issuable and the exercise price,
which is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, are fixed. Refer to Note 23 for
discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized a charge to
compensation expense of $2 million for the accelerated
vesting of all unvested stock options effective
December 28, 2005. We estimate that the acceleration
eliminated approximately $55 million in compensation
expense, or $34 million net of tax, that would have been
recognized under the provisions of SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004),

Share Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”), over the next three
years as the stock options vested. For additional information
related to this modification of outstanding awards, refer to
Note 15. The following schedule reflects the pro forma
impact on net income and earnings per common share of accounting
for our stock option grants using SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, which includes a
pro forma charge of $41 million, net of tax, for the
accelerated vesting of our outstanding stock options (in
millions, except per share amounts):



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of our stock option grants in the table above was
estimated utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
following weighted average assumptions were used: dividend yield
from zero to 2.95%; risk-free interest rates, which vary for
each grant, ranging from 1.34% to 4.24%; expected life of six
years for all grants; and stock price volatility ranging from
22.75% to 34.02%. Black-Scholes is a formula that calculates an
estimated value of stock options based on appreciation and
interest rate assumptions. Therefore, the fair value calculation
of a stock option using Black-Scholes is not necessarily
indicative of the actual value of a stock option.

As a result of both the changes in accounting for share-based
payments and a desire to design our long-term incentive plans in
a manner that creates a stronger link to operating and market
performance, in 2004, our Board of Directors approved a
substantial change in the form of equity-based awards that we
grant. In prior years, stock option awards were the primary form
of equity-based compensation. Beginning in 2005, we replaced
this form of compensation with restricted stock units and
performance share units. We do not intend to include stock
options as a component of our future long-term incentive plans.
Additional information regarding the significant terms of our
restricted stock units and performance share units, 2005 grants
and the related compensation expense is included in Note 15.

Contingent liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with
respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
SFAS No. 5. We are party to pending or threatened
legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters in various
jurisdictions. It is not always possible to predict the outcome
of litigation, as it is subject to many uncertainties.
Additionally, it is not always possible for management to make a
meaningful estimate of the potential loss or range of loss
associated with such litigation.

Supplemental cash flow information

Non-cash investing and financing activities are excluded from
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, non-cash activities
included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal
payments made directly from trust funds, of $201 million,
$283 million and $456 million, respectively. We also
have increases in our debt obligations as a result of
acquisitions and non-cash borrowings. In 2004, the primary
component of our non-cash financings was the issuance of
$118.5 million of debt in return for our equity investment
in two synthetic fuel production facilities. These investments
are discussed in detail in Note 8. This activity was not
significant for the years ended December 31, 2005 or 2003.

On December 15, 2005, we declared our first quarterly cash
dividend for 2006. The dividend is $0.22 per common share
and is payable March 24, 2006 to stockholders of record on
March 6, 2006. As of December 31, 2005,
$122 million has been accrued for this dividend
declaration. As the dividend payment does not occur until March
2006, it has been excluded from our “Net cash used in
financing activities” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Revolving credit and letter of credit
facilities

— We have a $2.4 billion
syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in October
2009, a $350 million letter of credit facility that matures
in December 2008 and $295 million of letter of credit and
term loan agreements maturing at various points through June
2013. These credit facilities generally have been used to issue
letters of credit to support our bonding and financial assurance
needs. Our letters of credit generally have terms providing for
automatic renewal after one year. In the event of an
unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit, the amount of the draw
paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts into a
term loan for the remaining term of the respective agreement or
facility. Through December 31, 2005, we had not experienced
any unreimbursed draws on letters of credit.

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility
agreement. The agreement was entered into to facilitate
WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from
its Canadian subsidiaries (See Note 8). The agreement,
which matures November 30, 2008, allowed Waste Management
of Canada Corporation to borrow up to Canadian $410 million
at any time on or before December 31, 2005. Any unused
portion of the available credit was subject to immediate
cancellation. As of December 31, 2005, the entire credit
capacity of the facility had been advanced resulting in proceeds
of U.S. $339 million. The advances do not accrue
interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we
received were for the principal amount of
U.S. $353 million net of the total interest obligation
due for the term of the advance. The difference between the
principal borrowed and proceeds received is being amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method with a
corresponding increase in our recorded debt obligation. During
December 2005, we increased the carrying value of the debt for
the recognition of $1 million of interest expense for the
facility. The advances have a weighted average effective
interest rate of 4.39% and mature either three months or twelve
months from the date of issuance. However, the terms of the
credit facility allow Waste Management of Canada Corporation to
elect to renew the advances. As of December 31, 2005, we
expect to repay U.S. $86 million of outstanding
advances with available cash and renew the remaining borrowings
under the terms of the facility. Accordingly, $86 million
of debt associated with these borrowings is classified as
current in our December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet
and the remaining borrowings have been classified as long-term.

— On May 15, 2005,
$100 million of 7.00% senior notes and $3 million
of 6.65% senior notes matured and were repaid with cash on
hand. During March 2004, we issued $350 million of
5.0% senior notes due March 15, 2014. Interest on the
notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The
net proceeds of the offering were $346 million after
deducting underwriters’ discounts and expenses. These
proceeds were used to repay $150 million of
8.0% senior notes due April 30, 2004 and
$200 million of 6.5% senior notes due May 15,
2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we paid, with cash on hand,
$295 million of 7.0% senior notes due October 1,
2004. We have $300 million of 7.0% senior notes that
mature in October 2006 that we currently expect to repay with
available cash. Accordingly, this obligation has been reflected
as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2005.

Tax-exempt bonds

— We actively issue tax-exempt
bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing. We issued
$246 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2005 and
$345 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2004,
$35 million of which was issued to refinance higher rate
tax-exempt debt. The proceeds from these debt issuances may only
be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised,
which is generally to finance expenditures for landfill
construction and development, equipment, vehicles and facilities
in support of our operations. Proceeds from bond issues are held
in trust until such time as we incur qualified expenditures, at
which time we are reimbursed from the trust funds. We issue both
fixed and floating rate obligations. Interest rates on floating
rate bonds are re-set on a weekly basis and the underlying bonds
are supported by letters of credit.

Tax-exempt project bonds

— Tax-exempt project
bonds have been used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the
development of

waste-to

-energy
facilities. These facilities are integral to the local
communities they serve, and, as such, are supported by long-term
contracts with multiple municipalities. The bonds generally have
periodic amortizations that are supported by the cash flow of
each specific facility being financed. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, we repaid $91 million of these
bonds with either available cash or debt service funds.

Convertible subordinated notes

— Approximately
$35 million of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes
were repaid, with cash on hand, upon maturity at
January 24, 2005.

Scheduled debt payments

— The schedule of
anticipated debt and capital lease payments (including the
current portion) for the next five years is presented below (in
millions). Our recorded debt and capital lease obligations
include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums
and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities.
These amounts have been excluded here because they will not
result in cash payments.

(a)

Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2005 include
    $333 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds subject to
    re-pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to
    their scheduled maturities. If the re-offering of the bonds is
    unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring
    immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of
    credit supported by our long-term facilities that would serve to
    guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re-offering and
    are, therefore, considered a current obligation. However, these
    bonds have been classified as long-term in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. The classification
    of these obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to
    refinance the borrowings with other long-term financings in the
    event of a failed re-offering and our ability, in the event
    other sources of long-term financing are not available, to use
    our five-year revolving credit facility.

(b)

At December 31, 2005, we have $615 million of
    tax-exempt bonds and $46 million of tax-exempt project
    bonds that are remarketed either daily or weekly by a
    remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If
    the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the
    remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds are
    supported by letters of credit guaranteeing repayment of the
    bonds in this event. We classified these borrowings as long-term
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005
    because the borrowings are supported by letters of credit
    primarily issued under our five-year revolving credit facility,
    which is long-term.

(c)

We have classified approximately $290 million of our debt
    obligations with contractual maturities on or before
    December 31, 2006 as long-term in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet at December 31, 2005 because we have the intent and
    ability to refinance these obligations with long-term debt
    instruments.

Secured debt

— Our debt balances are generally
unsecured, except for $313 million of the tax-exempt
project bonds outstanding at December 31, 2005 that were
issued by certain subsidiaries within our Wheelabrator Group.
These bonds are secured by the related subsidiaries’ assets
that have a carrying value of $466 million and the related
subsidiaries’ future revenue. Additionally, our
consolidated variable interest entities have $86 million of
outstanding borrowings that are collateralized by certain of
their assets. These assets have a carrying value of
$377 million as of December 31, 2005. See Note 19
for further discussion.

Debt Covenants

Our revolving credit facility and certain other financing
agreements contain financial covenants. The most restrictive of
these financial covenants are contained in our revolving credit
facility. The following table summarizes the requirements of
these financial covenants and the results of the calculation, as
defined by the revolving credit facility:

Our revolving credit facility and senior notes also contain
certain restrictions intended to monitor our level of
indebtedness, types of investments and net worth. We monitor our
compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they
significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or
financing arrangements typical for our business. As of
December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants
and restrictions under all of our debt agreements.

Interest rate swaps

We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio
principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a
desired position of fixed and floating rate debt, which was
approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating at December 31,
2005. We do not use interest rate derivatives for trading or
speculative purposes. Our significant interest rate swap
agreements that were outstanding as of December 31, 2005
and 2004 are set forth in the table below (dollars in millions):

These interest rate derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
    Therefore, the fair value of each interest rate derivative is
    included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either a
    component of long-term “Other assets” or long-term
    “Other liabilities,” and fair value adjustments to the
    underlying debt are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to
    interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged
    instrument.

The fair value for these interest rate derivatives is comprised
    of $2 million of long-term assets and $133 million of
    long-term liabilities.

The fair value for these interest rate derivatives is comprised
    of $7 million of long-term assets and $91 million of

$135 million as of December 31, 2004. The following

    interest expense over the next twelve months. Approximately
    $42 million (on a pre-tax basis) of the December 31,
    2004 balance was reclassified into earnings during 2005.

Interest rate swap agreements reduced net interest expense by
$39 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
$90 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
$96 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
significant terms of the interest rate contracts and the
underlying debt instruments are identical and therefore no
ineffectiveness has been realized.

Interest rate locks

We have entered into cash flow hedges to secure underlying
interest rates in anticipation of senior note issuances. These
hedging agreements resulted in a deferred loss, net of taxes, of
$32 million at December 31, 2005 and $35 million
at December 31, 2004, which is included in accumulated
other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2005,
$6 million (on a pre-tax basis) is scheduled to be
reclassified into interest expense over the next twelve months.

Provision for income taxes

The provision for taxes on income before cumulative effect of
changes in accounting principles consisted of the following (in
millions):

The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to
the effective rate as follows:

Non-conventional fuel tax credits

— The
favorable impact of non-conventional fuel tax credits has been
derived from our landfills and our investments in two
coal-based, synthetic fuel production facilities (the
“Facilities”), which are discussed in more detail
below. The fuel generated from our landfills and the Facilities
qualifies for tax credits through 2007 pursuant to
Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, but may be phased
out if the price of oil exceeds an annual average price
threshold determined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

The tax credits generated by our landfills are provided by our
Renewable Energy Program, under which we develop, operate and
promote the beneficial use of landfill gas. Our recorded taxes
include benefits of $34 million, $32 million and
$28 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, from tax credits generated by our
landfill

gas-to

-energy
projects.

In the first and second quarters of 2004, we acquired minority
ownership interests in the Facilities, which result in the
recognition of our pro-rata share of the Facilities’
losses, the amortization of our initial

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

investments and additional expense associated with other
estimated obligations being recorded as “Equity in net
losses of unconsolidated entities” within our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the
impact of our investments in the Facilities on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31,

The benefit from income taxes attributable to the Facilities
    includes tax credits of $99 million and $88 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

The equity losses and associated tax benefits would not have
been incurred if we had not acquired the minority ownership
interest in the Facilities. In addition, if the tax credits
generated by the Facilities were no longer allowable under
Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, we could unwind
the investment in the period that determination is made and not
incur these losses in future periods.

Tax audit settlements

— At December 31,
2003, we were either within the examination or appeals phase of
IRS audits for the years 1989 to 2001. Since then, the audits
for these periods have been completed, which have resulted in
net tax benefits upon resolution. The settlement of tax audits
during 2005 resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of
$398 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. During 2004,
we realized $101 million in tax benefits, or $0.17 per
diluted share, related to audit settlements as well as realized
$46 million in interest income as a result of these
settlements. In 2003, the settlement of tax audits resulted in a
$6 million tax benefit, or $0.01 per diluted share.
The reduction in income taxes recognized is primarily
attributable to the associated reduction in our accrued tax and
related accrued interest liabilities. For information regarding
the status of current activity, refer to Note 10.

Repatriation of earnings in foreign
subsidiaries

— On October 22, 2004, the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) became
law. A provision of the Act allowed U.S. companies to
repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced
tax rate during 2005. We decided to repatriate net accumulated
earnings and capital from certain of our Canadian subsidiaries
in accordance with this provision, which were previously
accounted for as permanently reinvested in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for Income Taxes —
Special Areas

. During 2005, our Chief Executive Officer and
Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan under
which we repatriated $496 million of our accumulated
foreign earnings and capital through cash on hand as well as
debt borrowings. Refer to Note 7 for discussion on the
related debt issuance. During 2005, we accrued $34 million
in tax expense for these repatriations. The repatriation of
earnings from our Canadian subsidiaries increased our 2005
effective tax rate by approximately 3.1%, which has been
reflected as a component of the “Tax rate differential on
foreign income” line item of the effective tax rate
reconciliation provided above.

At December 31, 2005, remaining unremitted earnings in
foreign operations was approximately $230 million, which is
considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision for
income taxes has been accrued for these unremitted earnings.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred tax assets (liabilities)

The components of the net deferred tax assets
(liabilities) at December 31 are as follows (in
millions):

At December 31, 2005 we had $29 million of federal net
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards,
$4.1 billion of state NOL carryforwards, and
$79 million of Canadian NOL carryforwards. The federal and
state NOL carryforwards have expiration dates through the year
2025. The Canadian NOL carryforwards have the following expiry:
$26 million in 2006, $27 million in 2007,
$24 million in 2009, $1 million in 2010 and
$1 million in 2011. We have $39 million of alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards that may be used indefinitely
and state tax credit carryforwards of $13 million.

We have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in
realizing the benefit of tax loss and credit carryforwards and
other deferred tax assets. While we expect to realize the
deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances, changes in
estimates of future taxable income or in tax laws may alter this
expectation. The valuation allowance increased $1 million
in 2005 primarily due to the uncertainty of realizing federal
and state NOL carryforwards and tax credits.

Employee Benefit Plans

Our Waste Management Retirement Savings Plan (“Savings
Plan”) covers employees (except those working subject to
collective bargaining agreements, which do not provide for
coverage under such plans) following a

90-day

waiting period
after hire. Through December 31, 2004 eligible employees
were allowed to contribute up to 15% of their annual
compensation. Effective January 1, 2005, eligible employees
may contribute as much as 25% of their pay under the Savings
Plan. All employee contributions are subject to annual
contribution limitations established by the IRS. Under the
Savings Plan, we match, in cash, 100% of employee contributions
on the first 3% of their eligible compensation and match 50% of
employee contributions on the next 3% of their eligible
compensation, resulting in a maximum match of 4.5%. Both
employee and company contributions vest immediately. Charges to
operations for our defined contribution plans were
$48 million in 2005, $46 million in 2004 and
$43 million in 2003.

Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”)
and certain of its subsidiaries provided post-retirement health
care and other benefits to eligible employees. In conjunction
with our acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998, we
limited participation in these plans to participating retired
employees as of December 31, 1998. The benefit obligation
for these plans was $58 million and $62 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The discount rate
assumptions used in the measurement of our benefit obligations
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 5.5%. The accrued
benefit liability as of December 31, 2005 and 2004



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

was $60 million and $62 million, respectively, which
is reflected in “Accrued liabilities” in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Participants in the WM Holdings post-retirement plan
contribute to the cost of the benefit. For measurement purposes,
a 12% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
health care claims was assumed for 2005 (being an average of the
rate used by all plans); the rate was assumed to gradually
decrease to 5.5% in 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.

A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates has no
significant effect on total service and interest cost components
of net periodic post-retirement health care costs. A 1% increase
or decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would
increase or decrease the accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligation by approximately $5 million.

Certain of our subsidiaries participate in various
multi-employer employee benefit and pension plans covering union
employees not covered under other pension plans. These
multi-employer plans are generally defined contribution plans.
Specific benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not
negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.
Additionally, we have one instance of a site-specific plan for
employees not covered under other plans. The projected benefit
obligation, plan assets and unfunded liability of the
multi-employer pension plans and the site specific plan are not
material. Contributions of $40 million in 2005,
$35 million in 2004 and $31 million in 2003 were
charged to operations for those subsidiaries’ defined
benefit and contribution plans.

10.

Commitments and Contingencies

Financial instruments

— We have obtained
letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies, and
have established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to
support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill
closure and post-closure requirements, environmental
remediation, and other obligations.

Historically, our revolving credit facilities have been used to
obtain letters of credit to support our bonding and financial
assurance needs. We also have letter of credit and term loan
agreements and a letter of credit facility that were established
to provide us with additional sources of capacity from which we
may obtain letters of credit. These facilities and agreements
are discussed further in Note 7. We obtain surety bonds and
insurance policies from an affiliated entity that we have an
investment in and account for under the cost method.
Additionally in 2003, we guaranteed the debt of a newly-formed
surety company in order to assist in the establishment of that
entity. The terms of this guarantee are further discussed within
the

Guarantees

section of this note. This variable
interest entity is consolidated as described in Note 19. We
also obtain insurance from a wholly-owned insurance company, the
sole business of which is to issue policies for the parent
holding company and its other subsidiaries, to secure such
performance obligations. In those instances where our use of
captive insurance is not allowed, we generally have available
alternative bonding mechanisms.

Because virtually no claims have been made against the financial
instruments we use to support our obligations and considering
our current financial position, management does not expect that
any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty
in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for
our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks
of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity,
we continue to evaluate various options to access cost-effective
sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance coverage for
protection of our assets and operations from certain risks
including automobile liability, general liability, real and
personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’
and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and
other coverages we believe are customary to the industry.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited
to the per incident deductible under the related insurance
policy. Our exposure, however, could increase if our insurers
were unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a portion of the risks related to our
automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation
insurance programs. For our self-insured retentions, the
exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including
incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial
valuation and internal estimates. The estimated accruals for
these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences or
loss development significantly differ from utilized assumptions.
As of December 31, 2005, our insurance programs carried
self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million,
$1 million and $20,000 per incident with regards to
general liability, workers’ compensation and auto,
respectively. Effective January 1, 2006, we increased the
per incident deductible for our auto insurance programs to
$1 million. Self-insurance claims reserves acquired as part
of our acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998 were
discounted at 4.25% at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The
changes to our net insurance liabilities for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2005 are summarized below (in
millions):

For the 14 months ended January 1, 2000, we insured
certain risks, including auto, general liability and
workers’ compensation, with Reliance National Insurance
Company, whose parent filed for bankruptcy in June 2001. In
October 2001, the parent and certain of its subsidiaries,
including Reliance National Insurance Company, were placed in
liquidation. We believe that because of various state insurance
guarantee funds and probable recoveries from the liquidation,
currently estimated to be $19 million, it is unlikely that
events relating to Reliance will have a material adverse impact
on our financial statements.

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property,
environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating leases

— Rental expense for leased
properties was $129 million, $127 million and
$174 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
These amounts primarily include rents under long-term operating
leases. Contractual payments due during the next five years and
thereafter on long-term operating lease obligations are noted
below. The decrease in rental expense for 2005 and 2004 as
compared with 2003 is primarily attributable to the
consolidation of two limited liability companies from which we
lease three

waste-to

-energy
facilities as of December 31, 2003. See Note 2 for
discussion.

Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during
future periods is significantly less than current year rent
expense because our significant lease agreements at landfills
have variable terms based either

on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received.
Our minimum operating lease payments for the next five years are
as follows (in millions):

Other long-term commitments

— We have the
following unconditional obligations:

Our unconditional obligations are established in the ordinary
course of our business and are structured in a manner that
provides us with access to important resources at competitive,
market-driven rates. Our actual future obligations under these
outstanding agreements are generally quantity driven, and, as a
result, our associated financial obligations are not fixed as of
December 31, 2005. We currently expect the products and
services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the
needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect
these established arrangements to materially impact our future
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In addition to the unconditional obligations discussed above, we
are party to contracts that require us to purchase an
established percentage of our annual expenditures for equipment
used in our collection operations and certain materials used for
landfill construction and final capping activities from specific
vendors. These agreements do not establish minimum purchase
obligations, and expire in 2006.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following
guarantee agreements associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2005, WM Holdings, one of
    WMI’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior
    indebtedness, which matures through 2032. WMI has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of the senior indebtedness of
    WM Holdings, which matures



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

WMI and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial
    and general operating obligations of certain of their
    subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual
    obligations as they come due, the guarantor has an unconditional
    obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has
    been recorded for service, financial or general operating
    guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are
    properly accounted for as costs of operations as services are
    provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No
    additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees
    because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly
    accounted for as operating or capital leases, as appropriate.

We currently believe that it is not reasonably likely that we
will be required to perform under these guarantee agreements or
that any performance requirement would have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

Environmental matters

— Our business is
intrinsically connected with the protection of the environment.
As such, a significant portion of our operating costs and
capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of
environmental protection. Such costs may increase in the future
as a result of legislation or regulation. However, we believe
that we generally tend to benefit when environmental regulation
increases, because such regulations increase the demand for our
services, and we have the resources and experience to manage
environmental risk.

Estimates of the extent of our degree of responsibility for
remediation of a particular site and the method and ultimate
cost of remediation require a number of assumptions and are
inherently difficult, and the ultimate outcome may differ
materially from current estimates. However, we believe that our
extensive experience in the environmental services industry, as
well as our involvement with a large number of sites, provides a
reasonable basis for estimating our aggregate liability. As
additional information becomes available, estimates are adjusted
as necessary. It is reasonably possible that technological,
regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of
environmental studies, the nonexistence or inability of other
PRPs to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities, or
other factors could necessitate the recording of additional
liabilities which could be material.

As of December 31, 2005, we had been notified that we are a
PRP in connection with 72 locations listed on the EPA’s
National Priorities List (“NPL”). Of the 72 sites at
which claims have been made against us, 16 are sites we own.
Each of the NPL sites we own was initially developed by others
as land disposal facilities. At each of these facilities, we are
working in conjunction with the government to characterize or
remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed
with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing
the costs of remediation or are pursuing resolution of an
allocation formula. We generally expect to receive any amounts
due from these parties at, or near, the time that we make the
remedial expenditures. The 56 NPL sites at which claims have
been made against us and that we do not own are at different
procedural stages under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
which is known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of these proceedings involve allegations that
certain of our subsidiaries (or their predecessors) transported
hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our
acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for
liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to
or disposing at the sites. Proceedings arising under Superfund
typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste
transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or
recover costs associated with site investigation and cleanup,
which costs could be substantial and could have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. At some
of the sites at which we’ve been identified as a PRP, our
liability is well defined as a consequence of a governmental
decision and an agreement among liable parties as to the share
each will pay for implementing that remedy. At other sites,
where no remedy has been selected or the liable parties have
been unable to agree on an appropriate allocation, our future
costs are uncertain. Any of these matters potentially could have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

Litigation

— In December 1999, an individual
brought an action against the Company, five former officers of
WM Holdings, and WM Holdings’ former independent
auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, in Illinois state court on behalf
of a proposed class of individuals who purchased
WM Holdings common stock before November 3, 1994, and
who held that stock through February 24, 1998. The action
is for alleged acts of common law fraud, negligence and breach
of fiduciary duty. This case has remained in the pleadings stage
for the last several years due to numerous motions and rulings
by the court related to the viability of these claims. The
defendants removed the case to federal court in Illinois, but a
remand order has been issued. An appeal of that remand has been
filed by the Company. Only limited discovery has occurred and
the defendants continue to defend themselves vigorously. The
extent of possible damages, if any, in this action cannot yet be
determined.

In April 2002, a former participant in WM Holdings’
ERISA plans and another individual filed a lawsuit in
Washington, D.C. against WMI, WM Holdings and others,
attempting to increase the recovery of a class of ERISA plan
participants based on allegations related to both the events
alleged in, and the settlements relating to, the securities
class action against WM Holdings that was settled in 1998
and the securities class action against us that was settled in
November 2001. Subsequently, the issues related to the latter
class action have been dropped as to WMI, its officers and
directors. The case is ongoing with respect to WM Holdings
and others, and WM Holdings intends to defend itself
vigorously.

Two separate lawsuits currently pending in Texas state court
against WMI and certain former officers of WMI allege that the
plaintiffs are substantial holders of the Company’s common
stock who intended to sell their stock in 1999, or to otherwise
protect themselves against loss, but that the public statements
we made regarding our prospects, and in some instances
statements made by the individual defendants, were false and
misleading and induced the plaintiffs to retain their stock or
not to take other protective measures. The plaintiffs assert
that the value of their retained stock declined dramatically and
that they incurred significant losses. The plaintiffs assert
claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and conspiracy.
The first of these cases was dismissed by summary judgment by a
Texas state court in March 2002. That dismissal was ultimately
upheld by the appellate court and the plaintiffs have appealed
this decision to the highest state court in Texas. The second
case is stayed pending resolution of the first case. We intend
to continue to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims.
Additionally, another shareholder has sued the Company in
Louisiana making allegations similar to those made in the
securities class action referred to above and by the plaintiffs
claiming damages for having held stock. The case has been
removed to federal court and transferred to Texas where we are
seeking a dismissal.

The Company has been defending allegations related generally to
the termination of two separate joint ventures to which one of
our wholly-owned subsidiaries was a party. The claims in both
proceedings involve the value of the joint ventures. The joint
venture relationships have ended and the contributed assets have
been divested by the Company. The first of these proceedings was
settled in the fourth quarter through a price adjustment that
resulted in us paying additional consideration for our
acquisition of the plaintiff’s interest in the joint
venture. The second matter has been fully tried and we are
awaiting a final ruling. The parties in this matter are seeking
a variety of remedies, ranging from monetary damages to
unwinding the transaction; however, the nature and extent of the
outcome cannot be predicted at this time.

From time to time, we pay fines or penalties in environmental
proceedings relating primarily to waste treatment, storage or
disposal facilities. As of December 31, 2005, there were
four proceedings involving our subsidiaries where we reasonably
believe that the sanctions could exceed $100,000. The matters
involve allegations that subsidiaries (i) improperly
operated a solid waste landfill by failing to maintain required
records, properly place and cover waste and adhere to proper
leachate levels; (ii) failed to comply with air permit and
emission limit requirements at an operating landfill;
(iii) failed to maintain adequate leachate



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

storage capacity at two operating landfills; and
(iv) violated federal and state air pollution control
statutes and rules, state solid waste and ground water
protection statutes and rules and state permits at an operating
landfill. We do not believe that the fines or other penalties in
any of these matters will, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

From time to time, we also are named as defendants in personal
injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class
actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported
waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have
contaminated the environment or, in certain cases, on the basis
of having conducted environmental remediation activities at
sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of
monitoring and health care examinations of allegedly affected
sites and persons for a substantial period of time even where no
actual damage is proven. While we believe we have meritorious
defenses to these lawsuits, the ultimate resolution is often
substantially uncertain due to the difficulty of determining the
cause, extent and impact of alleged contamination (which may
have occurred over a long period of time), the potential for
successive groups of complainants to emerge, the diversity of
the individual plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential
contribution or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or
other third parties, among other factors. Accordingly, it is
possible such matters could have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

It is not always possible to predict the impact that lawsuits,
proceedings, investigations and inquiries may have on us, nor is
it possible to predict whether additional suits or claims may
arise out of the matters described above in the future. We
intend to defend ourselves vigorously in all the above matters.
However, it is possible that the outcome of any of the matters
described, or others, may ultimately have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows in one or more future periods.

Under Delaware law, corporations are allowed to indemnify their
officers, directors and employees against claims arising from
their actions in such capacities if the individuals acted in
good faith and in a manner they believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of the corporation. Further,
corporations are allowed to advance expenses to the individuals
in such matters, contingent upon the receipt of an undertaking
by the individuals to repay all expenses if it is ultimately
determined that they did not act in good faith and in a manner
they believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of
the corporation. Like many Delaware companies, WMI’s
charter and bylaws require indemnification and advancement of
expenses if these standards have been met. Additionally, the
charter and bylaw documents of certain of WMI’s
subsidiaries, including WM Holdings, include similar
indemnification provisions, and some subsidiaries, including
WM Holdings, entered into separate indemnification
agreements with their officers and directors prior to our
acquisition of them that provide for even greater rights and
protections for the individuals.

In March 2002, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against six former
officers of WM Holdings in federal court in the Northern
District of Illinois (the “Court”). Neither WMI nor
any of its subsidiaries was a party to the proceeding. However,
we had been advancing these individuals’ defense costs
since the inception of the case and would have been obligated to
continue advancing defense costs through the conclusion of this
case pursuant to applicable charter and bylaw provisions of
WM Holdings, as well as individual indemnification
agreements. One of the defendants settled with the SEC in
September 2004 by payment of a penalty and disgorgement and
interest amounts of less than one million dollars.

In connection with the SEC’s settlement with all except one
of the defendants, WMI and WM Holdings entered into a
settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with
the individuals whereby we agreed to pay approximately
$26.8 million to the Court, as payment of the disgorgement
and interest amounts that these individuals agreed to pay in
settlement of the SEC’s claims against them. The
individuals paid their own fines and penalties totaling
$4.1 million, which was not reimbursed or paid by us. The
Settlement Agreement was expressly conditioned on the Court
issuing a final and non-appealable Plan of Distribution
distributing an amount not less than the $26.8 million to
WMI’s stockholders. On September 1, 2005, we funded
the agreed amount of $26.8 million, and in October 2005
distributions of $27.5 million were made to WMI’s
stockholders



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of record as of August 25, 2005. We continue to advance the
defense costs, which may be substantial, for the one remaining
defendant in the lawsuit.

The Company may in the future incur substantial expenses in
connection with the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and
indemnification obligations in connection with current actions
involving former officers of the Company or its subsidiaries or
other actions or proceedings that may be brought against its
former or current officers, directors and employees in the
future. The Company’s obligations to indemnify and advance
expenses continue after individuals leave the Company for claims
related to actions that occurred before their departure from the
Company.

We are involved in routine civil litigation and governmental
proceedings, including litigation involving former employees and
competitors arising in the ordinary course of our business. We
do not believe that any such matters will ultimately have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Tax matters

— We are currently under audit by
the IRS and from time to time are audited by other taxing
authorities. We fully cooperate with all audits, but defend our
positions vigorously. Our audits are in various stages of
completion. We have concluded several audits in the last two
years and the financial statement impacts of concluding these
audits is discussed in Note 8. We are currently in the
examination phase of the IRS audit for the years 2002 and 2003.
We expect that this audit could be completed within the next
three months. In addition, we are anticipating the initiation in
2006 of an IRS audit for the year 2004. To provide for certain
potential tax exposures, we maintain an allowance for specific
tax contingencies, the balance of which management believes is
adequate. Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities
could have a material effect on our quarterly or annual cash
flows as audits are completed, although we do not believe that
current tax audit matters will have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations.

Unclaimed property audits

— We are currently in
the preliminary phases of audits, which are being conducted by
various state authorities, of our compliance with unclaimed
property laws. State and federal escheat laws generally require
entities to report and return abandoned and unclaimed property.
Failure to timely report and remit the property can result in
assessments that include substantial interest and penalties, in
addition to the payment of the escheat liability itself.
Although we cannot currently estimate the potential financial
impacts that these audit findings may have, we do not expect any
resulting obligations to have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

Restructuring

2003 Restructurings and Workforce Reductions

—
In February 2003, we reduced the number of Market Areas that
make up our geographic operating Groups and reduced certain
overhead positions in order to improve the efficiency of our
organization. In connection with the restructuring, we reduced
our workforce by about 700 employees and 270 contract workers.
We recorded $20 million of pre-tax charges for costs
associated with this restructuring and workforce reduction, all
of which was associated with employee severance and benefit
costs. The operational efficiencies provided by the February
2003 organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our
workforce in June 2003. This workforce reduction resulted in the
elimination of an additional 600 employee positions and 200
contract worker positions. In 2003, we recorded $24 million
of pre-tax charges for costs associated with the June 2003
workforce reduction. During 2004, we recorded a credit of
$1 million to reduce our accrual for employee severance
costs associated with these restructuring and workforce
reductions.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we paid employee
severance and benefit costs of $18 million for the February
2003 restructuring and workforce reduction and $15 million
for the June 2003 workforce reduction. During the year ended
December 31, 2004 we made additional payments for employee
severance and benefit costs of $1 million for the February
2003 restructuring and workforce reduction and $8 million
for



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the June 2003 workforce reduction. As of December 31, 2005,
substantially all payments related to the 2003 restructuring and
workforce reductions had been made.

2005 Restructuring and Workforce Reduction

—
During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified
our management structure by reducing our Group and Corporate
staffing levels. This reorganization increases the
accountability and responsibility of our Market Areas and allows
us to streamline business decisions and to reduce costs at the
Group and Corporate offices. Additionally, as part of our
restructuring, the responsibility for the management of our
Canadian operations has been assumed by our Eastern, Midwest and
Western Groups, thus eliminating the Canadian Group. See
discussion at Notes 2 and 20.

The reorganization has eliminated about 600 employee positions
throughout the Company. In 2005, we recorded $28 million
for costs associated with the implementation of the new
structure. These charges included $25 million for employee
severance and benefit costs, $1 million related to
abandoned operating lease agreements and $2 million related
to consulting fees incurred to align our sales strategy to our
changes in both resources and leadership that resulted from the
reorganization.

During 2005, we paid $18 million of the employee severance
and benefit costs incurred as a result of this restructuring. As
of December 31, 2005, $7 million of the related
accrual remained for employee severance and benefit costs. The
length of time we are obligated to make severance payments
varies, with the longest obligation continuing through the third
quarter of 2007.

The following table summarizes the total costs recorded to date
for the restructurings by our current reportable segments (in
millions):

The significant transactions and events resulting in asset
impairments, net gains on divestitures and other financial
statement impacts within “Asset impairments and unusual
items” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during
the three years ended December 31, 2005 are discussed below:

Year Ended December 31, 2005

Asset impairments

— During the second quarter
of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a $35 million charge
for the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill located in West
Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania. We determined that an
impairment was necessary after the Pennsylvania Environmental
Hearing Board upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection of a permit application for a vertical
expansion at the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the
Company reviewed the options available at the Pottstown Landfill
and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options.
After such evaluation and considering the length of time
required for the appeal process and the permit application
review, we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial.
This decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the
permitting delays, which would hinder our ability to fully
utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill’s
required closure in 2010. We continued to operate the Pottstown
Landfill using existing permitted airspace through the
landfill’s permit expiration date of October 2005. The
Pottstown Landfill had not been a significant contributor to our
recent earnings nor do we expect the expansion denial to have a
material adverse effect on our future results of operations or
cash flows.

Through June 30, 2005, our “Property and
equipment” had included approximately $80 million of
accumulated costs associated with a revenue management system.
Approximately $59 million of these costs were specifically
associated with the purchase of the software along with efforts
required to develop and configure that software for our use,
while the remaining costs were associated with the general
efforts of integrating a revenue management system with our
existing applications and hardware. The development efforts
associated with our revenue management system were suspended in
2003. Since that time, there have been changes in the viable
software alternatives available to address our current needs.
During the third quarter of 2005, we concluded our assessment of
potential revenue management system options. As a result, we
entered into agreements with a new software vendor for the
license, implementation and maintenance of certain of its
applications software, including waste and recycling
functionality. We believe that these newly licensed
applications, when fully implemented, will provide substantially
better capabilities and functionality than the software we were
developing. Our plan to implement this newly licensed software
resulted in a $59 million charge in the third quarter of
2005 for the software that had been under development and
capitalized costs associated with the development efforts
specific to that software.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an
$18 million charge for asset impairments. This charge was
primarily attributable to the impairment of a landfill in our
Eastern Group, as a result of a change in our expectations for
future expansions, and the impairment of capitalized software
costs related to two applications we decided not to develop
further.

Net gains on divestitures

— During the first
quarter of 2005, we recognized a $39 million gain as a
result of the divestiture of a landfill in Ontario, Canada,
which was required as a result of a Divestiture Order from the
Canadian Competition Bureau. During the remainder of 2005, we
recognized a total of $40 million in gains as a result of
the divestiture of operations. With the exception of our
divestiture of the Ontario, Canada landfill, our divestitures
during 2005 were generally part of our plan to review
under-performing or non-strategic operations and to either
improve their performance or dispose of the operations.

Total proceeds from divestitures completed during the year ended
December 31, 2005 were $172 million, of which
$140 million was received in cash, $23 million was in
the form of a note receivable and $9 million was in the
form of non-monetary assets. We do not believe that these
divestitures are material either individually or in the
aggregate and we do not expect these divestitures to materially
affect our consolidated financial position or future results of
operations or cash flows.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Other

— During the first quarter of 2005, we
recognized a charge of approximately $16 million for the
impact of a litigation settlement reached with a group of
stockholders that opted not to participate in the 2000
settlement of the securities class action lawsuit against us
related to 1998 and 1999 activity. During the third quarter of
2005, we settled our ongoing defense costs and any future
indemnity obligations for four former officers of
WM Holdings related to legacy litigation brought by the SEC
against such former officers. As a result, we recorded a
$26.8 million charge for the funding of the court ordered
distribution to our shareholders for the former officers’
settlement of the litigation. As discussed in Note 10, this
settlement agreement resulted in a distribution of
$27.5 million to WMI shareholders of record as of
August 25, 2005.

These charges were partially offset by the recognition of a
$12 million net benefit recorded during the year ended
December 31, 2005, which was primarily for adjustments to
our receivables and estimated obligations for non-solid waste
operations divested in 1999 and 2000.

Year
Ended December 31, 2004

For 2004, the significant items included within “Asset
impairments and unusual items” were
(i) $17 million in impairment losses primarily due to
the impairment of certain landfill assets and software
development costs; (ii) $12 million in gains on
divestitures that primarily related to certain
Port-O-Let

®

operations; and (iii) $18 million in miscellaneous net
gains, which were primarily for adjustments to our estimated
obligations associated with non-solid waste services, which were
divested in 1999 and 2000.

Year
Ended December 31, 2003

For 2003, the significant items included within “Asset
impairments and unusual items” were $5 million in
impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain
landfill assets and $13 million in gains on divestitures
that primarily related to divested operations in the Western
Group.

Capital Stock, Share Repurchases and Dividends

Capital stock

As of December 31, 2005, we have 552.3 million shares
of common stock issued and outstanding. We have 1.5 billion
shares of authorized common stock with a par value of
$0.01 per common share. The Board of Directors is
authorized to issue preferred stock in series, and with respect
to each series, to fix its designation, relative rights
(including voting, dividend, conversion, sinking fund, and
redemption rights), preferences (including dividends and
liquidation) and limitations. We have ten million shares of
authorized preferred stock, $0.01 par value, none of which
is currently outstanding.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Share repurchases

In February 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had
approved a stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion in
annual repurchases through 2004 to be implemented at
management’s discretion. In August 2003, we amended the
program, starting in 2004, to allow for $1 billion of
annual expenditures for share repurchases, net of dividends. In
2004, our Board of Directors approved a new capital allocation
plan that allows for up to $1.2 billion in annual share
repurchases, net of dividends, for 2005 through 2007. During the
year ended December 31, 2005, we paid $706 million to
repurchase approximately 25 million shares.

The following is a summary of activity under our stock
repurchase programs (in millions, except shares in thousands and
price per share):

In December 2005, we entered into an agreement to repurchase
$275 million of our common stock through an accelerated
share repurchase transaction in January 2006. The number of
shares we repurchase under the accelerated repurchase
transaction is determined by dividing the $275 million by
the fair market value of our common stock on the repurchase
date. Consistent with our previous accelerated repurchase
agreements, at the end of the contractual valuation period we
may be required to make a settlement payment for the difference
between the $275 million paid at the inception of the
agreement and the weighted average daily market price of our
common stock during the valuation period times the number of
shares we repurchased. We would be required to make such a
settlement payment if the weighted average daily market price of
our stock during the valuation period is higher than the
weighted average per share price we initially pay. If such a
settlement payment is required, we may elect to settle in either
cash or shares of our common stock.

Dividends

In August 2003, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly
dividend program, which began in the first quarter of 2004.
Under this program, we declared and paid a dividend of
$0.20 per share in each quarter of 2005 and of
$0.1875 per share in each quarter of 2004. The payment of
our quarterly dividends resulted in cash



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

dividends of $449 million in 2005 and $432 million in
2004. Before this program was implemented, we paid an annual
$0.01 per share dividend, which resulted in a
$6 million dividend payment in 2003. In October 2005, the
Board of Directors announced that it expects future quarterly
dividend payments will be $0.22 per share. On
December 15, 2005, the Board declared our first quarterly
dividend for 2006 of $0.22 per share, which will be paid on
March 24, 2006 to stockholders of record as of
March 6, 2006. All future dividend declarations are at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various
factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash
required for future prospects and other factors the Board may
deem relevant.

Stock-Based Compensation

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which an aggregate
of 4.25 million shares has been reserved for issuance since
the plan’s adoption in 1997. Under the Stock Purchase Plan,
employees that have been employed for at least 30 days may
participate in the plan and make purchases of shares of our
common stock at a discount. The plan provides for two offering
periods for purchases: January through June and July through
December. At the end of each offering period, employees are able
to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of
the lesser of the market value of the stock on the first or last
day of such offering period. The purchases are made through
payroll deductions, and the number of shares that may be
purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The total number of
shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in each of
2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately 675,000, 654,000 and
597,000, respectively. Including the impact of the January 2006
issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2005
offering period, approximately 165,000 shares remain
available for issuance under the plan.

Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is “compensatory”
under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly,
beginning January 1, 2006 we will recognize compensation
expense associated with our employees’ participation in the
Stock Purchase Plan. Based on historical participation levels,
we expect our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase annual
compensation expense by approximately $5 million, or
$3 million net of tax. Refer to Note 23 for additional
information related to the expected impact of adopting
SFAS No. 123(R).

Employee Stock Incentive Plans

Pursuant to our stock incentive plan, we have the ability to
issue stock options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights,
all on terms and conditions determined by the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors.

As of December 31, 2003, we had three plans under which we
granted stock options and restricted stock awards: the 1993
Stock Incentive Plan, the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2000
Broad-Based Plan. All three plans allowed for grants of stock
options, appreciation rights and stock awards to key employees,
except grants under the 2000 Broad-Based Plan could not be made
to any executive officer. All of the options granted under these
plans had exercise prices equaling the fair market value as of
the date of the grant, expired no later than ten years from the
date of grant and vested ratably over a four or five-year
period. The 1993 Stock Incentive Plan expired in May of 2003.

In May 2004, our stockholders approved the adoption of the 2004
Stock Incentive Plan, which included stockholder approval of an
allocation of 22.5 million additional shares for equity
compensation. The terms of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan also
allowed for all shares available under our 2000 Stock Incentive
Plan and our 1996 Non-Employee Director Plan, discussed below,
to become available for issuance under the 2004 Stock Incentive
Plan. Under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, an aggregate of
34 million shares of our common stock may be issued
pursuant to awards granted under the plan. Under this plan,
stock options have exercise prices equal to the fair market
value of our common stock as of the date of grant, expire ten
years from the



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

date of grant and vest ratably over a four-year period. The
restricted stock grants made under the plan also vest ratably
over a four-year period. The restricted shares issued are
subject to forfeiture in the event of termination of employment
and entitle the holder to all benefits of a stockholder,
including the right to receive dividends and vote on all matters
put to a vote of security holders.

On December 16, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our
Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of
all unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive
plans effective December 28, 2005. The decision to
accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options was made
primarily to reduce the non-cash compensation expense that we
would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a result of
adopting SFAS No. 123(R). We estimate that the
acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of
pre-tax compensation charges that would have been recognized
over the next three years as the stock options vested. We
recognized a $2 million pre-tax charge to compensation
expense during the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the
acceleration, but will not be required to recognize future
compensation expense for the accelerated options under
SFAS No. 123(R) unless further modifications are made
to the options, which is not anticipated.

As a result of both the changes in accounting for share-based
payments discussed in Note 23 and a desire to design our
long-term incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger
link to operating and market performance, our Board of Directors
approved a substantial change in the form of awards that we
grant. As discussed above, through December 31, 2004, stock
option awards were the primary form of equity-based
compensation. Beginning in 2005, our long-term incentive plan
includes grants of restricted stock units and performance share
units. Currently, we do not intend to include stock option
awards as a component of our future long-term incentive plans.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we granted
approximately 762,000 restricted stock units with an average
fair value at the date of grant of $28.96 and approximately
760,000 performance share units with an average fair value at
the date of grant of $26.70 to selected participants under our
2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted stock units vest
ratably over a four-year period, and unvested units are subject
to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause
termination. The restricted stock units become immediately
vested in the event of an employee’s death or disability
and continue to vest for up to 36 months following an
employee’s retirement. The performance share units are
payable in shares of common stock based on the achievement of
certain financial measures, after the end of a three-year
performance period. The performance share units are also payable
to an employee (or their beneficiary) upon death, disability or
retirement as if that employee had remained employed until the
end of the performance period, but are subject to forfeiture in
the event of voluntary or for-cause termination.

In accordance with APB No. 25, compensation expense
associated with restricted stock and restricted stock units that
continue to vest based on future employment is measured based on
the grant-date fair value of our common stock and is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the required employment period,
which is generally the vesting period. Compensation expense
associated with performance share units that continue to vest
based on future performance is measured based on the fair value
of our common stock at each balance sheet date and recognized
ratably over the performance period based on our expectations
for achieving the defined performance criteria.

Compensation expense included in reported net income associated
with restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance
share units was $17 million, or $11 million net of
tax, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately
$6 million, or $4 million net of tax, of the current
year’s expense is associated with the recognition of
compensation costs for restricted stock, restricted stock units
and performance share units that were granted to employees who
were either eligible for retirement at the date of grant or have
become eligible for retirement during the vesting period. As
discussed above, the provisions of these awards provide for
continued vesting upon retirement and, as a result, the future
vesting in awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is
not dependent upon future service. Accordingly, compensation
expense associated with the



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

portion of restricted stock, restricted stock unit and
performance share unit grants that does not require future
service has been recognized immediately. As restricted stock,
restricted stock units and performance share units were not a
significant component of our stock incentive plan in 2004 or
2003, compensation costs included in reported net income were
insignificant.

Non-Employee Director Plans

Pursuant to our 2003 Directors’ Deferred Compensation
Plan, a portion of the cash compensation that our directors
would otherwise receive is deferred until after their
termination from board service and each director may elect to
defer the remaining cash compensation to a date that he chooses,
which must be after termination of board service. At that time,
all deferred compensation is paid in shares of our common stock.
The number of shares the directors receive is calculated on the
date the cash compensation would have been payable, based on the
fair market value of our common stock on that day.

Other

We have outstanding warrants that we issued to non-employees for
goods and services through 1997 in individual arrangements.
These warrants generally vest over a period of time, up to five
years, and have terms of up to ten years. All of the warrants
have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our
common stock on the date they were granted. Additionally, we
have outstanding options and warrants that we acquired in
acquisitions. At the time of those acquisitions, the options and
warrants were converted into the right to purchase shares of our
common stock. These options and warrants generally continue to
vest under their original schedules, which range up to five
years, although some vested immediately upon the change in
control related to the acquisition.

We generally issue treasury stock upon exercises of stock
options and warrants. When issuing shares of treasury stock, the
difference between the stock option or warrant exercise price
and the average treasury stock cost is recorded as an addition
to or deduction from additional paid in capital.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We have determined the estimated fair value amounts of our
financial instruments using available market information and
commonly accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable
judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the
instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use
of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could
have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The fair
value estimates are based on information available as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004. These amounts have not been
revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value
could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable,
financial instruments included in other receivables and certain
financial instruments included in other assets or other
liabilities are reflected in our Consolidated Financial
Statements at historical cost, which is materially
representative of their fair value principally because of the
short-term maturities of these instruments.

Long-term investments

— Included as a component
of “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 is
$51 million and $148 million, respectively, of
restricted investments in U.S. government agency debt
securities and other fixed income investments. At
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we also had
$70 million and $82 million, respectively, of
restricted investments in equity-based mutual funds. These
investments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains
and losses on these instruments are deferred as a component of
“Accumulated other comprehensive income” in the equity
section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to
Note 13. There has not been a material difference between
the cost basis and fair market value of these investments in
either 2005 or 2004.

Debt and interest rate derivatives

— At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of our debt
was approximately $8.7 billion and $8.6 billion,
respectively. The carrying value includes adjustments for both
the unamortized fair value adjustments related to terminated
hedge arrangements and fair value adjustments of debt
instruments that are currently hedged. See Note 7. For
active hedge arrangements, the fair value of the derivative is
included in other current assets, other long-term assets,
accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as
appropriate. The estimated fair value of our debt was
approximately $9.2 billion at both December 31, 2005
and 2004. The estimated fair values of our senior notes and
convertible subordinated notes are based on quoted market
prices. The carrying value of remarketable debt approximates
fair value due to the short-term nature of the attached interest
rates. The fair value of our other debt is estimated using
discounted cash flow analysis, based on rates we would currently
pay for similar types of instruments.

18.

Business Combinations and Divestitures

Purchase Acquisitions

We continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are
accretive to our solid waste operations. For both 2005 and 2004,
we have seen the greatest opportunities for realizing superior
returns from tuck-in acquisitions, which are primarily the
purchases of collection operations that enhance our existing
route structures and are strategically located near our existing
disposal operations. During the year ended December 31,
2005, we completed 39 acquisitions for a cost, net of cash
acquired, of $142 million. During the year ended
December 31, 2004, we completed over 50 acquisitions for a
cost, net of cash acquired, of $130 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we paid
$337 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of
approximately 75 businesses. This included $85 million in
the first quarter of 2003 primarily for our acquisition of the
Peltz Group, the largest privately-held recycler in the United
States whose assets we contributed to our Recycling Group’s
operations. The most significant of the other transactions was
the



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquisition of certain collections assets from Allied Waste
Industries, Inc. in the third and fourth quarters of 2003.

Additionally, in 2003 we acquired certain operations from
Bio-Energy Partners, a general partnership in which we have a
50% ownership interest, for $18 million. Bio-Energy
Partners owns and operates facilities that produce electrical
power from landfill gas that is ultimately sold to public
utilities and other commercial users. Concurrent with this
transaction, we received net cash proceeds from Bio-Energy
Partners of $30 million in exchange for assuming a like
amount of indebtedness of the partnership. We continue to
account for our remaining interests in Bio-Energy Partners as an
equity investment.

Divestitures

The approximate aggregate sales price for the divestiture of our
non-integrated operations was $172 million in 2005,
$39 million in 2004 and $18 million in 2003. The
proceeds from these sales were comprised substantially of cash.
We recognized net gains on these divestitures of
$79 million in 2005, $12 million in 2004 and
$13 million in 2003. Additional information related to our
divestiture activity is included in Note 12.

In July 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to divest
certain under-performing and non-strategic operations. At that
time, assets representing approximately $400 million in
annual gross revenues were identified for inclusion in this
divestiture plan. In January 2006, we identified additional
operations, representing over $500 million in annual gross
revenues, that may also be sold as part of this divestiture
plan. We are in the initial stages of the marketing and
negotiation processes associated with divesting these operations
and currently expect the majority of the planned divestitures to
be complete in the next twelve to eighteen months.

19.

Variable Interest Entities

We have financial interests in various variable interest
entities. Following is a description of all interests that we
consider significant. For purposes of applying FIN 46, we
are considered the primary beneficiary of certain of these
entities. Such entities have been consolidated into our
financial statements as noted below.

Consolidated variable interest entities

Financial Interest in Surety Bonding Company

—
During the third quarter of 2003, we issued a letter of credit
to support the debt of a surety bonding company established by
an unrelated third party to issue surety bonds to the waste
industry and other industries. The letter of credit, which is
valued at $24.8 million as of December 31, 2005,
serves to guarantee the surety bonding company’s
obligations associated with its debt and represents our exposure
to loss associated with our financial interest in the entity.

As of December 31, 2005, $60 million of current
assets, $6 million of long-term assets, $33 million of
current liabilities, $22 million of long-term debt and
$11 million in minority interest have been included in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of applying FIN 46
to this variable interest entity.

Although we are the primary beneficiary of this variable
interest entity, the creditors of the entity do not have
recourse against our general credit and our losses are limited
to our exposure under the guarantee. Consolidation of this
entity did not materially impact our results of operations
during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003 nor
do we anticipate that it will materially impact our results of
operations in the foreseeable future. See Note 10 for
additional discussion related to our financial assurance
activities.

Waste-to

-Energy
LLCs

— On June 30, 2000, two limited
liability companies (“LLCs”) were established to
purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at
three

waste-to

-energy
facilities that we operate under an agreement with the owner.
John Hancock Life Insurance Company (“Hancock”) has a
99.5% ownership interest in one of the LLCs (“LLC I”),
and the second LLC (“LLC II”) is 99.75% collectively



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

owned by LLC I and the CIT Group (“CIT”). We own the
remaining equity interest in each LLC. Hancock and CIT made an
initial investment of $167 million in the LLCs. The LLCs
used these proceeds to purchase the three

waste-to

-energy
facilities that we operate and assumed the seller’s
indebtedness related to these facilities. Under the LLC
agreements, the LLCs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of
any of the following events: (i) a written decision of all
the members of the LLCs to dissolve, (ii) December 31,
2063, (iii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution
under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, or
(iv) the LLCs ceasing to own any interest in the

waste-to

-energy
facilities.

Income, losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based
on their initial capital account balances until Hancock and CIT
achieve targeted returns; thereafter, the earnings of LLC I will
be allocated 20% to Hancock and 80% to us and the earnings of
LLC II will be allocated 20% to Hancock and CIT and 80% to
us. We do not expect Hancock and CIT to achieve the targeted
returns at any time during the initial base term of the leases.
We are required under certain circumstances to make capital
contributions to the LLCs in the amount of the difference
between the stipulated loss amounts and terminated values under
the LLC agreements to the extent they are different from the
underlying lease agreements. We believe that the likelihood of
the occurrence of these circumstances is remote. Additionally,
if we exercise certain renewal options under the leases, we will
be required to make payments to the LLCs for the difference
between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents, if
any.

As of December 31, 2005, our Consolidated Balance Sheet
includes $377 million of net property and equipment
associated with the LLCs’

waste-to

-energy
facilities, $86 million of debt associated with the
financing of the facilities and $221 million in minority
interest associated with Hancock and CIT’s interests in the
LLCs.

Trusts for Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation
Obligations

— We have determined that we are the
primary beneficiary of trust funds that were created to settle
certain of our closure, post-closure or environmental
remediation obligations. As the trust funds are expected to
continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were
established, we do not believe that there is any material
exposure to loss associated with the trusts. The consolidation
of these variable interest entities has not materially affected
our financial position or results of operations in 2005 or 2004.

Significant unconsolidated variable interest
    entities

Investments in Coal-Based Synthetic Fuel Production
Facilities

— As discussed in Note 8, we own
an interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production
facilities. Along with the other equity investors, we support
the operations of the entities in exchange for a pro-rata share
of the tax credits generated by the facilities. Our obligation
to support the facilities’ future operations is, therefore,
limited to the tax benefit we expect to receive. We are not the
primary beneficiary of either of these entities, and we do not
believe that we have any material exposure to loss, as measured
under the provisions of FIN 46, as a result of our
investments. As such, we account for these investments under the
equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the
facilities. As of December 31, 2005, our investment in the
facilities is $49 million.

Segment and Related Information

We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and Recycling
Groups. These six operating Groups are presented below as our
reportable segments. Our segments provide integrated waste
management services consisting of collection, disposal (solid
waste and hazardous waste landfills), transfer,

waste-to

-energy
facilities and independent power production plants that are
managed by Wheelabrator, recycling services and other services
to commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The
operations not managed through our six operating Groups are
presented herein as “Other.”

As discussed in Note 2, in the third quarter of 2005, we
eliminated our Canadian Group, and the management of our
Canadian operations was allocated among our Eastern, Midwest and
Western Groups. We have allocated the operating results of our
Canadian operations to the Eastern, Midwest and Western Groups
for all periods presented to provide financial information that
consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
operations.

Our July 2005 reorganization also resulted in the centralization
of certain Group office functions. The administrative costs
associated with these functions were included in the measurement
of income from operations for our reportable segments through
August 2005, when the integration of these functions with our
existing centralized processes was completed. Beginning in
September 2005, these administrative costs have been included in
income from operations of “Corporate.” The
reallocation of these costs has not significantly affected the
operating results of our reportable segments for the periods
presented.

Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Fluctuations in our operating results between quarters may be
caused by many factors, including

period-to

-period
changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of
business and operating segment and general economic conditions.
Our revenues and income from operations typically reflect
seasonal patterns. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat
higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume
of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial
and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also
tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third
quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect
these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather
conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the
year, such as the hurricanes experienced during 2004 and 2005,
actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. However,
for several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such
revenue often generates comparatively lower margins. Certain
weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our
operations, which can significantly affect the operating results
of the affected regions. The operating results of our first
quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance
expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when
electrical demand is generally lower, to perform scheduled
maintenance at our

waste-to

-energy
facilities.

New Accounting Pronouncements (Unaudited)

SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based
    Payment

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
which amends SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB
No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) requires compensation
expense to be recognized for all share-based payments made to
employees based on the fair value of the award at the date of
grant, eliminating the intrinsic value alternative and narrowing
the non-compensatory exception associated with employee stock
purchase plans allowed by SFAS No. 123. Generally, the
approach to determining fair value under the original
pronouncement has not changed. However, there are revisions to
the accounting guidelines established, such as accounting for
forfeitures, that will affect our accounting for stock-based
awards in the future.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) provide for an
effective date of July 1, 2005 for calendar-year public
companies. However, in April 2005, the Securities and Exchange
Commission adopted a rule that amends the compliance dates for
SFAS No. 123(R), making it effective at the beginning
of the first fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005.
The statement allows companies to adopt its provisions using
either of the following transition alternatives:

(i) The modified prospective method, which results in the
    recognition of compensation expense using SFAS 123(R) for
    all share-based awards granted or modified after the effective
    date and the recognition of compensation expense using
    SFAS 123 for all previously granted share-based awards that
    remain unvested at the effective date; or

(ii) The modified retrospective method, which results in
    applying the modified prospective method and restating prior
    periods by recognizing the financial statement impact of
    share-based payments in a manner consistent with the pro forma
    disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The modified
    retrospective method may be applied to all prior periods
    presented or previously reported interim periods of the year of
    adoption.

We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006
using the modified prospective method.

As disclosed in Note 15, on December 16, 2005, the
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the
acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options
awarded under our stock incentive plans effective
December 28, 2005. The decision to accelerate the vesting
of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the
non-cash compensation expense that we would have otherwise
recorded in future periods as a result of adopting
SFAS No. 123(R). We estimate that the acceleration
eliminated approximately $55 million of pre-tax
compensation charges that would have been recognized over the
next three years as the stock options vested. We recognized a
$2 million pre-tax charge to compensation expense during
the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the acceleration, but
will not be required to recognize future compensation expense
for the accelerated options under SFAS No. 123(R)
unless further modifications are made to the options, which is
not anticipated. As a result of the acceleration, we do not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) to materially
impact our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed
