PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation;
    Waste Management’s wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which
    Waste Management or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary
    as described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Waste Management is a holding company and all
    operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. When the terms
    “the Company,” “we,” “us” or
    “our” are used in this document, those terms refer to
    Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and
    consolidated variable interest entities. When we use the term
    “WM,” we are referring only to Waste Management, Inc.,
    the parent holding company.

WM was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name “USA
    Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a Delaware
    company in 1995. In a 1998 merger, the Illinois-based waste
    services company formerly known as Waste Management, Inc. became
    a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM and changed its name to Waste
    Management Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”). At the
    same time, our parent holding company changed its name from USA
    Waste Services to Waste Management, Inc. Like WM,
    WM Holdings is a holding company and all operations are
    conducted by subsidiaries. For detail on the financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows of WM, WM Holdings and
    their subsidiaries, see Note 23 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
    Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone
    number at that address is

(713) 512-6200.

Our annual reports on

Form 10-K,

quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q

and current reports on

Form 8-K

are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as
    practicable after we file the reports with the SEC. Our stock is
    traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
    “WM.”

We are the leading provider of comprehensive waste management
    services in North America. Our subsidiaries provide collection,
    transfer, recycling, and disposal services. We are also a
    leading developer, operator and owner of

waste-to-energy

and landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities in the United States. Our customers include
    residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers
    throughout North America. During 2010, our largest customer
    represented approximately 2% of annual revenues. We employed
    approximately 42,800 people as of December 31, 2010.

Through our core waste management services, we own or operate
    271 landfill sites, which is the largest network of
    landfills in our industry. In order to make disposal more
    practical for larger urban markets, where the distance to
    landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities is typically farther, we manage 294 transfer stations
    that consolidate, compact and transport waste efficiently and
    economically. We also use waste to create energy. One method we
    use involves recovering the naturally occurring gas in landfills
    for use in the generation of electricity. We also use waste to
    create energy through a highly efficient combustion process. Our

waste-to-energy

subsidiary, Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., operates 22 plants
    that produce clean, renewable energy. We are a leading recycler
    in North America, handling materials that include paper,
    cardboard, glass, plastic, metal and electronics. Through our
    recycling operations, we provide cost-efficient, environmentally
    sound programs for municipalities, businesses and households
    across the U.S. and Canada. In addition to traditional
    waste operations, we are also expanding to increase the service
    offerings we provide for our customers.

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers,
    our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work
    and our stockholders, and achievement of our goals is intended
    to meet the needs of a changing industry. The waste industry
    continues to confront significant changes. In recent years
    landfill volumes have declined, and customers are increasingly
    using alternatives to traditional disposal, such as recycling
    and composting, while also working to reduce the waste they
    generate. Accomplishment of our goals will grow our Company and
    allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as
    they, too, Think
    Green

®

.

    We believe that helping our customers achieve their
    environmental goals will enable us to achieve profitable growth.

Our strategic focus is centered on three long-term goals: know
    more about our customers and how to service them than anyone
    else; use conversion and processing technology to extract more
    value from the materials we



manage; and continuously improve our operational efficiency. We
    intend to pursue achievement of our long-term goals in the
    short-term through efforts to:

•

Grow our markets by implementing customer-focused growth,
    through customer segmentation and through strategic
    acquisitions, while maintaining our pricing discipline and
    increasing the amount of recyclable materials we handle each
    year;

•

Grow our customer loyalty, in part through the use of enabling
    technologies;

•

Grow into new markets by investing in greener
    technologies; and

•

Pursue initiatives that improve our operations and cost
    structure.

We believe that execution of our strategy, including making the
    investments required by our strategy, will provide long-term
    value to our stockholders. In addition, we intend to continue to
    return value to our stockholders through common stock
    repurchases and dividend payments. In December 2010, we
    announced that our Board of Directors expects that quarterly
    dividend payments will be increased to $0.34 per share in 2011,
    which is an 8% increase from the quarterly dividend we paid in
    2010. This will result in an increase in the amount of free cash
    flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the eighth
    consecutive year and is an indication of our ability to generate
    strong and consistent cash flows. All quarterly dividends will
    be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

Operations

General

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through five
    Groups. Our four geographic operating Groups, comprised of our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, provide
    collection, transfer, disposal (in both solid waste and
    hazardous waste landfills) and recycling services. Our fifth
    Group is the Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to-energy

services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent
    power production plants, or IPPs. We also provide additional
    services that are not managed through our five Groups, as
    described below. These operations are presented in this report
    as “Other.”

The table below shows the total revenues (in millions)
    contributed annually by each of our Groups, or reportable
    segments, in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010.
    More information about our results of operations by reportable
    segment is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and in

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins
    with a vast waste collection network. Collection involves
    picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from
    where it was generated to a transfer station, material recovery
    facility (“MRF”) or disposal site. We generally
    provide collection services under one of two types of
    arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we
    have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the
    agreements are influenced by factors such as collection
    frequency, type of collection equipment we furnish, type and
    volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the
    disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general
    market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel
    containers to most customers to store their solid waste between

pick-up

dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs
    of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many
    are designed to be lifted mechanically and either emptied into a
    truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site.
    By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial
    and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one
    employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract
    with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality,
    homeowners’ association or some other regional authority
    that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of
    the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are
    typically for periods of three to five years. We also provide
    services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to
    households. The fees for residential collection are either paid
    by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or
    service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving
    the service.

Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories
    for solid waste in North America. At December 31, 2010, we
    owned or operated 266 solid waste landfills, which represents
    the largest network of landfills in North America. Solid waste
    landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering
    safeguards that limit the possibility of water and air
    pollution, and are operated under procedures prescribed by
    regulation. A landfill must meet federal, state or provincial,
    and local regulations during its design, construction, operation
    and closure. The operation and closure activities of a solid
    waste landfill include excavation, construction of liners,
    continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering of waste
    with earth or other acceptable material and constructing the cap
    of the landfill. These operations are carefully planned to
    maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use
    of the airspace.

All solid waste management companies must have access to a
    disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. The
    significant capital requirements of developing and operating a
    landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and, as a
    result, third-party haulers often dispose of waste at our
    landfills. It is usually preferable for our collection
    operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate, a
    practice we refer to as internalization, rather than using
    third-party disposal facilities. Internalization generally
    allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger
    operating cash flows. The fees charged at disposal facilities,
    which are referred to as tipping fees, are based on several
    factors, including competition and the type and weight or volume
    of solid waste deposited.



We also operate five secure hazardous waste landfills in the
    United States. Under environmental laws, the federal government
    (or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all
    hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills
    have obtained the required permits, although some can accept
    only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also
    comply with specialized operating standards. Only hazardous
    waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory
    requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In
    some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal.
    Generally, these treatments involve the separation or removal of
    solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that
    transform waste into inert materials that are no longer
    hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed
    and operated in a manner designed to provide long-term
    containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility
    at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by
    injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain
    acceptable geologic formations far below the base of fresh water
    to a point that is safely separated by other substantial
    geological confining layers.

Transfer.

At December 31, 2010, we owned
    or operated 294 transfer stations in North America. We deposit
    waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid
    waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume
    and increase the density of the waste and transported by
    transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect
    waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities.
    Fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually
    based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at
    the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site and
    general market factors.

The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection
    operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain
    fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the
    disposal of the waste we collect. It enables us to manage costs
    associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks,
    railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than
    collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the
    disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated
    and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically
    located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations;
    and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer
    of the waste to one of our own disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do not own generally
    are operated through lease agreements under which we lease
    property from third parties. There are some instances where
    transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for
    municipalities. In most cases we own the permits and will be
    responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the
    operation and closure of the transfer station.

Wheelabrator.

As of December 31, 2010, we
    owned or operated 17

waste-to-energy

facilities and five independent power production plants which
    are located in the Northeast, in the Mid-Atlantic, and in
    Florida, California and Washington.

At our

waste-to-energy

facilities, solid waste is burned at high temperatures in
    specially designed boilers to produce heat that is converted
    into high-pressure steam. As of December 31, 2010, our

waste-to-energy

facilities were capable of processing up to 22,300 tons of solid
    waste each day. In 2010, our

waste-to-energy

facilities received and processed 7.5 million tons of solid
    waste, or approximately 20,700 tons per day.

Our IPPs convert various waste and conventional fuels into
    steam. The plants burn wood waste, anthracite coal waste (culm),
    tires, landfill gas and natural gas. These facilities are
    integral to the solid waste industry, disposing of urban wood,
    waste tires, railroad ties and utility poles. Our anthracite
    culm facility in Pennsylvania processes the waste materials left
    over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago.
    Ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land
    damaged by decades of coal mining.

We generate steam at our

waste-to-energy

and IPP facilities for the production of electricity. We sell
    the electricity produced at our facilities into wholesale
    markets, which include investor-owned utilities, power marketers
    and regional power pools. Some of our facilities also sell steam
    directly to end users. Fees charged for electricity and steam at
    our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs have generally been subject to the terms and
    conditions of long-term contracts that include interim
    adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market
    conditions such as inflation, electricity prices and other
    general market factors. During 2010 and 2009, several of our
    long-term energy contracts and short-term pricing arrangements
    expired, significantly increasing our

waste-to-energy

revenues’ exposure to volatility attributable to changes in
    market prices for electricity, which generally correlate with
    fluctuations in natural gas prices in the markets in which we
    operate. Our market-price



volatility will continue to increase as additional long-term
    contracts expire. We use short-term “receive fixed, pay
    variable” electricity commodity swaps to mitigate the
    variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by
    fluctuations in the market prices for electricity. Refer to the

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

section of this report for additional information about the
    Company’s current considerations related to the management
    of this market exposure.

We continue to look at opportunities to expand our

waste-to-energy

business. In 2010, we made two investments which increased the
    total assets of our Wheelabrator Group by $318 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2010. In the first quarter of
    2010, we paid $142 million to acquire a 40% equity
    investment in Shanghai Environment Group (“SEG”), a
    subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co., Ltd. As a joint
    venture partner in SEG, we will participate in the operation and
    management of

waste-to-energy

and other waste services in the Chinese market. SEG will also
    focus on building new

waste-to-energy

facilities in China. As of December 31, 2010, SEG owned and
    operated two

waste-to-energy

facilities, five landfills and five transfer stations. An
    additional five

waste-to-energy

facilities were under construction. Our share of SEG’s
    earnings are included in “Equity in net losses in
    unconsolidated entities” in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. In the second quarter of 2010, we paid
    $150 million for the acquisition of a

waste-to-energy

facility in Portsmouth, Virginia. Additionally, Wheelabrator is
    actively pursuing development projects with industry partners
    and pursuing other opportunities to provide

waste-to-energy

services in the United Kingdom.

Recycling.

Our recycling operations focus on
    improving the sustainability and future growth of recycling
    programs within communities and industries. In 2001, we became
    the first major solid waste company to focus on residential
    single-stream recycling, which allows customers to mix
    recyclable paper, plastic and glass in one bin. Residential
    single-stream programs have greatly increased the recycling
    rates. Single-stream recycling is possible through the use of
    various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies. We
    have also been advancing the single-stream recycling programs
    for commercial applications. Recycling involves the separation
    of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing and
    resale or other disposition. Our recycling operations include
    the following:

Materials processing

— Through our collection
    operations, we collect recyclable materials from residential,
    commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials
    to one of our MRFs for processing. We operate 98 MRFs where
    paper, cardboard, metals, plastics, glass, construction and
    demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are
    recovered for resale. We also operate nine secondary processing
    facilities where recyclable materials can be further processed
    into raw products used in the manufacturing of consumer goods.
    Materials processing services include data destruction and
    automated color sorting.

Plastics materials recycling

— Using

state-of-the-art

sorting and processing technology, we process, inventory and
    sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more
    cost effective and convenient.

Commodities recycling

— We market and resell
    recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the
    marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our
    facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that
    continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market demands
    and product quality.

Fees for recycling services are influenced by the type of
    recyclable commodities being processed, the volume or weight of
    the recyclable material, degree of processing required, the
    market value of the recovered material and other market factors.

Some of the recyclable materials processed in our MRFs are
    purchased from various sources, including third parties and our
    own operations. The cost per ton of material purchased is based
    on market prices and the cost to transport the processed goods
    to our customers to whom we sell such materials. The price we
    pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a
    “rebate.” Rebates generally are based upon the price
    we receive for sales of processed goods and on market
    conditions, but in some cases are based on fixed contractual
    rates or on defined minimum per-ton rates. As a result, changes
    in commodity prices for recycled fiber can significantly affect
    our revenues, the rebates we pay to our suppliers and our
    operating income and margins.



Other.

Other services not managed within our
    Groups include the following:

We provide recycling brokerage services, which includes managing
    the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties. The
    experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable
    commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed
    to effectively manage volumes for third parties. Utilizing the
    resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’
    service centers, we can assist customers in marketing and
    selling their recyclable commodities with little to no capital
    requirements. We also provide electronics recycling. We recycle
    discarded computers, communications equipment, and other
    electronic equipment. Services include the collection, sorting
    and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or
    recycle all collected materials. In recent years, we have teamed
    with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive
    “take-back” programs of their products to assist the
    general public in disposing of their old electronics in a
    convenient and environmentally safe manner.

We provide sustainability services to businesses through our
    Upstream

®

and Green
    Squad

®

organizations. This includes in-plant services, where our
    employees work full-time inside our customers’ facilities
    to provide full-service waste management solutions and
    consulting services. Our vertically integrated waste management
    operations enable us to provide customers with full management
    of their waste. The breadth of our service offerings and the
    familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the
    unique ability to assist customers in minimizing waste they
    generate, identifying recycling opportunities and determining
    the most efficient means available for waste collection and
    disposal.

We develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial use
    of landfill gas through our Waste Management Renewable Energy
    Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes
    in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill gas is a
    readily available, renewable energy source that can be gathered
    and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel. The EPA
    endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, in the
    same category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At
    December 31, 2010, landfill gas beneficial use projects
    were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 127 of
    our solid waste landfills. At 97 of these landfills, the
    processed gas is delivered to electricity generators. The
    electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal
    utilities or power cooperatives. At 21 landfills, the gas
    is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct
    substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. At nine
    landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality
    natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers.

Our WM Healthcare Solutions subsidiary offers integrated medical
    waste services for healthcare facilities, pharmacies and
    individuals. We provide full-service solutions to facilities to
    assist them in best practices, identifying waste streams and
    proper disposal. Our healthcare services also include a sharps
    mail return program through which individuals can safely dispose
    of their used syringes and lancets using our MedWaste Tracker
    system.

Although by their very nature many waste management services
    such as collection and disposal are local services, our
    Strategic Accounts program works with customers whose locations
    span the United States. Our Strategic Accounts program provides
    centralized customer service, billing and management of accounts
    to streamline the administration of customers’ multiple and
    nationwide locations’ waste management needs.

We also have begun investing in businesses and technologies that
    are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or
    supplementary to our current operations. These investments
    include joint ventures, acquisitions and partial ownership
    interests. The solutions and services include the collection of
    project waste, including construction debris and household or
    yard waste, through our
    Bagster

®

program; the development, operation and marketing of plasma
    gasification facilities; operation of a landfill

gas-to-liquid

natural gas plant; solar powered trash compactors; and organic

waste-to-fuel

conversion technology. Part of our expansion of services
    includes offering portable self-storage services; and
    fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our
    LampTracker

®

program. In addition, at a time when oil prices were low, we
    decided to pursue investment opportunities that involved
    acquisition and development of non-working interests in oil and
    gas producing properties.

Finally, we rent portable restroom facilities to municipalities
    and commercial customers under the name

Port-o-Let

®

,

    we service such facilities and we provide street and parking lot
    sweeping services.



Competition

The waste industry is very competitive. In North America, the
    industry consists primarily of two national waste management
    companies, regional companies and local companies of varying
    sizes and financial resources, including smaller companies that
    specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management. We
    compete with these companies as well as with counties and
    municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and
    disposal operations.

Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely
    throughout the geographic areas in which we operate. The prices
    that we charge are determined locally, and typically vary by
    volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment
    requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of
    collections, distance to final disposal sites, the availability
    of airspace within the geographic region, labor costs and amount
    and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense
    competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of
    service. We have also begun competing for business based on
    service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities
    begin to look for ways to be more sustainable, we are ensuring
    our customers know about our comprehensive services that go
    beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste.

Seasonal
    Trends

Our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in
    the summer months, primarily due to the traditional seasonal
    increase in the volume of construction and demolition waste. The
    volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions
    where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months.
    Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations
    typically reflect these seasonal trends, although we saw a
    significantly weaker seasonal volume increase during 2009 than
    we generally experience.

Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend
    to occur during the second half of the year, such as the
    hurricanes that most often impact our Southern Group, can
    actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While
    weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can
    boost revenues through additional work, as a result of
    significant

start-up

costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates
    earnings at comparatively lower margins. Certain weather
    conditions, including severe winter storms, may result in the
    temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly
    affect the operating results of the affected regions. The
    operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher
    repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower
    winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

Employees

At December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    42,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,600
    were employed in administrative and sales positions and the
    balance in operations. Approximately 9,300 of our employees are
    covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial
    Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial
    Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally
    require contracting parties to demonstrate financial
    responsibility for their obligations under the contract.
    Financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or
    retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits.
    Various forms of financial assurance also are required to
    support variable-rate tax-exempt debt and by regulatory agencies
    for estimated capping, closure, post-closure and environmental
    remedial obligations at many of our landfills.

We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of
    credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and
    financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on
    several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual
    requirements, market factors and availability of credit
    capacity. The following table



summarizes the various forms and dollar amounts (in millions) of
    financial assurance that we had outstanding as of
    December 31, 2010:

(g)

The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally
    will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Virtually no claims have been made against our financial
    assurance instruments in the past, and considering our current
    financial position, management does not expect there to be
    claims against these instruments that will have a material
    adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In
    2010, we experienced an increase in costs associated with
    letters of credit as a result of the June 2010 refinancing of
    our revolving credit facility. We actively monitor our financial
    assurance needs and optimize the utilization of lower-cost
    instruments when possible to minimize our costs.

Insurance

We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general
    liability, automobile liability, real and personal property,
    workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’
    liability, pollution legal liability and other coverages we
    believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for
    insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident
    deductible under the related insurance policy. As of
    December 31, 2010, our general liability insurance program
    carried self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million per
    incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program
    carried self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per
    incident. As of December 31, 2010, our auto liability
    insurance program included a per-incident base deductible of
    $5 million, subject to additional deductibles of
    $4.8 million in the $5 million to $10 million
    layer. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty,
    property, environmental or other contingency to have a material
    impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows. Our estimated insurance liabilities as of
    December 31, 2010 are summarized in Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
    policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive
    liability, often referred to as “Broad Form Side
    A,” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage,
    often referred to as “Side B.” The Side A policy
    covers directors and officers directly for loss, including
    defense costs, when corporate indemnification is unavailable.
    Side A-only coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the
    Company, as the Company is not insured for any money it advances
    for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors
    and officers.

Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state
    or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and
    transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
    are administered by the U.S. EPA and various other federal,
    state and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use,
    health and safety agencies in the United States and various
    agencies in Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our
    operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations
    and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or
    impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.

Because the major component of our business is the collection
    and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner,
    a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related,
    either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection
    measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial
    and local provisions that regulate the placement of materials
    into the environment. There are costs associated with siting,
    design, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective
    actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and
    post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition,
    development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer
    station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money
    to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There
    cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or
    maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained,
    operating permits are subject to renewal, modification,
    suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with
    these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to
    make significant capital and operating expenditures. However,
    most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of
    business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.



The primary United States federal statutes affecting our
    business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended,
    regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and
    non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop
    programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991,
    the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA,
    which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria
    for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically
    implemented by the states, although states can impose
    requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D
    standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in
    the ordinary course of our operations.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which is also known as
    Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to
    releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the
    environment that have created actual or potential environmental
    hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such
    releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal
    sites upon current and former site owners and operators,
    generators of the hazardous substances at the site and
    transporters who selected the disposal site and transported
    substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on
    the intentional disposal of hazardous substances; it can be
    based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result
    of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of hazardous
    substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable
    statutes and regulations. Liability may include contribution for
    cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action
    or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to
    federal or state regulators in an administrative or
    judicially-approved settlement. Liability under CERCLA could
    also include obligations to a PRP that voluntarily expends site

clean-up

costs. Further, liability for damage to publicly-owned natural
    resources may also be imposed. We are subject to potential
    liability under CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at
    which hazardous substances have been disposed and as a generator
    or transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at other
    locations.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, known as the
    Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into
    streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a
    variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal
    sites. If run-off from our operations may be discharged into
    surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and
    obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and,
    under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants
    in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional
    standards for management of storm water runoff that require
    landfills and other waste-handling facilities to obtain storm
    water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other
    facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a
    publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with
    discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before
    the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect
    “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing
    for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act
    provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for
    violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased
    federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air
    pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the
    requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal
    solid waste landfills and large municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities. Standards have also been imposed on manufacturers of
    transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles).
    In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards and
    emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and
    existing large landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued
    Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for municipal
    solid waste landfills subject to the new source performance
    standards. These regulations impose limits on air emissions from
    large municipal solid waste landfills, subject most of our large
    municipal solid waste landfills to certain operating permitting
    requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act and, in
    many instances, require installation of landfill gas collection
    and control systems to control emissions or to treat and utilize
    landfill gas on or off-site. In 2010, the EPA issued the
    Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, and
    Title V Greenhouse Gas, or GHG, Tailoring Rule which
    expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to
    include the six GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide. Air
    permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste
    landfills,

waste-to-energy

facilities and landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities could be impacted, but the degree of impact is
    incumbent upon the EPA’s final



determination on permitting of biogenic GHG emissions (e.g.
    carbon dioxide) as well as the EPA’s or implementing
    states’ determinations on what may constitute “Best
    Available Control Technology” for new projects exceeding
    certain thresholds. In addition, recent final and proposed
    reductions in certain National Ambient Air Quality Standards and
    related PSD increment/significance thresholds could impact the
    cost, timeliness and availability of air permits for new and
    modified large municipal solid waste landfills,

waste-to-energy

facilities and landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities. In general, controlling emissions involves drilling
    collection wells into a landfill and routing the gas to a
    suitable energy recovery system or combustion device. We are
    currently capturing and utilizing the renewable energy value of
    landfill gas at 127 of our solid waste landfills. Efforts to
    curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the
    effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy
    more stringent emission controls, with resulting capital or
    operating costs. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

— “The adoption of climate change legislation
    or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse
    gases” could increase our costs to operate.”

The EPA has issued new source performance standards and emission
    guidelines for large and small municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities, which include stringent emission limits for various
    pollutants based on Maximum Achievable Control Technology
    standards. These sources are also subject to operating permit
    requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The Clean
    Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards
    applicable to municipal

waste-to-energy

facilities every five years.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended,
    establishes certain employer responsibilities, including
    maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to
    cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards
    promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, and various reporting and record keeping
    obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements.
    Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation
    and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to
    our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along
    with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain
    aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including
    safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies
    with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to
    regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise
    preempted by federal law.

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations
    that affect our operations. Sometimes states’ regulations
    are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not
    otherwise preempted by federal law. Additionally, our collection
    and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and
    regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at
    the source and waste recycling.

Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws
    that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste
    generated outside the state. While laws that overtly
    discriminate against

out-of-state

waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are
    less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court.
    Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted
    “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require
    that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction
    be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the United States
    Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave
    preference to a local facility that was privately owned was
    unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance
    directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was
    constitutional. In addition, from time to time, the United
    States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to
    adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation
    allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of
    legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the
    state level could adversely affect our operations. Courts’
    interpretation of flow control legislation or the Supreme Court
    decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous
    waste management services.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted
    “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have
    jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or
    revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s
    or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states,
    provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the
    compliance history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated
    companies, in addition to the applicant or permit holder. These
    laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an
    applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness



to be awarded a contract to operate, and to deny or revoke a
    contract or permit because of unfitness, unless there is a
    showing that the applicant or permit holder has been
    rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies
    and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    disclosures relating to our current assessments of the impact of
    regulations on our current and future operations.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed
    about our business, we may make “forward-looking
    statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to
    future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or
    other aspects of our operations or operating results.
    Forward-looking statements are often identified by the words,
    “will,” “may,” “should,”
    “continue,” “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “expect,” “plan,”
    “forecast,” “project,” “estimate,”
    “intend” and words of similar nature and generally
    include statements containing:

•

projections about accounting and finances;

•

plans and objectives for the future;

•

projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our
    performance; or

•

our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or
    future events, circumstances or performance.

You should view these statements with caution. These statements
    are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or
    events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as
    of the date the statements are made. All phases of our business
    are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many
    of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone
    or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us
    and could change whether any forward-looking statement
    ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no
    obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result
    of future events, circumstances or developments. The following
    discussion should be read together with the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are
    some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and
    financial statements for 2011 and beyond.

General
    economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our
    revenues and our operating margins.

Our business is directly affected by changes in national and
    general economic factors that are outside of our control,
    including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to
    capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreases
    in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. In
    addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which
    is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels.
    Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may
    limit the number or amount of services requested by customers
    and our ability to implement our pricing strategy. In addition
    to disruption in the credit markets, recent and continuing
    economic conditions have negatively affected business and
    consumer spending generally. If our commercial customers do not
    have access to capital, both our volumes and our ability to
    increase new business will be negatively impacted.

The
    waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot
    successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial
    condition and operating results may be materially adversely
    affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental,
    quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our
    operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of
    two national waste management companies, regional companies and
    local companies of varying sizes and financial resources,
    including smaller companies that specialize in certain discrete
    areas of waste management. We compete with these companies as
    well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own
    waste collection and disposal operations. These counties and
    municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because
    tax revenues are available to them and tax-exempt financing is
    more readily available to them. Also, such governmental units
    may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that
    would give them a competitive advantage. In addition,
    competitors may reduce



their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively-bid
    contracts. When this happens, we may be unable to execute our
    pricing strategy, resulting in a negative impact to our revenue
    growth from yield on base business.

If we
    fail to implement our business strategy, our financial
    performance and our growth could be materially and adversely
    affected.

Our future financial performance and success are dependent in
    large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy
    successfully. We have adopted a business strategy built on three
    key initiatives: know more about our customers and how to
    service them than anyone else; use conversion and processing
    technology to extract more value from the materials we manage;
    and continuously improve our operational efficiency. In the
    short-term, we intend to pursue these initiatives through
    efforts to:

•

Grow our markets by implementing customer-focused growth,
    through customer segmentation and through strategic
    acquisitions, while maintaining our pricing discipline and
    increasing the amount of recyclable materials we handle each
    year;

•

Grow our customer loyalty, in part through the use of enabling
    technologies;

•

Grow into new markets by investing in greener
    technologies; and

•

Pursue initiatives that improve our operations and cost
    structure.

There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the
    following:

•

Our strategy may result in a significant change to our business,
    and our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and
    support our strategy.

•

Customer segmentation is new to our business, and it could
    result in fragmentation of our efforts, rather than improved
    customer relationships.

•

In efforts to enhance our revenues, we have implemented price
    increases and environmental fees, and we have continued our fuel
    surcharge program to offset fuel costs. The loss of volumes as a
    result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows
    or results of operations.

•

Our ability to make strategic acquisitions and invest in greener
    technologies depends on our ability to identify desirable
    acquisition or investment targets, negotiate advantageous
    transactions despite competition for such opportunities, and
    realize the benefits we expect from those transactions.

•

Acquisitions

and/or

investments may not increase our earnings in the timeframe
    anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new
    markets or providing new service offerings, failure to operate
    within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among
    others.

•

We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic
    assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be
    able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of
    underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result
    in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin
    businesses.

In addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our
    business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors
    beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal
    developments, government regulation, general economic
    conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in
    industry trends. Further, we may decide to alter or discontinue
    certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are
    not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our
    long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected.
    Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives
    of our business plan successfully, our operating results may not
    improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.

The
    seasonal nature of our business and “one-time” special
    projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance
    is not necessarily indicative of our future
    results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we



operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our
    second and third quarter revenues and results of operations
    typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain
    destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the
    second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often
    impact our Southern Group, can actually increase our revenues in
    the areas affected. While weather-related and other
    “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through
    additional work, as a result of significant

start-up

costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates
    earnings at comparatively lower margins. During 2010, our
    financial results included revenue generated as a result of

clean-up

efforts in connection with the oil spill along the Gulf Coast
    and the substantial flooding in Tennessee; however, these
    special projects have a limited time span.

Certain weather conditions, including severe weather storms, may
    result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can
    significantly affect the operating results of the affected
    regions. The operating results of our first quarter also often
    reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely
    on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally
    lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim
    period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
    an entire year, and operating results for any historical period
    are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future
    period.

Our
    operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws
    and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, that may
    result in significant liabilities.

There is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities
    in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste
    materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations,
    we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage
    to our properties or to the property of other landowners,
    particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking
    water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable
    for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
    the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular
    concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though
    acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and
    assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence
    investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions
    may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed
    to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the
    transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances
    that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor
    owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are
    treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial
    liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we
    are currently, and we may in the future, become involved in
    legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and
    environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in
    which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to
    impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes
    involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to
    revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and

•

local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental
    agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need,
    allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws
    or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose
    liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons
    involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If
    we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of
    these proceedings could result in, among other things, material
    increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material
    charges for asset impairments.

Further, we often enter into contractual arrangements with
    landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory
    or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination
    of the agreements. Compliance with these arrangements is
    inherently subject to subjective determinations and may result
    in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate or restore
    the condition of closed sites may be significant.



The
    waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation,
    and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations,
    increase our costs of operations or require us to make
    additional capital expenditures.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
    provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have
    a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such
    regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules,
    orders and interpretations govern environmental protection,
    health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related
    matters. Among other things, they may restrict our operations
    and adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

•

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal,
    transfer or processing facilities or on expanding existing
    facilities;

•

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal
    prices, rates and volumes;

•

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of

out-of-state

waste or certain categories of waste; or

•

mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste, including
    requirements to recycle rather than landfill certain waste
    streams.

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of
    landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or
    remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills
    temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations
    may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or
    facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could
    be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste
    management facility, we must have various facility permits and
    other governmental approvals, including those relating to
    zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and
    approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to
    obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

We also have significant financial obligations relating to
    capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at
    our existing landfills. We establish accruals for these
    estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals.
    Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase
    capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring
    our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals.

Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws
    that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste
    generated outside the state. Additionally, several state and
    local governments have enacted “flow control”
    regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated
    within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific
    sites. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation
    allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of

out-of-state

or

out-of-jurisdiction

waste or certain types of flow control or the adoption of
    legislation affecting interstate transportation of waste at the
    state level could adversely affect our operations. Courts’
    interpretation of flow control legislation or the Supreme Court
    decisions also could adversely affect our solid and hazardous
    waste management services.

The
    adoption of climate change legislation or regulations
    restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could
    increase our costs to operate.

Efforts to curtail the emission of GHGs, to ameliorate the
    effect of climate change, continue to advance on the federal,
    regional, and state level. Our landfill operations emit methane,
    identified as a GHG. In the 111th Congress, the U.S. House
    of Representatives passed a bill that would regulate GHGs
    comprehensively. While the centerpiece of that bill would be a
    GHG emission allowance

cap-and-trade

system, neither landfills nor qualifying

waste-to-energy

plants would be compelled to hold allowances for their GHG
    emissions. Rather, they would be subject to certain further
    emission controls to be determined through administrative
    rule-making. Should comprehensive federal climate change
    legislation be enacted, we expect it to impose costs on our
    operations, the materiality of which we cannot predict.

Absent comprehensive federal legislation to control GHG
    emissions, the EPA is moving ahead administratively under its
    existing Clean Air Act authority. In 2010, the EPA published a
    Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and
    Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (“PSD tailoring
    rule”). The rule sets new



thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act
    permits are required under the PSD and Title V programs.
    The EPA’s legal authority to “tailor” statutory
    thresholds in this rule has been challenged, and the EPA intends
    to delay regulation of certain emissions pending further
    regulatory analysis. We cannot predict the final requirements of
    stationary source rules that might apply to landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities as a result of this rulemaking and, accordingly,
    further developments in this area could have a material effect
    on our results of operations or cash flows.

Our
    business depends on our reputation and the value of our
    brand.

We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality
    service, reliability and social and environmental
    responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these
    attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and
    logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools,
    and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting
    them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to
    activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish
    our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our
    reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our
    services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial
    condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as
    require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and
    restore the value of our brand.

Significant
    shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will
    increase our operating expenses.

The price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based
    on international, political and economic circumstances, as well
    as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the
    Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and
    other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns,
    weather conditions and environmental concerns. We have seen
    average quarterly fuel prices increase by as much as 30% on a

year-over-year

basis and decrease by as much as 47% on a

year-over-year

basis within the last two years. We need fuel to run our
    collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our
    landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially
    increase our operating expenses. Additionally, as fuel prices
    increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our
    vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising
    costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to
    offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to
    pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’
    contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs.
    Additionally, we are currently party to a pending suit that
    pertains to our fuel and environmental charge and generally
    alleges that such charges were not properly disclosed, were
    unfair, and were contrary to contract. See Note 11 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
    Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, the increased
    operating costs will decrease our operating margins.

Some
    of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered
    financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could
    negatively impact our operating results.

We provide service to a number of governmental entities and
    municipalities, some of which have suffered significant
    financial difficulties due to the downturn in the
    U.S. economy and reduced tax revenue. Some of these
    entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew
    contracts with us at previous or increased rates. Many
    non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial
    difficulties, and the inability of our customers to pay us in a
    timely manner or to pay increased rates could negatively affect
    our operating results.

In addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could
    result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal
    bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of
    December 31, 2010, we had $611 million of tax-exempt
    bonds that are subject to re-pricing on either a daily or a
    weekly basis through a remarketing process and $405 million
    of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are
    subject to re-pricing within the next twelve months. If the
    weakness in the municipal debt market results in re-pricing of
    our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we
    will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively
    affect our operating results and cash flows.



We
    have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements,
    and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
    assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could
    negatively impact our liquidity and increase our
    liabilities.

The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for
    environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements.
    We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to
    the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are
    generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels.
    We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental
    damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to
    cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other
    insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size.
    We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling
    us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims.
    The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a
    timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation
    against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks.
    To the extent our insurers were unable to meet their
    obligations, or our own obligations for claims were more than we
    estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our
    financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with
    respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, capping, closure,
    post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we
    generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on
    insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow
    accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have
    in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our
    operations. General economic factors may adversely affect the
    cost of our current financial assurance instruments and changes
    in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of
    financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the
    event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters
    of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost,
    or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as
    adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of
    financial assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to
    deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of
    financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any
    requirements to use cash to support our obligations would
    negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could
    affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.

We may
    record material charges against our earnings due to any number
    of events that could cause impairments to our
    assets.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we
    capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to
    disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions,
    software development costs and other projects. Events that
    could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but
    are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or
    abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion
    permit. If we determine a development or expansion project is
    impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized
    capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such facility
    or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that
    we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We
    also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment
    annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering
    events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if
    we determine that events such as those described cause
    impairments. Any such charges could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations.

Our
    revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity
    prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable
    materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which
    are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The
    majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper
    fibers, including old corrugated cardboard, known as OCC, and
    old newsprint, or ONP. The fluctuations in the market prices or
    demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and
    cash flows negatively, as we experienced in 2008, or positively,
    as we experienced in 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the
    monthly market prices for OCC and ONP fell by 79% and 72%,
    respectively, from their high points within the year.
    Additionally, the decline in market prices for commodities
    resulted in a

year-over-year

decrease in revenue of $447 million in 2009. Increases in
    the prices of recycling commodities in 2010 resulted in an
    increase in revenues of $423 million as compared with 2009.
    Market prices for recyclable commodities have increased
    significantly from the near-historic lows experienced in late
    2008 and early 2009. For the twelve months of 2010, overall
    commodity



prices have increased approximately 57% as compared with 2009.
    Despite the recent positive trend in commodity prices, these
    prices may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the
    future. Additionally, our recycling operations offer rebates to
    suppliers. Therefore, even if we experience higher revenues
    based on increased market prices for commodities, the rebates we
    pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may
    be subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any
    expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor
    are eliminated.

There are also significant price fluctuations in the price of
    methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that
    are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery,

waste-to-energy

and independent power production plant operations that can
    significantly impact our revenue from yield provided by such
    businesses. In most of the markets in which we operate,
    electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices. For the
    year ended December 31, 2009, we experienced declines in
    revenue from yield at our

waste-to-energy

facilities of $76 million, due to the expiration of certain
    above-market contracts, resulting in greater exposure to market
    pricing. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, approximately 47%, 46% and 24%, respectively, of the
    electricity revenue at our

waste-to-energy

facilities was subject to current market rates. Our

waste-to-energy

facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will
    continue to increase as additional long-term contracts expire.
    We enter into “receive fixed, pay variable”
    electricity swaps to mitigate the variability in our revenues
    and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for
    electricity. These swaps are generally short-term in nature.
    Additionally, revenues from our independent power production
    plants can be affected by price fluctuations. If we are unable
    to successfully negotiate long-term contracts, or if market
    prices are at lower levels for sustained periods, our revenues
    could be adversely affected.

The
    development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal
    and

waste-to-energy

facilities could reduce our ability to operate at full capacity
    and cause our revenues and operating results to
    decline.

Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives
    to landfill and

waste-to-energy

disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working
    to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition,
    several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste
    reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain
    types of waste, such as yard and food waste, at landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities. Where such organic waste is not banned from the
    landfill or

waste-to-energy

facility, large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants
    are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills.
    Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been
    set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although
    such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment,
    these developments reduce the volume of waste going to landfills
    and

waste-to-energy

facilities in certain areas, which may affect our ability to
    operate our landfills and

waste-to-energy

facilities at full capacity, as well as affecting the prices
    that we can charge for landfill disposal and

waste-to-energy

services. Our landfills and our

waste-to-energy

facilities currently provide and have historically provided our
    highest operating margins. If we are not successful in expanding
    our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service
    waste streams that do not go to landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities and to provide services for customers that wish to
    reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results
    will decline. Additionally, despite the development of new
    service offerings and lines of business, it is reasonably
    possible that our revenues and our operating margins could be
    negatively affected due to disposal alternatives.

Our
    operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions
    organizing or changes in regulations related to labor
    unions.

Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and
    these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups
    of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we
    have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these
    unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union
    representation in the future, and, if successful, the
    negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert
    management attention and result in increased operating expenses
    and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable
    collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could
    increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including
    strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



We
    could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from
    multiemployer pension plans.

We have participated in and contributed to various
    “multiemployer” pension plans administered by employer
    and union trustees. In renegotiation of collective bargaining
    agreements with labor unions that participate in these plans, we
    may decide to discontinue participation in various plans. When
    we withdraw from plans, we can incur withdrawal liabilities for
    those plans that have underfunded pension liabilities. Various
    factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded
    status, including the numbers of retirees and active workers in
    the plan, the ongoing solvency of participating employers, the
    investment returns obtained on plan assets, and the ratio of our
    historical participation in such plan to all employers’
    historical participation. We reflect any withdrawal liability as
    an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a
    liability on our balance sheet.

We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units
    from underfunded multiemployer pension plans, and we recognized
    related expenses of $26 million in 2010, $9 million in
    2009 and $39 million in 2008. We are still negotiating and
    litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for
    these previous withdrawals, which could be materially higher
    than the charges we have recognized.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of
    our business and from

time-to-time

are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct
    of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these
    types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible
    outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse
    judgments or settlements, either of which could require
    substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.

We are
    increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if
    our technology fails, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We may experience problems with either the operation of our
    current information technology systems or the development and
    deployment of new information technology systems that could
    adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion
    of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in
    implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize
    projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, any systems
    failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report
    financial results in accordance with applicable laws and
    regulations.

If we
    are not able to develop and protect intellectual property, or if
    a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a
    breakthrough technology, our financial results may
    suffer.

Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may
    require that we develop or license, and protect, new
    technologies. We may experience difficulties or delays in the
    research, development, production

and/or

marketing of new products and services which may negatively
    impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or
    realizing a return on the investments required to bring new
    products and services to market. Further, protecting our
    intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying
    and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability
    to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services
    to customers and development of new revenue sources.
    Additionally, a competitor may develop or obtain exclusive
    rights to a “breakthrough technology” that provides a
    revolutionary change in traditional waste management. If we have
    inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial
    results may suffer.

We may
    experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations
    as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
    interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting
    rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could
    adversely affect our reported financial position or operating
    results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported
    operating results in future periods.



Our
    capital requirements could increase our expenses or cause us to
    change our growth and development plans.

Recent economic conditions have reduced our cash flows from
    operations and could do so in the future. If impacts on our cash
    flows from operations are significant, we may reduce or suspend
    capital expenditures, growth activity, dividend declarations or
    share repurchases. We may choose to incur indebtedness to pay
    for these activities, and there can be no assurances that we
    would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable.
    We also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled
    debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing
    could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses
    and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute
    our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness
    depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on
    our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon a
    number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we
    were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in
    the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability
    to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely
    affected.

Additionally, we have $1.8 billion of debt as of
    December 31, 2010 that is exposed to changes in market
    interest rates within the next twelve months because of the
    combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds, our interest rate swap
    agreements and borrowings outstanding under our Canadian Credit
    Facility. Therefore, increases in interest rates can increase
    our interest expenses which also would lower our net income and
    decrease our cash flow.

We may use our three-year, $2.0 billion revolving credit
    facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. As of
    December 31, 2010, we had $1,138 million of letters of
    credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused
    and available credit capacity of $862 million. In the event
    of a default under our credit facility, we could be required to
    immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash
    deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility
    supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally, any such
    default could cause a default under many of our other credit
    agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders
    party to those agreements, any such default would have a
    material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we
    lease approximately 435,000 square feet under leases
    expiring at various times through 2020. Our Group offices are in
    Pennsylvania, Illinois, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire. We
    also have field-based administrative offices in Arizona,
    Illinois and Texas. We own or lease real property in most
    locations where we have operations. We have operations in each
    of the fifty states other than Montana. We also have operations
    in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment consists of land (primarily
    landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and
    bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and
    equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and
    operating properties are adequately maintained and sufficient
    for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to
    make investments in additional equipment and property for
    expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with
    future acquisitions. For more information, see

Under capital allocation programs approved by our Board of
    Directors, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.27 per share
    for a total of $531 million in 2008; $0.29 per share for a
    total of $569 million in 2009; and $0.315 per share for a
    total of $604 million in 2010.

The Board of Directors approved a capital allocation program for
    2010 that provided for expenditures of up to $1.3 billion,
    comprised of approximately $615 million in cash dividends
    and up to $685 million in common stock repurchases. In
    2010, we paid $604 million in cash dividends and we
    repurchased $501 million of our common stock. All of the
    cash dividends paid and common stock repurchases in 2010 were
    made pursuant to this capital allocation program.

For each period presented, the maximum dollar value of shares

    net of the $604 million of dividends declared and paid in
    2010. The total amount available for repurchases under the
    program is shown as zero because our capital allocation program,
    by its own terms, provided for up to $1.3 billion in
    dividends and share repurchases in 2010, with any unused portion
    of the capital allocated under the program unavailable after the
    end of 2010.

In December 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors
    expects that future quarterly dividend payments will be
    increased to $0.34 per share in 2011, which is an 8% increase
    from the quarterly dividend we paid in 2010.  All quarterly
    dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of
    Directors. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved up to
    $575 million in share repurchases for 2011.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our results of operations
    for the three years ended December 31, 2010. This
    discussion may contain forward-looking statements that
    anticipate results based on management’s plans that are
    subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various
    factors that could cause actual results to differ from
    expectations in Item 1A,

Risk Factors

. The following
    discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and
    together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Overview

Our 2010 results of operations reflect our discipline in
    pricing, our ability to control costs in our collection and
    disposal operations and our continued investment in our
    strategic initiatives, which will enable us to grow into new
    markets, provide expanded service offerings and improve our
    information technology systems. Our results also reflect an
    improvement in the general economic environment. Highlights of
    our financial results for 2010 include:

•

Revenues of $12.5 billion compared with $11.8 billion
    in 2009, an increase of $724 million, or 6.1%. This
    increase in revenues is primarily attributable to:

•

Increases from recyclable commodity prices of $423 million;
    increases from our fuel surcharge program of $69 million;
    and increases from foreign currency translation of
    $66 million;

•

Increases associated with acquired businesses of
    $240 million; and

•

Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and
    disposal business of 2.3% in the current period, which increased
    revenue by $239 million;

•

Internal revenue growth from volume was negative 2.6% in 2010,
    compared with negative 8.1% in 2009. In addition to the lower
    rate of decline driven by changes in the economy, our volume was
    favorably affected by revenues associated with oil spill

clean-up

activities along the Gulf Coast. The

year-over-year

decline in internal revenue growth due to volume was
    $304 million;

•

Operating expenses of $7.8 billion, or 62.5% of revenues,
    compared with $7.2 billion, or 61.4% of revenues, in 2009.
    This increase of $583 million, or 8.1%, is due primarily to
    higher customer rebates because of recyclable commodity prices;
    higher fuel prices; increases in subcontractor costs associated
    with our oil spill

clean-up

services along the Gulf Coast; and increases in our landfill
    operating costs;

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $97 million, or 7.1%, from $1.4 billion in 2009 to
    $1.5 billion in 2010. These cost increases were primarily
    due to support of our strategic growth plans and initiatives;

•

Income from operations of $2.1 billion, or 16.9% of
    revenues, in 2010 compared with $1.9 billion, or 16.0% of
    revenues, in 2009;

•

Interest expense of $473 million compared with
    $426 million in 2009, an increase of $47 million, or
    11.0%. This increase is primarily due to higher average debt
    balances, including additional borrowings incurred in late 2009
    primarily to support our strategic plans, and higher costs
    related to the execution and maintenance of our revolving credit
    facility executed in June 2010; and

•

Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of
    $953 million, or $1.98 per diluted share for 2010, as
    compared with $994 million, or $2.01 per diluted share in
    2009.

The comparability of our 2010 results with 2009 has been
    affected by certain items management believes are not
    representative or indicative of our performance. Our 2010
    results were affected by the following:

•

The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $55 million
    related to remediation and closure costs at five closed sites,
    which had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per
    share;

•

The recognition of net tax charges of $32 million due to
    refinements in estimates of our deferred state income taxes and
    the finalization of our 2009 tax returns, partially offset by
    favorable tax audit settlements, all of which, combined, had a
    negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share;



•

The recognition of a net favorable pre-tax benefit of
    $46 million for litigation and associated costs, which had
    a favorable impact of $0.06 on our diluted earnings per
    share; and

•

The recognition of net pre-tax charges of $26 million as a
    result of the withdrawal of certain of our union bargaining
    units from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan, which had
    a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share.

Our 2009 results were affected by the following:

•

The recognition of a tax benefit of $130 million due
    principally to favorable adjustments from the carry-back of a
    capital loss, the recognition of state net operating losses and
    tax credits, the finalization of our 2008 tax returns, the
    impact of tax audit settlements and the revaluation of deferred
    taxes due to Canadian tax rate reductions. These items had a
    combined favorable impact of $0.26 on our diluted earnings per
    share;

•

The recognition of impairment charges totaling $83 million
    due primarily to the abandonment of revenue management software
    and a change in expectations for the future operations of an
    inactive landfill in California. These items had a negative
    impact of $0.10 on our diluted earnings per share; and

•

The recognition of pre-tax charges of $50 million related
    to our 2009 restructuring, primarily related to severance and
    benefit costs. These restructuring charges reduced diluted
    earnings per share for the year by $0.06.

We are pleased about the lower rate of decline in internal
    revenue growth from volumes that we experienced during 2010. On
    the pricing front, our fourth quarter 2010 results were the
    strongest of the year. For both the fourth quarter and the full
    year of 2010, we outpaced our long-term pricing objective of
    achieving price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis
    points above the consumer price index, or CPI. In 2011, we will
    remain committed to our pricing discipline. Based on an
    anticipated CPI run-rate of 1.0%, we expect our overall revenue
    growth from yield to be approximately 2.0%. Additionally, we
    expect our revenue growth from volumes to be flat to slightly
    positive. However, we are mindful of trends toward waste
    reduction at the source, diversion from landfills and customers
    seeking alternative methods of disposal. We will continue to
    implement measures that we believe will grow our business,
    improve our current operations performance and enhance and
    expand our services.

Free
    Cash Flow

As is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a
    non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use
    this measure in the evaluation and management of our business.
    We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating
    activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from
    divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other
    sales of assets. We believe it is indicative of our ability to
    pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund
    acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of
    refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is
    not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating
    activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP
    measure. However, we believe free cash flow gives investors
    useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nonetheless, the
    use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material
    limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are
    required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend
    payments and debt service requirements.

Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to
    “Net cash provided by operating activities” is shown
    in the table below (in millions), and may not be the same as
    similarly titled measures presented by other companies:

    and other sales of assets

$

$

1,211



Our free cash flow was consistent in both years, however our
    cash provided by operating activities decreased $87 million
    and our capital expenditures decreased $75 million. The
    decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily
    due to net unfavorable changes in working capital, increased
    interest payments and higher income tax payments. These
    decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by a cash
    benefit of $77 million resulting from a litigation
    settlement that occurred in April 2010. Payments made in 2009
    related to severance and benefits costs associated with our 2009
    restructuring also affected the comparability of our operating
    cash flow for the periods presented.

The decrease in capital expenditures in 2010 compared with 2009
    can generally be attributed to timing of cash payments for the
    previous years’ fourth quarter capital expenditures. We
    generally use a significant portion of our free cash flow on
    capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of each year. A less
    significant portion of our fourth quarter 2009 capital
    expenditures were paid for in cash in 2010, as compared with the
    portion of our fourth quarter 2008 capital expenditures that
    were paid for in cash in 2009.

Our ability to generate over $1.2 billion in free cash flow
    in 2010 enabled us to return $1.1 billion in cash to
    stockholders during the year through the payment of
    $604 million in dividends and the repurchase of
    $501 million of our common stock.

Basis
    of Presentation of Consolidated Financial
    Information

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

—
    In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
    issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the
    consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance
    primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an
    enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
    entity, and is, therefore, required to consolidate the entity.
    This new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as
    the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities
    of the variable interest entity that can most significantly
    impact the entity’s performance; and (ii) the
    obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits
    from the variable interest entity that could be significant from
    the perspective of the entity. The new guidance also requires
    that we continually reassess whether we are the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting
    a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events.

As a result of our implementation of this guidance, effective
    January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain capping,
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts
    because we share power over significant activities of these
    trusts with others. Our financial interests in these entities
    are discussed in Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements. The deconsolidation of these trusts has not
    materially affected our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows during the periods presented.

Business Combinations

— In December 2007, the
    FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated
    with business combinations. This guidance clarified and revised
    the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This guidance also
    addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired
    in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements
    related to business combinations. Effective January 1,
    2009, we adopted the FASB’s revised guidance associated
    with business combinations. The portions of this guidance that
    relate to business combinations completed before January 1,
    2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. Further, business combinations completed
    subsequent to January 1, 2009, which are discussed in
    Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, have not
    been material to our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows. However, to the extent that future business
    combinations are material, our adoption of the FASB’s
    revised authoritative guidance associated with business
    combinations may significantly impact our accounting and
    reporting for future acquisitions, principally as a result of
    (i) expanded requirements to value acquired assets,
    liabilities and contingencies at their fair values when such
    amounts can be determined and (ii) the requirement that
    acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be
    expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the
    cost of the acquisition.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements

— In December 2007, the FASB issued
    authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for
    the de-consolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance also
    established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
    ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be
    reported as equity in the consolidated



financial statements. We adopted this guidance on
    January 1, 2009. The presentation and disclosure
    requirements of this guidance, which must be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented, resulted in
    reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial
    information and the remeasurement of our 2008 effective tax
    rate, which is discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Fair Value Measurements

— In September 2006,
    the FASB issued authoritative guidance associated with fair
    value measurements. This guidance defined fair value,
    established a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded
    disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the
    FASB delayed the effective date of the guidance for all
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those
    that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
    Accordingly, we adopted this guidance for assets and liabilities
    recognized at fair value on a recurring basis effective
    January 1, 2008 and adopted the guidance for non-financial
    assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis
    effective January 1, 2009. The application of the fair
    value framework did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information related to the impact of the
    implementation of new accounting pronouncements on our results
    of operations and financial position.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity,
    revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and
    assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent
    on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of
    precision from data available or simply cannot be readily
    calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases,
    these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we
    must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial
    statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates
    and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of
    uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
    environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments,
    deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured
    and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in
    additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially
    from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the
    preparation of our financial statements.

Landfills

Accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and
    assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and
    develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value
    of capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement
    obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and
    timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each
    landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and
    (iv) the airspace associated with each capping event.

Landfill Costs

— We estimate the total cost to
    develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as
    landfill liner material and installation, excavation for
    airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest,

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs.
    Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases
    for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property.
    The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on
    future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill
    includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and
    capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and
    projections of future purchase and development costs.

Capping Costs

— We estimate the cost for each
    capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the
    capping materials and activities required. The estimates also
    consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in
    inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate
    landfill capping costs to specific capping events. The landfill
    capacity associated with each capping event is then quantified
    and the capping costs for each event are amortized over the
    related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed
    of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more
    often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as
    timing or cost of construction, for capping events immediately
    impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When
    the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the
    adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately



through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a
    capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment
    to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a
    component of landfill airspace amortization.

Closure and Post-Closure Costs

— We base our
    estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our
    interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for
    closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The
    estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also
    consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in
    inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal
    and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of
    these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less
    certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure
    events immediately impact the required liability and the
    corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a
    fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be
    amortized immediately through expense. When the change in
    estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully
    consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income
    prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

Expansion Airspace

— We include currently
    unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances.
    First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort,
    we must generally expect the initial expansion permit
    application to be submitted within one year, and the final
    expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we
    must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is
    likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing
    landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state
    or provincial approvals;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval of our Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 33 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2010, 14 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required
    approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or
    political opposition that could impede the expansion process.
    The remaining six landfills required approval primarily due to
    the permit application processes not meeting the one- or
    five-year requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement cost related to capping, and closure and post-closure
    of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.



Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or
    AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the
    measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is
    then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of
    settlement that is forecasted will take into account several
    site-specific factors including current and projected mix of
    waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated
    number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste,
    anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or
    recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In
    addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a
    subsequent multi- level review by our engineering group, and the
    AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as
    necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that
    the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the
    life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill
    approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and
    deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the
    corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization
    rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping
    event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities
    and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the
    future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often,
    as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of capping, closure and post-closure
    activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our
    expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be significantly
    different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that
    such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be
    significantly different than actual results, lower profitability
    may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, or higher
    expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite
    occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the
    expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating
    the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to
    recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher
    amortization expense. If it is determined that the likelihood of
    receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized
    costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental
    Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
    that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities
    include potentially responsible party (“PRP”)
    investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant
    fees, as well as costs directly associated with site
    investigation and clean up, such as materials, external
    contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related
    to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with
    environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review
    and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our
    estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of
    estimates and assumptions.

Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we
    estimate costs required to remediate sites based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.



Asset
    Impairments

Our long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill
    expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on
    their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We
    monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
    These events or changes in circumstances are referred to as
    impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we
    perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future
    cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently
    identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an
    impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can
    identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in
    excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure
    any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset
    group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined
    by considering (i) internally developed discounted
    projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group;
    (ii) actual third-party valuations;

and/or

(iii) information available regarding the current market
    for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group
    is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset
    or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is
    recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and
    is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures,
    asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash
    flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary
    from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our
    ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.

There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and
    goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess our
    goodwill for impairment. We assess whether an impairment exists
    by comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its
    carrying value, including goodwill. We use a combination of two
    valuation methods, a market approach and an income approach, to
    estimate the fair value of our operating segments. Fair value
    computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of
    factors, including projected future operating results, economic
    projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable
    marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in
    applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that these
    two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair
    value of our operating segments.

The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the
    aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar
    characteristics of our business as a multiple of their reported
    cash flows. We then apply that multiple to our operating
    segments’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We
    believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a
    fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with
    operations and economic characteristics comparable to our
    operating segments.

The income approach is based on the long-term projected future
    cash flows of our operating segments. We discount the estimated
    cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of
    capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash
    flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe
    that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair
    value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected
    long-term performance considering the economic and market
    conditions that generally affect our business.

Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim
    basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that
    would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of
    goodwill has been impaired. See Note 6 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information related to
    goodwill impairment considerations made during the reported
    periods.



Deferred
    Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the
    financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The
    deferred income tax provision represents the change during the
    reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
    Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards
    and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant
    judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of
    deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for
    uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax
    return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain
    positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When
    facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through
    our provision for income taxes.

Insured
    and Self-Insured Claims

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities
    associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated
    expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based
    on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals
    for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or
    loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used.
    Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are
    recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such
    amounts is probable.

Results
    of Operations

Operating
    Revenues

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through five
    Groups. Our four geographic Groups, comprised of our Eastern,
    Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, provide collection,
    transfer, disposal (in both solid waste and hazardous waste
    landfills) and recycling services. Our fifth Group is the
    Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to-energy

services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent
    power production plants. These five Groups are our reportable
    segments. We also provide additional services that are not
    managed through our five Groups, including recycling brokerage
    services, electronic recycling services, in-plant services,
    landfill

gas-to-energy

services and the impacts of investments that we are making in
    expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage and
    fluorescent lamp recycling. These operations are presented as
    “Other” in the table below.  Shown below (in millions)
    is the contribution to revenues during each year provided by our

Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
    collection, disposal, transfer, recycling and

waste-to-energy

services and from sales of commodities by our recycling,

waste-to-energy

and landfill

gas-to-energy

operations. Revenues from our collection operations are
    influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of
    collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the
    waste collected, distance to the MRF or disposal facility and
    our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations
    consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type
    and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal
    facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally
    based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into
    account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the
    solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally
    consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities
    to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection,
    disposal, transfer and recycling services



generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current
    market costs for fuel. Our

waste-to-energy

revenues, which are generated by our Wheelabrator Group, are
    based on the type and weight or volume of waste received at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and IPPs and amounts charged for the sale of energy
    and steam. Our “Other” revenues include our landfill

gas-to-energy

operations,

Average revenue growth for yield for “Collection and
    disposal” excludes all electricity-related revenues
    generated by our Wheelabrator Group, which are reported as
    “Electricity” revenues.

Our revenues increased $724 million, or 6.1%, and decreased
    $1,597 million, or 11.9% for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The

year-over-year

change in revenues for both periods has been driven by
    (i) market factors, including fluctuations in recyclable
    commodity prices that favorably impacted revenue growth in 2010
    and negatively affected revenue growth in 2009; volatility in
    diesel prices that affects the revenues provided by our fuel
    surcharge program, which favorably contributed to our revenues
    in 2010 and negatively affected our revenues in 2009, and
    foreign currency translation, which favorably affected revenues
    from our Canadian operations in 2010 but negatively impacted our
    revenues in 2009; (ii) revenue growth from average yield on
    our collection and disposal operations in both periods; and
    (iii) acquisitions. Further affecting revenue changes were
    revenue declines due to lower volumes that generally resulted
    from the continued weakness of the overall economic environment,
    increased pricing, competition and recent trends of waste
    reduction and diversion by consumers.

The following provides further details associated with our

period-to-period

change in revenues.

Average
    yield

Collection and disposal average yield

— This
    measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing
    activities of our collection, transfer, landfill and

waste-to-energy

disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes.



Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield
    includes not only base rate changes and environmental and
    service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price
    changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to
    both the types of services provided and the geographic locations
    where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average
    price from new and lost business; and (iii) price decreases
    to retain customers.

In both 2010 and 2009, our revenue growth from collection and
    disposal average yield demonstrates our commitment to our
    pricing strategies despite the current economic environment.
    This increase in revenue from yield was primarily driven by our
    collection operations, which experienced yield growth in all
    lines of business and in every geographic operating Group. We
    have found that increasing our yield in today’s market is a
    challenge given the reduced volume levels resulting from the
    economic slowdown. However, revenue growth from yield on base
    business and a focus on controlling variable costs have provided
    margin improvements in our collection line of business.
    Additionally, a significant portion of our collection revenues
    is generated under long-term agreements with municipalities or
    similar local or regional authorities. These agreements
    generally tie pricing adjustments to inflation indices, which
    have been low in 2010 as compared with 2009 and 2008. Despite
    this headwind, we continue to meet our pricing objective of
    achieving price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis
    points above CPI. We are committed to maintaining pricing
    discipline in order to improve yield on our base business.

Revenues from our environmental fee, which are included in
    average yield on collection and disposal, increased by
    $33 million and $37 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Environmental fee
    revenues totaled $251 million in 2010 as compared with
    $218 million in 2009 and $181 million in 2008.

Recycling commodities

— Increases in the prices
    of the recycling commodities we process resulted in an increase
    in revenues of $423 million in 2010 as compared with 2009.
    Market prices for recyclable commodities have increased
    significantly from the near-historic lows experienced in late
    2008 and early 2009. For the twelve months of 2010, overall
    commodity prices have increased approximately 57% as compared
    with 2009.

In 2009, lower recycling commodity prices were the principal
    driver of our revenue decline of $447 million. During the
    fourth quarter of 2008, we saw a rapid decline in commodity
    prices from the record-high prices we had been experiencing
    prior to the decline due to a significant decrease in the demand
    for commodities both domestically and internationally. Commodity
    demand and prices in the first nine months of 2009 remained well
    below the demand and prices in the comparable prior-year period.

business are largely due to fluctuations in rates we can receive
    for electricity under our power purchase contracts and in
    merchant transactions. In most of the markets in which we
    operate, electricity prices correlate with natural gas prices.
    We experienced declines in revenue from yield at our

waste-to-energy

facilities of $7 million and $76 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These
    declines are due to the expiration of certain above-market
    contracts, resulting in greater exposure to market pricing. In
    2010, approximately 47% of the

waste-to-energy

generation portfolio was subject to market price movements,
    compared with 46% in 2009 and 24% in 2008. Our

waste-to-energy

facilities’ exposure to market price volatility will
    continue to increase as additional long-term contracts expire;
    however, we are beginning to see an improvement in market
    pricing. In addition, we have increased our hedging activities
    to better manage this risk.

Fuel surcharges and mandated fees —

Revenue
    predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased
    by $69 million and decreased by $328 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    fluctuation is directly attributed to the fluctuation in the
    national average prices of diesel fuel that we use for our fuel
    surcharge program. The mandated fees included in this line item
    are primarily related to the pass-through to customers of fees
    and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal
    governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer stations.
    These mandated fees have not had a significant impact on the
    comparability of revenues for the periods included in the table
    above.

Volume

— Our revenue decline due to volume was
    $304 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31,
    2010. This is a notable improvement in the rate of revenue
    decline from the prior-year period when revenue decline due to
    volume was $1,078 million, or 8.1%. Volume declines are
    generally attributable to economic conditions, increased
    pricing, competition and recent trends of waste reduction and
    diversion by consumers.



In 2010, our collection business accounted for $254 million
    of the total volume-related revenue decline. We have experienced
    commercial and residential collection volume declines that we
    attribute to the overall weakness in the economy, as well as the
    effects of pricing, competition and diversion of waste by
    consumers. Our industrial collection operations continued to be
    affected by the current economic environment due to the
    construction slowdown across the United States. The overall
    volume decline in the collection line of business was offset in
    part by an increase in volumes of $99 million associated
    with oil spill

clean-up

activities along the Gulf Coast. Lower third-party volumes in
    our transfer station operations also caused revenue declines in
    the current-year period, and can generally be attributed to
    economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition.
    However, in 2010, our landfill revenues increased due to higher
    third-party volumes. This increase was principally due to higher
    special waste volumes in our Midwest and Southern geographic
    Groups, which were driven in part by our continued focus on our
    customers and better meeting their needs.

We are pleased with the lessening rate of revenue decline due to
    lower volumes. However, (i) the continued weakness of the
    overall economic environment; (ii) recent trends of waste
    reduction and diversion by consumers; and (iii) pricing and
    competition are presenting challenges to maintaining and growing
    volumes.

In 2009, our collection business accounted for $622 million
    of the total volume decline. Our industrial collection
    operations experienced the most significant revenue declines due
    to lower volumes, primarily as a result of the continued
    slowdown in both residential and commercial construction
    activities across the United States. We also experienced volume
    declines in our commercial and residential collection lines of
    businesses in 2009. We attributed these volume declines to the
    economy, although at a lesser rate than our industrial line of
    business since they are somewhat recession resistant, as well as
    to pricing and competition.

In 2009, we also experienced a 16% decline in third-party
    revenue due to volume at our landfills. This decrease was most
    significant in our more economically sensitive special waste and
    construction and demolition waste streams, although municipal
    solid waste streams at our landfills also decreased. Lower
    third-party volumes in our transfer station operations also
    caused revenue declines and can generally be attributed to
    economic conditions and the effects of pricing and competition.
    Lower volumes in our recycling operations caused declines in
    revenues of $74 million in 2009. These decreases were
    attributable to the drastic decline in the domestic and
    international demand for recyclables in late 2008.

Acquisitions and divestitures

— Revenues
    increased $240 million and $97 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to
    acquisitions, principally in (i) the collection and
    recycling lines of business in both periods, as well as our

waste-to-energy

line of business in 2010 and (ii) our “Other”
    businesses, demonstrating our current focus on identifying
    strategic growth opportunities in new, complementary lines of
    business. Divestitures accounted for decreased revenues of
    $2 million and $37 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Operating
    Expenses

Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related
    benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and
    repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages,
    bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and
    the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and
    disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party
    disposal facilities and transfer stations;
    (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment,
    vehicles and facilities and related labor costs;
    (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of
    independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to
    disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as
    volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold,
    which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with
    recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the
    costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill
    operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and
    taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees,
    host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill
    operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill
    liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments
    to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets,
    leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill
    remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk
    management costs, which include workers’ compensation and
    insurance and claim costs; and (x) other operating costs,
    which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent
    and property taxes.



Our operating expenses increased $583 million, or 8.1%,
    when comparing 2010 with 2009 and decreased by
    $1,225 million, or 14.5%, when comparing 2009 with 2008.
    Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 62.5% in
    2010, 61.4% in 2009 and 63.2% in 2008. The changes in our
    operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009 can largely be attributed to the following:

Changes in market prices for recyclable
    commodities

— Overall, market prices for
    recyclable commodities were approximately 57% higher on average
    during 2010 than in 2009. The

year-over-year

increase is the result of the recovery in recyclable commodity
    prices from the near-historic lows reached in late 2008 and
    early 2009. This increase in market prices was the driver of the
    current year increase in cost of goods sold, primarily customer
    rebates, and has also resulted in increased revenues and
    earnings this year. When comparing 2009 with 2008, market prices
    for recyclable commodities had the opposite effect on our
    results as they declined approximately 39%.

Acquisitions and growth initiatives

— In both
    2010 and 2009, we experienced cost increases attributable to
    recently acquired businesses and our various growth and business
    development initiatives. These cost increases have affected each
    of the operating cost categories identified in the table below.

Fuel price changes

— Higher market prices for
    fuel caused increases in both our direct fuel costs and our
    subcontractor costs for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    while lower market prices caused decreases in these costs for
    the year ended December 31, 2009. On average, diesel fuel
    prices increased 21%, to $2.99 per gallon for 2010 from $2.46
    per gallon for 2009; while they decreased in 2009 by 35%, from
    $3.81 per gallon in 2008.

Canadian exchange rates

— When comparing the
    average exchange rate for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10%, which
    increased our expenses in all operating cost categories. The
    strengthening of the Canadian dollar increased our total
    operating expenses by $52 million for 2010 as compared with
    2009. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the Canadian exchange rate
    weakened by 7% and decreased our total operating expenses by
    $40 million.

Volume declines and divestitures

— Throughout
    2010 and 2009, we experienced volume declines as a result of the
    continued weakness of the overall economic environment, pricing,
    competition and recent trends of waste reduction and diversion
    by consumers. Note that the revenue decline due to lower volume
    moderated in 2010 as compared with the volume decline in 2009,
    particularly in the second half of the year. During 2009 we also
    experienced volume declines as a result of divestitures. We
    continue to manage our fixed costs and reduce our variable costs
    as we experience volume declines, and have achieved significant
    cost savings as a result. These cost decreases have benefited
    each of the operating cost categories identified in the table
    below.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
    operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency
    translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in
    millions):

The

period-to-period

changes for each category of operating expenses are discussed
    below.

Labor and related benefits

— Our 2010 expenses
    increased as a result of (i) higher salaries and wages due
    to merit increases that were effective in July 2009 for hourly
    employees and in April 2010 for both salaried and hourly
    employees; (ii) additional expenses incurred for
    acquisitions and growth opportunities; and (iii) the
    strengthening of the Canadian dollar. These cost increases were
    offset, in part, by cost savings that have been achieved as
    volumes declined.

When comparing 2009 with 2008, the cost declines were generally
    a result of (i) headcount and overtime reductions related
    to volume declines; (ii) effects of foreign currency
    translation; (iii) a benefit from the restructuring we
    initiated in January of 2009, although most of these savings
    were reflected in our selling, general and administrative
    expenses; and (iv) cost savings provided by our operational
    improvement initiatives. These cost savings were offset, in
    part, by higher hourly wages due to merit increases and
    increased bonus expense as our performance against targets
    established by our incentive plans was stronger than it had been
    in 2008.

The comparability of our labor and related benefits costs for
    the periods presented has also been affected by costs incurred
    primarily associated with the withdrawal of certain bargaining
    units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans. These costs
    increased 2010 expense by $26 million, 2009 expense by
    $9 million and 2008 expense by $42 million.

Transfer and disposal costs —

During 2009 the
    cost decreases as compared with 2008 were a result of volume
    declines and our continued focus on reducing disposal costs
    associated with our third-party disposal volumes by improving
    internalization. This decrease was also partially due to foreign
    currency translation.

Maintenance and repairs —

Comparing 2009 with
    2008, these costs declined as a result of volume declines and
    various fleet initiatives that favorably affected our
    maintenance, parts and supplies costs. These decreases were
    offset partially by cost increases due to differences in the
    timing and scope of planned maintenance projects at our

waste-to-energy

and landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities.

Subcontractor costs

— The 2010 increase in
    subcontractor costs is largely the result of oil spill

clean-up

activities along the Gulf Coast and is also attributable to
    higher diesel fuel prices. We incurred $54 million in
    subcontractor costs related to oil spill

clean-up

activities this year. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the cost
    decreases are a result of volume declines, a significant
    decrease in diesel fuel prices and the effects of foreign
    currency translation.

Cost of goods sold —

The cost changes during
    the years presented are principally due to changes in the
    recycling commodity rebates we pay to our customers as a result
    of changes in market prices for recyclable commodities.

Fuel —

The cost changes for 2010 and 2009 are a
    result of changes in market prices for diesel fuel and volume
    declines.

Disposal and franchise fees and taxes —

These
    cost decreases in 2009 as compared with 2008 are principally a
    result of volume declines.

Landfill operating costs

— Increases in these
    costs in the current year were due, in part, to the recognition
    of additional estimated expense associated with environmental
    remediation liabilities of $50 million at four closed sites
    during 2010.

The changes in this category for the years presented were also
    significantly impacted by the changes in U.S. Treasury
    rates used to estimate the present value of our environmental
    remediation obligations and recovery assets. As a result of
    changes in U.S. Treasury rates, we recognized
    $2 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2010, compared
    with $35 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 and
    $33 million of unfavorable adjustments during 2008. Over
    the course of 2010, the discount rate we use decreased slightly
    from 3.75% to 3.50%, although it reached as low as 2.50% in
    September. During 2009, the rate increased from 2.25% to 3.75%
    and during 2008, the rate declined from 4.00% to 2.25%.



Risk management —

The slight

year-over-year

decrease in 2010 and the consistent cost levels in 2009 and 2008
    reflect the success we have had over the last several years in
    managing these costs, which can be credited primarily to our
    continued focus on safety and reduced accident and injury rates.

Other —

The comparison of these costs has been
    significantly affected by the following:

•

In 2010, the increase in costs compared with 2009 was
    attributable, in part, to (i) our various growth and
    business development initiatives, (ii) oil spill

clean-up

activities along the Gulf Coast, and (iii) recently
    acquired businesses. These cost increases were partially offset
    by an increase in gains recognized from the sale of surplus real
    estate assets.

•

In 2009, we had a significant increase in the property taxes
    assessed for one of our

waste-to-energy

facilities.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
    (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include
    salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract
    labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation;
    (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting,
    legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad
    debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer
    accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other selling,
    general and administrative expenses, which include, among other
    costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data
    telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment,
    rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial
    impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our
    “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $97 million, or 7.1%, when comparing 2010 with 2009 and
    decreased $113 million, or 7.7%, when comparing 2009 with
    2008. The current year increase is largely due to
    (i) increased costs of $52 million during 2010,
    incurred to support our strategic plan to grow into new markets
    and provide expanded service offerings and (ii) increased
    costs of $23 million during 2010, resulting from
    improvements we are making to our information technology
    systems. When comparing 2009 with 2008, the decrease was due in
    part to (i) the realization of benefits associated with our
    January 2009 restructuring and (ii) increased efforts to
    reduce controllable spending. Our selling, general and
    administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 11.7%
    in 2010, 11.6% in 2009 and 11.0% in 2008.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
    selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended
    December 31 (dollars in millions):

Labor and related benefits

— In 2010, our labor
    and related benefits costs increased due primarily to
    (i) higher salaries and hourly wages due to merit
    increases; (ii) higher compensation costs due to an
    increase in headcount driven by our growth initiatives;
    (iii) additional bonus expense in 2010 because our
    performance against targets established by our annual incentive
    plans was stronger in 2010 compared with 2009;
    (iv) increased contract labor costs as a result of our
    current focus on optimizing our information technology systems;
    (v) increased severance costs; and (vi) higher
    non-cash compensation costs incurred for equity awards granted
    under our long-term incentive plans. During the second quarter
    of 2009, we reversed all compensation costs previously
    recognized for our 2008 performance share units based on a
    determination that it was no longer probable that the targets
    established for that award would be met. Additionally, stock
    option equity awards granted during the first quarter of 2010
    provide for continued vesting for three years following an
    employee’s retirement, and because retirement-eligible
    employees are not required to provide any future service to vest
    in these awards, we recognized all of the compensation expense
    associated with their awards immediately. We did not incur
    similar charges in prior years because this retirement provision
    was not included in any of the equity awards that were granted
    in 2009 or in 2008.



In 2009, our labor and related benefits costs decreased from
    2008 because we realized benefits associated with our January
    2009 restructuring. Our labor and related benefits expenses in
    2009 were also affected by a significant decrease in non-cash
    compensation costs associated with the equity-based compensation
    provided for by our long-term incentive plans as a result of
    (i) a decline in the grant-date fair value of our equity
    awards; (ii) lower performance against established targets
    for certain awards than in the prior year; and (iii) the
    reversal of all compensation costs previously recognized for our
    2008 performance share units. This decrease in non-cash
    compensation costs was offset, in part, by higher costs
    associated with our salary deferral plan, the costs of which are
    directly affected by equity-market conditions. Additionally,
    contract labor costs incurred for various Corporate support
    functions were lower during 2009 than in 2008.

Professional fees

— In 2010, our professional
    fees increased due to consulting fees, driven primarily by
    improvements we are making to our information technology systems
    and our continued strategic focus to grow into new markets and
    provide expanded service offerings. This increase was partially
    offset by a reduction in legal fees in 2010.

Provision for bad debts

— Our provision for bad
    debts was higher in 2009 and in 2008 as compared with 2010 as a
    result of the Company’s assessment of the weak economic
    environment in those years and the resulting impacts on our
    collection risk. However, in the latter part of 2009 and during
    2010 our collection risk moderated, thus resulting in a lower
    provision in 2010.

Other

— During 2010, we experienced increases
    in our (i) litigation reserves, (ii) marketing and
    advertising costs, due in part to our strategic plan to grow
    into new markets and provide expanded service offerings, and
    (iii) computer costs, due in part to improvements we are
    making to our information technology systems.

In 2009, our focus on reducing controllable spending resulted in
    decreases in our advertising, meetings, seminars, and travel and
    entertainment costs. These lower costs were partially due to the
    January 2009 restructuring. This decline was offset partially by
    unfavorable litigation settlements in 2009.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of
    property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital
    leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years;
    (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those
    incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill
    development, construction and asset retirement costs arising
    from closure and post-closure, on a

units-of-consumption

method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated
    remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted
    capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific
    criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of
    landfill asset retirement costs arising from capping obligations
    on a

units-of-consumption

method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity
    associated with each capping event; and (iv) amortization
    of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150%
    declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the
    definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally
    from two to ten years depending on the type of asset.

The following table summarizes the components of our
    depreciation and amortization costs for the years ended December
    31 (dollars in millions):

The increase in amortization expense of landfill airspace in
    2010 is largely due to adjustments to the amortization rates at
    various landfill sites. These adjustments were principally
    attributable to increases in cost estimates. The decrease in
    amortization of landfill airspace expense in 2009 is largely due
    to volume declines as a



result of (i) the slowdown in the economy; (ii) our
    pricing strategy and competition, both of which significantly
    reduced our collection volumes; and (iii) the re-direction
    of waste to third-party disposal facilities in certain regions
    due to either the closure of our own landfills or the current
    capacity constraints of landfills where we are seeking an
    expansion permit. The comparability of our amortization of
    landfill airspace for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008 has also been affected by adjustments recorded in
    each year for changes in estimates related to our capping,
    closure and post-closure obligations. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, landfill amortization
    expense was reduced by $13 million, $14 million and
    $3 million, respectively, for the effects of these changes
    in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense
    resulting from the revised estimates was associated with capping
    changes that were generally the result of (i) concerted
    efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills
    and volume declines, both of which have allowed us to delay
    spending for capping activities; (ii) effectively managing
    the cost of capping material and construction; or
    (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or
    deferred capping costs.

The increase in amortization expense of intangible assets in
    2010 is due to our focus on the growth and development of our
    business through acquisitions and other investments. The current
    year increases are primarily related to the amortization of
    definite-lived operating permits acquired by our healthcare
    solutions operations, customer lists acquired by our Southern
    and Midwest Groups and gas rights acquired by our renewable
    energy operations.

Restructuring

In January 2009, we took steps to further streamline our
    organization by (i) consolidating our Market Areas;
    (ii) integrating the management of our recycling operations
    with our other solid waste business; and (iii) realigning
    our Corporate organization with this new structure in order to
    provide support functions more efficiently.

Our principal operations are managed through our Groups. Each of
    our four geographic Groups had been further divided into 45
    Market Areas. As a result of our restructuring, the Market Areas
    were consolidated into 25 Areas. We found that our larger
    Market Areas generally were able to achieve efficiencies through
    economies of scale that were not present in our smaller Market
    Areas, and this reorganization has allowed us to lower costs and
    to continue to standardize processes and improve productivity.
    In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, responsibility
    for the oversight of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities was transferred from our Waste
    Management Recycle America, or WMRA, organization to our four
    geographic Groups. By integrating the management of our
    recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste
    business, we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive
    environmental solutions to our customers. In addition, as a
    result of this realignment, we have significantly reduced the
    overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our
    business and have increased the geographic Groups’ focus on
    maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of
    our business on an integrated basis.

This restructuring eliminated over 1,500 employee positions
    throughout the Company. During 2009, we recognized
    $50 million of pre-tax charges associated with this
    restructuring, of which $41 million were related to
    employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were
    primarily related to lease obligations for property that will no
    longer be utilized.

In 2010, we recognized $2 million of income related to the
    reversal of pre-tax restructuring charges.

Income from Divestitures

— The net gain from
    divestitures during 2008 was a result of our focus on selling
    underperforming businesses and primarily related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our
    Southern Group.

Asset Impairments

— Through December 31,
    2008, we capitalized $70 million of accumulated costs
    associated with the development of a new waste and recycling
    revenue management system. A significant portion of these costs
    was specifically associated with the purchase of a license for
    waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts
    required to develop and configure that software for our use.
    After a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of
    our smallest Market Areas, the development efforts associated
    with the revenue management system were suspended in 2007.
    During 2009, we determined to enhance and improve our existing
    revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated
    with the development and implementation of the licensed
    software. Accordingly, in 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge
    of $51 million, $49 million of which was recognized
    during the first quarter of 2009 and $2 million of which
    was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2009, for the
    abandonment of the licensed software.

We recognized an additional $32 million of impairment
    charges during 2009, $27 million of which was recognized by
    our Western Group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully
    impair a landfill in California as a result of a change in our
    expectations for the future operations of the landfill. The
    remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a
    charge required to write down certain of our investments in
    portable self-storage operations to their fair value as a result
    of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those
    operations.

During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge,
    primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our
    Southern Group.

Other

— We filed a lawsuit in March 2008
    related to the revenue management software implementation that
    was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009. In April 2010, we
    settled the lawsuit and received a one-time cash payment. The
    settlement resulted in an increase in income from operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 of $77 million.

Reportable Segments —

The most significant
    items affecting the results of operations of our four geographic
    Groups during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010
    are summarized below:

•

revenue growth from yield on our base business;

•

market prices for recyclable commodities reflected significant
    improvement

year-over-year

during 2010 and a sharp decline during 2009 as compared with
    2008;

•

the accretive benefits of recent acquisitions, in particular
    during 2010 and to a lesser extent during 2009;

•

continued volume declines due to economic conditions, increased
    pricing, competition and recent trends of waste reduction and
    waste diversion by consumers;

•

increasing direct and indirect costs for diesel fuel, which
    outpaced the related revenue growth from our fuel surcharge
    program in both 2010 and 2009, although a portion of the 2010
    shortfall was reduced during the fourth quarter due, in part, to
    changes we made in our fuel surcharge program; and

•

higher salaries and wages due to annual merit increases that
    were effective in July 2009 for hourly employees and in April
    2010 for both salaried and hourly employees.

The comparability of each of our geographic Groups’
    operating results for the periods was also affected by the
    restructuring charges recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Other significant items affecting the comparability of our
    Groups’ results of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized below:

Eastern

— During 2009, the Group recognized
    (i) an $18 million increase in revenues and income
    from operations associated with an oil and gas lease at one of
    our landfills; and (ii) a $9 million charge related to
    bargaining unit employees in New Jersey agreeing to our proposal
    to withdraw them from an underfunded multiemployer pension fund.

During 2008, the Group’s operating income was negatively
    affected by a $14 million charge related to the withdrawal
    of certain collective bargaining units from underfunded
    multiemployer pension plans.

Midwest

— The income from operations of our
    Midwest Group for 2010 was significantly affected by the
    recognition of charges of $26 million as a result of
    employees of five bargaining units in Michigan and Ohio agreeing
    to our proposal to withdraw them from an underfunded
    multiemployer pension plan.



The Group’s 2008 operating results were negatively affected
    by $44 million of additional operating expenses primarily
    incurred as a result of a labor dispute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
    Included in the labor dispute expenses were $32 million in
    charges related to the withdrawal of certain of the Group’s
    bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans.

Additionally, when comparing the average exchange rate for 2010
    with 2009, the Canadian exchange rate strengthened by 10%, which
    increased the Group’s income from operations. When
    comparing the average exchange rate for 2009 with 2008, the
    Canadian exchange rate weakened by 7%, which decreased the
    Group’s income from operations. The effects of foreign
    currency translation were the most significant to this Group
    because substantially all of our Canadian operations are managed
    by our Midwest Group.

Southern

— Additional volumes from oil spill

clean-up

activities along the Gulf Coast and lower repair and maintenance
    costs favorably impacted the Group’s 2010 income from
    operations.

During 2008, the Group’s operating income was favorably
    affected by $29 million of divestiture gains, offset, in
    part, by a $3 million landfill impairment charge. Also
    favorably affecting the comparison of the Group’s results
    in 2009 as compared with 2008 was the recognition of
    $9 million of favorable adjustments during 2009 resulting
    from changes in estimates associated with our obligations for
    landfill capping, closure and post-closure. Similar favorable
    adjustments impacted the Group’s results during 2010.

Western

— The Group’s 2010 income from
    operations includes $12 million of additional
    “Selling, general and administrative” expense
    recognized as a result of a litigation settlement.

The Group’s 2009 income from operations includes the
    recognition of an impairment charge of $27 million as a
    result of a change in expectations for the future operations of
    an inactive landfill in California.

Further affecting the comparison of 2010 results with 2009 was
    the recognition of $7 million of favorable adjustments to
    landfill amortization expense during 2010 associated with our
    obligations for landfill capping, closure and post-closure, and
    a net $5 million of expense recognized for adjustments
    related to these obligations during 2009. The unfavorable
    adjustments during 2009 primarily related to a closed landfill
    in Los Angeles, California for which the Group recognized
    additional amortization expense. The additional expense in 2009
    did not affect the comparison to 2008 because, during 2008, we
    recognized an unfavorable adjustment at the same landfill which
    was of a similar magnitude.

Wheelabrator

— The decrease in the income from
    operations of our Wheelabrator Group for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 was driven by an
    increase in maintenance-related outages as compared with the
    prior year, which resulted in decreased electricity generation
    and increased plant maintenance costs. These increases are
    attributable to the acceleration of repair and maintenance
    expenses at our facility in Portsmouth, Virginia that we
    acquired in April 2010, and expenses at certain of our other
    facilities. The Group also experienced an increase in litigation
    settlement costs as compared with 2009. These unfavorable items
    were partially offset by the benefit of increased revenues from
    the sale of metals.

The comparability of the Group’s 2009 income from
    operations with 2008 was significantly affected by (i) a
    decline in market prices for electricity, which had a
    significant impact on the Group’s results in 2009 due to
    the expiration of several long-term energy contracts and
    short-term pricing arrangements; (ii) an increase in costs
    for international and domestic business development activities;
    and (iii) an increase in “Operating” expenses of
    $11 million as a result of a significant increase in the
    property taxes assessed for one of our

waste-to-energy

facilities. Exposure to current electricity market prices
    increased from 24% of total electricity production in 2008 to
    46% in 2009.

Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining
    components of our results of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized below:

Other

— Our “Other” income from
    operations includes (i) the effects of those elements of
    our in-plant services, landfill

gas-to-energy

operations, and third-party subcontract and administration
    revenues managed by our
    Upstream

®

,

    Renewable Energy and Strategic Accounts organizations,
    respectively, that are not included with the operations of our
    reportable segments; (ii) our recycling and electronic
    recycling brokerage services; and (iii) the impacts of
    investments that we are making in expanded service offerings
    such as portable



self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling. In addition, our
    “Other” income from operations reflects the impacts of
    non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and
    self-insurance support for the Groups or financing for our
    Canadian operations and also includes certain year-end
    adjustments recorded in consolidation related to the reportable
    segments that were not included in the measure of segment profit
    or loss used to assess their performance for the periods
    disclosed.

The slight improvement in operating results for our
    “Other” businesses during 2010 as compared with 2009
    is due to improvements in our recycling brokerage business as a
    result of higher recycling commodity prices this year, largely
    offset by the unfavorable effects of (i) additional costs
    in the current year to support the Company’s strategic plan
    to grow into new markets and provide expanded service offerings
    and (ii) certain year-end adjustments recorded in
    consolidation related to our reportable segments that were not
    included in the measure of segment income from operations used
    to assess their performance for the periods disclosed. For 2010,
    the adjustments were primarily related to $15 million of
    additional expense recognized for litigation reserves and
    associated costs in the Southern and Wheelabrator Groups.

The unfavorable change in 2009 operating results compared with
    2008 is largely due to (i) the effect that the previously
    discussed lower recycling commodity prices had on our recycling
    brokerage activities; (ii) an increase in costs incurred to
    support the identification and development of new lines of
    business that will complement our core business; (iii) the
    unfavorable impact lower energy prices during 2009 had on our
    landfill-gas-to-energy operations; and (iv) certain
    year-end adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our
    reportable segments that were not included in the measure of
    segment income from operations used to assess their performance
    for the periods disclosed.

Corporate and Other

— Significant items
    affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods
    presented include:

•

a benefit of $128 million when comparing 2010 with 2009
    associated with the revenue management software implementation
    that was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009, comprised of
    (i) a current year benefit of $77 million resulting
    from a one-time cash payment from a litigation settlement that
    occurred in April 2010 and (ii) $51 million in charges
    recognized during 2009 for the abandonment of the licensed
    software;

•

the recognition of net charges of $50 million during 2010
    for estimates associated with environmental remediation
    liabilities at four closed sites;

•

the recognition of $34 million of favorable adjustments
    during 2009 by our closed sites management group due to
    increases in U.S. Treasury rates used to estimate the
    present value of our environmental remediation obligations and
    environmental remediation recovery assets, while in 2010 and
    2008 the same group recognized charges to landfill operating
    costs of $2 million and $32 million, respectively, due
    to declines in U.S. Treasury rates during those periods;

•

the recognition of $9 million in restructuring charges
    during 2009;

•

a significant increase in “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses during 2010 as result of cost
    increases related to our equity compensation, consulting fees,
    bonus expense, annual salary and wage increases and headcount
    increases to support the Company’s strategic initiatives;
    partially offset by a favorable litigation settlement during the
    third quarter of 2010; and

•

a significant decline in “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses in 2009 as compared with 2008
    resulting from workforce reductions associated with the January
    2009 restructuring, increased efforts to reduce our controllable
    spending and lower equity compensation costs.

Renewable
    Energy Operations

We have extracted value from the waste streams we manage for
    years, and we are focusing on increasing our ability to do so,
    particularly in the field of clean and renewable energy. Most
    significantly, our current operations produce renewable energy
    through the

waste-to-energy

facilities that are managed by our Wheelabrator Group and our
    landfill

gas-to-energy

operations. We are actively seeking opportunities to enhance our
    existing renewable



energy service offerings to ensure that we can respond to the
    shifting demands of consumers and to ensure that we are acting
    as a leader in environmental stewardship.

We are disclosing the following supplemental information related
    to the operating results of our renewable energy operations for
    2010 (in millions) because we believe that it provides
    information related to the significance of our current renewable
    energy operations, the profitability of these operations and the
    costs we are incurring to develop these operations:

technologies; and other engineered fuels technologies. The
    operating results of our Growth Opportunities are included
    within “Other” in our assessment of our income from
    operations by segment.

Interest
    Expense

Our interest expense was $473 million in 2010,
    $426 million in 2009 and $455 million in 2008. When
    comparing 2010 with 2009, the significant increase in our
    interest expense is primarily due to (i) the issuance of an
    additional $600 million of senior notes in November 2009 to
    support acquisitions and investments made throughout 2010,
    (ii) significantly higher costs related to the execution
    and maintenance of our revolving credit facility, which was
    refinanced in June 2010, and (iii) a decrease in benefits
    to interest expense provided by active interest rate swaps as a
    result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps outstanding.
    These increases in interest expense were offset, in part, by a
    decline in market interest rates, which has reduced the interest
    costs of our tax-exempt borrowings and our Canadian credit
    facility.

When comparing 2009 with 2008, the decrease in interest expense
    was primarily due to declines in market interest rates, which
    increased the benefits to interest expense provided by our
    active interest rate swap agreements and reduced the interest
    expense associated with our tax-exempt bonds and our Canadian
    credit facility.

Interest
    income

Interest income was $4 million in 2010, $13 million in
    2009 and $19 million in 2008. The decreases in interest
    income are primarily related to a decline in market interest
    rates. Although our average cash and cash equivalents balances
    increased each year, near-historic low short-term interest rates
    have resulted in insignificant interest income being generated
    on current balances.



Equity
    in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities

During 2010, our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated
    entities” was primarily related to our noncontrolling
    interest in a limited liability company established to invest in
    and manage low-income housing properties. The equity losses
    generated by the limited liability company were more than offset
    by tax benefits realized as a result of this investment as
    discussed below in

Provision for Income Taxes.

Refer to
    Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
    information related to our federal low-income housing investment.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

We recorded provisions for income taxes of $629 million in
    2010, $413 million in 2009 and $669 million in 2008.
    These tax provisions resulted in an effective income tax rate of
    approximately 38.5%, 28.1%, and 37.2% for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is
    primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before
    income taxes; (ii) the utilization of a capital loss
    carry-back; (iii) the realization of state net operating
    loss and credit carry-forwards; (iv) changes in effective
    state and Canadian statutory tax rates; (v) tax audit
    settlements; and (vi) the impact of federal low-income
    housing tax credits. The impacts of these items are summarized
    below:

•

C

apital Loss Carry-back

— During 2009, we
    generated a capital loss from the liquidation of a foreign
    subsidiary. We determined that the capital loss could be
    utilized to offset capital gains from 2006 and 2007, which
    resulted in a reduction to our 2009 “Provision for income
    taxes” of $65 million.

•

State Net Operating Loss and Credit Carry-forwards

— During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we released state
    net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a
    reduction to our “Provision for income taxes” for
    those periods of $4 million, $35 million and
    $3 million, respectively.

•

Canadian and State Tax Rate Changes

— During
    2009, the provincial tax rates in Ontario were reduced, which
    resulted in a $13 million tax benefit as a result of the
    revaluation of the related deferred tax balances.

During 2010, our current state tax rate increased from 6.25% to
    6.75% resulting in an increase to our provision for income taxes
    of $5 million. In addition, our state deferred income taxes
    increased $37 million to reflect the impact of changes in
    the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences
    will be realized. During 2009, our current state tax rate
    increased from 6.0% to 6.25% and our deferred state tax rate
    increased from 5.5% to 5.75%, resulting in an increase to our
    income taxes of $3 million and $6 million,
    respectively. During 2008, our current state tax rate increased
    from 5.5% to 6.0%, resulting in an increase to our income taxes
    of $5 million. The increases in these rates are primarily
    due to changes in state law. The comparison of our effective
    state tax rate during the reported periods has also been
    affected by

return-to-accrual

adjustments, which increased our “Provision for income
    taxes” in 2010 and reduced our “Provision for income
    taxes” in 2009 and 2008.

•

Tax Audit Settlements

— The settlement of
    various tax audits resulted in reductions in income tax expense
    of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

•

Federal Low-income Housing Tax Credits

— Our
    federal low-income housing investment and the resulting credits
    reduced our provision for income taxes by $26 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 9 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information
    related to our federal low-income housing investment.

We expect our 2011 recurring effective tax rate will be
    approximately 35.7% based on expected income levels and
    additional Section 45 tax credits resulting from our
    investment in a refined coal facility. Specifically, in January
    2011, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited
    liability company established to invest in and manage a refined
    coal facility. The facility’s refinement processes qualify
    for federal tax credits which we expect to realize through 2019
    in accordance with Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Small Business Jobs Act, signed into law in September 2010,
    contains a tax incentive package that includes a one-year
    extension through 2010 of the 50 percent bonus, or
    accelerated, depreciation provision first enacted in 2008 and
    subsequently renewed in 2009. The provision had expired at the
    end of 2009. Under the bonus depreciation provision,
    50 percent of the basis of qualified capital expenditures
    may be deducted in the year the



property is placed in service and the remaining 50 percent
    deducted under normal depreciation rules. The acceleration of
    deductions on 2010 capital expenditures resulting from the bonus
    depreciation provision had no impact on our effective tax rate.
    However, the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions did
    decrease our 2010 cash taxes by $60 million. Taking the
    accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes
    in future periods when the accelerated deductions for these
    capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken.

In addition, new tax law signed on December 17, 2010
    includes an extension of the bonus depreciation allowance
    through the end of 2011, and increases the amount of qualifying
    capital expenditures that can be depreciated immediately from
    50 percent to 100 percent. The 100 percent
    depreciation deduction applies to qualifying property placed in
    service between September 8, 2010 and December 31,
    2011. The passage of the extension of bonus depreciation is
    estimated to decrease our 2011 cash taxes by approximately
    $190 million. The cash tax benefit realized in 2011 will
    result in increased cash taxes in future periods when the
    deduction for these capital expenditures would have otherwise
    been realized.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was
    $49 million in 2010, $66 million in 2009 and
    $41 million in 2008. In each period, these amounts have
    been principally related to third parties’ equity interests
    in two limited liability companies that own three

waste-to-energy

facilities operated by our Wheelabrator Group. However the
    comparison of these amounts for the reported periods has been
    affected by (i) our January 2010 acquisition of a
    controlling financial interest in a portable self-storage
    business and (ii) the deconsolidation of certain capping,
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts as a
    result of our implementation of authoritative accounting
    guidance, effective January 1, 2010, associated with
    variable interest entities.

Landfill
    and Environmental Remediation Discussion and
    Analysis

We owned or operated 266 solid waste and five secure hazardous
    waste landfills at December 31, 2010 and we owned or
    operated 268 solid waste and five hazardous waste landfills at
    December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste
    that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is
    shown below (in millions):

Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31,
    2010 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average
    remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated
    landfills is approximately 40 years. Many of our landfills
    have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is
    currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted
    disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether
    to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated
    future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking
    expansion permits at 33 of our landfills that meet the expansion
    criteria outlined in the

Critical Accounting Estimates and
    Assumptions

section above. Although no assurances can be
    made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted
    as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for
    all owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years
    when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume.



The number of landfills we own or operate as of
    December 31, 2010, segregated by their estimated operating
    lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:

(a)

From an operating perspective, landfills we operate through
    lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own
    the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the
    landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the
    life of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills
    we lease.

(b)

For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and
    we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the
    life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations under the
    operating contracts.

The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace
    changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or

These amounts include 1.7 million tons at December 31,
    2010 and 1.5 million tons at December 31, 2009 that
    were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial
    purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted
    airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are
    frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for
    composting and clean dirt for

on-site

construction projects.

When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of
    closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally
    transfer the management of the site, including any remediation
    activities, to our closed sites management group. As of
    December 31, 2010, our closed sites management group
    managed 202 closed landfills.

Landfill Assets

— We capitalize various costs
    that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs
    generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill
    footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting,
    excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate
    collection systems, landfill gas collection systems,
    environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill
    gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future
    costs associated with landfill capping, closure and post-closure
    activities, which are discussed further below.

The following table reflects the total cost basis of our
    landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and summarizes
    significant changes in these amounts during 2010 (in millions):

As of December 31, 2010, we estimate that we will spend
    approximately $400 million in 2011, and approximately
    $1 billion in 2012 and 2013 combined for the construction
    and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of
    landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and
    spending estimates are subject to



change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in
    environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill
    operations.

Landfill and Environmental Remediation
    Liabilities

— As we accept waste at our landfills,
    we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include
    liabilities associated with landfill capping, closure and
    post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in
    accordance with authoritative guidance associated with
    accounting for asset retirement obligations, and are discussed
    in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also
    have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have
    incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by
    operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed
    before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize
    environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the
    liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely
    remedy can be reasonably estimated.

The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our
    environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and summarizes significant changes in these
    amounts during 2010 (in millions):

Landfill Costs and Expenses

— As disclosed in
    the

Operating Expenses

section above, our landfill
    operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement
    obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments
    to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets,
    leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill
    remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following
    table summarizes these costs for each of the three years
    indicated (in millions):

$


$


The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been
    significantly affected by accounting for changes in the
    risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present
    value of our environmental remediation liabilities and
    environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the
    rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the
    weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying
    obligations. Additionally, in 2010, we increased our cost
    estimates associated with environmental remediation obligations
    primarily based on a review and evaluation of existing
    remediation projects. As these remediation projects progressed,
    more defined reclamation plans were developed, resulting in an
    increase in remediation expense to reflect the more likely
    remedies.



Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a
    component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense,
    includes the following:

•

the amortization of landfill capital costs, including
    (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and
    (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and
    construction required to develop our landfills to their
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and

•

the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill
    capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including
    (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and
    (ii) projected asset retirement costs.

Amortization expense is recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is
    calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis
    of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the
    corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and
    closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally
    incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its
    entire operating life, and are, therefore, amortized on a
    per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity.
    Capping asset retirement costs are attributed to a specific
    capping event, and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis
    using each discrete capping event’s estimated airspace
    capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton
    amortization rates.

The following table calculates our landfill airspace
    amortization expense on a per-ton basis:

Years Ended December 31,

$


$

Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)




Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton

$

4.08

$

3.90

$

4.01

Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our
    271 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary
    significantly from one landfill to another due to
    (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs
    and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for
    landfill development and landfill capping, closure and
    post-closure activities; and (ii) differences in the cost
    basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire.
    Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured
    on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of
    volumes we receive across the Company

year-over-year.

The comparability of our total Company average landfill airspace
    amortization expense per ton for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 has also been affected by
    the recognition of reductions to amortization expense for
    changes in our estimates related to our capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations. Landfill amortization expense was
    reduced by $13 million in 2010, $14 million in 2009
    and $3 million in 2008, for the effects of these changes in
    estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense
    resulted from revisions in the estimated timing or cost of
    capping events that were generally the result of
    (i) concerted efforts to improve the operating efficiencies
    of our landfills and volume declines, both of which have allowed
    us to delay spending for capping activities;
    (ii) effectively managing the cost of capping material and
    construction; or (iii) landfill expansions that resulted in
    reduced or deferred capping costs.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our
    liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our
    present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may
    arise during the year as a result of changing business
    conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working
    capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
    ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
    construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
    to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment;
    (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at

waste-to-energy

and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and
    equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and
    post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the
    repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations; and
    (vii) investments and acquisitions that we believe will be
    accretive and provide continued growth in our business. We also
    are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on
    their investment through our capital allocation program that
    provides for dividend payments and share repurchases.

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money
    market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations
    with original maturities of three months or less. The

year-over-year

decrease in our cash balances is largely attributable to our
    November 2009 senior note issuance. We used a significant
    portion of the proceeds of this debt issuance to fund
    investments and acquisitions during the first half of 2010,
    including (i) our acquisition of a

waste-to-energy

facility in Portsmouth, Virginia for $150 million and
    (ii) our purchase of a 40% equity investment in SEG, a
    subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co., Ltd., for
    $142 million. Pending application of the offering proceeds
    as described, we temporarily invested the proceeds in money
    market funds, which were reflected as cash equivalents in our
    December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

—
    Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of
    (i) funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill
    capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation
    obligations; and (ii) funds received from the issuance of
    tax-exempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various
    projects or facilities. These balances are primarily included
    within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

The decrease in capping, closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation funds from December 31, 2009 is due to our
    implementation of revised accounting guidance related to the
    consolidation of variable interest entities. Effective
    January 1, 2010, we were required to deconsolidate trusts
    for which power over significant activities is shared, which
    reduced our restricted trust and escrow accounts by
    $109 million. Beginning in 2010, our interests in these
    variable interest entities were accounted for as investments in
    unconsolidated entities and receivables. These amounts are
    recorded in “Other receivables” and as long-term
    “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The decrease in tax-exempt bond funds is attributable to
    reimbursements distributed to us by the trust funds for approved
    construction and equipment expenditures and to a decrease in new
    tax-exempt borrowings.

Debt

— We use long-term borrowings in addition
    to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall
    financial strategy to support and grow our business. We
    primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a
    long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities
    when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as
    of December 31, 2010 are described in Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31,
    2009 to December 31, 2010 can primarily be attributed to
    (i) $908 million of cash borrowings, including
    $592 million in net proceeds from the June 2010 issuance of
    $600 million of senior notes; (ii) the cash repayment
    of $1,112 million of outstanding borrowings at



their scheduled maturities, including the repayment of
    $600 million of senior notes in August 2010 and;
    (iii) our investment in an entity that invests in and
    manages federal low-income housing projects, which increased our
    debt obligation by $215 million.

As of December 31, 2010, we had (i) $502 million
    of debt maturing within twelve months, including
    U.S.$212 million under our Canadian credit facility and
    $147 million of 7.65% senior notes that mature in
    March 2011; and (ii) $405 million of fixed-rate
    tax-exempt borrowings subject to re-pricing within the next
    twelve months. The amount reported as the current portion of
    long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 excludes
    $674 million of these amounts because we have the intent
    and ability to refinance portions of our current maturities on a
    long-term basis.

We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and
    financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our
    outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31,
    categorized by type of facility:

The decrease in the utilization of the revolving credit facility
    and the increase in the utilization of our letter of credit and
    other facilities is due to the significantly higher costs
    associated with the $2.0 billion revolving credit facility
    that was executed in June 2010.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating
    cash flows for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below:

•

Increase in earnings

— Our income from
    operations increased by $229 million on a

year-over-year

basis, driven, in part, by a favorable cash benefit of
    $77 million resulting from a litigation settlement in April
    2010. This earnings increase was also impacted by (i) the
    recognition of a $51 million non-cash charge during the
    fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the abandonment of
    licensed revenue management software and (ii) the
    recognition of a $27 million non-cash charge in the fourth
    quarter of 2009 as a result of a change in expectations for the
    future operations of an inactive landfill in California.



The comparison of our 2010 and 2009 income from operations was
    also affected by a $91 million increase in non-cash charges
    attributable to (i) equity-based compensation expense;
    (ii) interest accretion on landfill liabilities;
    (iii) interest accretion and discount rate adjustments on
    environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets;
    (iv) depreciation and amortization; and (v) the impact
    of the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multiemployer
    pension plans. While the increase in non-cash charges
    unfavorably affected our earnings comparison, there is no impact
    on net cash provided by operating activities.

•

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from
    business acquisitions and divestitures —

Our cash
    flow from operations was negatively impacted in 2010 and
    favorably impacted in 2009, by changes in our working capital
    accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from
    year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts
    receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and
    timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes, which
    are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments.
    Additionally, the following are other significant items that
    affected our cash flow from operations:

•

Increased income tax payments

— Cash paid for
    income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with
    equity-based transactions, was approximately $86 million
    higher on a

year-over-year

basis. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed
    in the

Provision for income taxes

section above.

•

Increased interest payments

— Cash paid for
    interest was approximately $61 million higher on a

year-over-year

basis. This increase is primarily due to (i) the issuance
    of an additional $600 million of senior notes in November
    2009 to support acquisitions and investments made throughout
    2010; (ii) significantly higher costs related to the
    execution and maintenance of our revolving credit facility,
    which was refinanced in June 2010; and (iii) a decrease in
    benefits to interest expense provided by active interest rate
    swaps as a result of decreases in the notional amount of swaps
    outstanding.

•

Settlement of Canadian hedge

— In December
    2010, our previously existing foreign currency hedges matured
    and we paid cash of $37 million upon settlement. The cash
    payment from the settlement has been classified as a change in
    accrued liabilities within “Net cash provided by operating
    activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

•

Liquidation of a foreign subsidiary

— We
    received a $65 million federal tax refund in the third
    quarter of 2010 related to the liquidation of a foreign
    subsidiary in 2009. The cash proceeds have been classified as a
    change in other current assets within “Net cash provided
    b

y

operating activities” in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    operating cash flows for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below:

•

Decrease in earnings

— Our income from
    operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased
    by $419 million on a

year-over-year

basis. However, this earnings decline was also impacted by
    (i) the recognition of a $51 million non-cash charge
    during the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the
    abandonment of licensed revenue management software and
    (ii) the recognition of a $27 million non-cash charge
    in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of a change in
    expectations for the future operations of a landfill in
    California.

Further, approximately $55 million of the

year-over-year

decrease in earnings is related to the impact of divestiture
    gains and gains on sale of assets for which the cash flow
    impacts are reflected in investing activities in the caption
    “Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other sales
    of assets.”

The comparison of our 2009 and 2008 income from operations was
    also affected by an $86 million decrease in non-cash
    charges attributable to (i) interest accretion and discount
    rate adjustments on environmental remediation liabilities and
    recovery assets; (ii) equity-based compensation expense;
    and (iii) interest accretion on landfill liabilities. While
    the decrease in non-cash charges favorably affected our earnings
    comparison, there is no impact on net cash provided by operating
    activities.

•

Change in receivables

— There was a significant
    decrease in the operating cash flows provided by changes in our
    receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and
    divestitures, when comparing 2009 with 2008. This decrease is
    primarily attributable to unusual activity in 2008, including
    (i) the significant decrease in



sequential quarter revenues when comparing the fourth quarter of
    2008 with the third quarter of 2008, which was driven by the
    decline in the demand and market prices for recyclable
    commodities; and (ii) the collection of a $60 million
    outstanding receivable related to our investments in synthetic
    fuel production facilities that provided us with
    Section 45K tax credits through 2007.

•

Decreased income tax payments

— Cash paid for
    income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with
    equity-based transactions, was approximately $140 million
    lower on a

year-over-year

basis. The comparability of our effective tax rates is discussed
    in the

Provision for income taxes

section above.

•

Decreased interest payments

— Cash paid for
    interest was approximately $60 million lower on a

year-over-year

basis. This decrease is primarily due to a decline in market
    interest rates, which (i) increased the benefits to our
    interest costs provided by our active interest rate swap
    agreements and (ii) reduced the interest costs associated
    with our variable-rate tax-exempt debt.

•

Decreased bonus payments

— Employee bonus
    payments earned in 2008, which were paid in the first quarter of
    2009, were lower than the bonus payments earned in 2007 but paid
    in 2008 due to the relative strength of our financial
    performance against incentive measures in 2007 as compared with
    2008. The

year-over-year

decrease in cash bonuses favorably affected the comparison of
    our cash flow from operations by approximately $35 million.

•

Termination of interest rate swaps

— In
    December 2009, we elected to terminate interest rate swaps with
    a notional amount of $350 million that were scheduled to
    mature in November 2012. Upon termination of the swaps, we
    received $20 million in cash for their fair value plus
    accrued interest receivable. The cash proceeds received from the
    termination of interest rate swap agreements have been
    classified as a change in other assets within “Net cash
    provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows.

•

Accounts payable processes

— Changes in our
    accounts payable balances have favorably impacted our

year-over-year

cash flow from operations change by approximately
    $20 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Acquisitions —

Our spending on acquisitions
    increased from $280 million and $281 million during
    2008 and 2009, respectively, to $407 million in 2010.
    During the second quarter of 2010, we paid approximately
    $150 million to acquire a

waste-to-energy

facility in Portsmouth, Virginia. We continue to focus on
    accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will
    contribute to improved future results of operations and enhance
    and expand our existing service offerings.

•

Capital expenditures —

We used
    $1,104 million during 2010 for capital expenditures,
    compared with $1,179 million in 2009 and
    $1,221 million in 2008.

•

Net receipts from restricted funds —

Net cash
    received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which
    are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for
    our capital needs, contributed $48 million to our investing
    activities in 2010 compared with $196 million in 2009 and
    $178 million in 2008. The significant decrease in cash
    received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts during
    2010 is due to a decrease in tax-exempt borrowings.

•

Investments in unconsolidated entities

— We
    made $173 million of cash investments in unconsolidated
    entities during 2010. These cash investments were primarily
    related to a $142 million payment made to acquire a 40%
    equity investment in Shanghai Environment Group, a subsidiary of
    Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co., Ltd. As a joint venture partner
    in SEG, we will participate in the operation and management of

waste-to-energy

and other waste services in the Chinese market. SEG will also
    focus on building new

waste-to-energy

facilities in China.



Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Share repurchases and dividend payments —

Our
    2010, 2009 and 2008 share repurchases and dividend payments
    have been made in accordance with capital allocation programs
    approved by our Board of Directors.

We paid $501 million for share repurchases in 2010,
    compared with $226 million in 2009 and $410 million in
    2008. We repurchased approximately 15 million,
    7 million and 12 million shares of our common stock in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in share
    repurchases during 2009 is largely attributable to the
    suspension of our share repurchases in July 2008 in connection
    with a proposed acquisition and to the state of the financial
    markets and the economy. Given the stabilization of the capital
    markets and economic conditions, we elected to resume our share
    repurchases during the third quarter of 2009.

We paid an aggregate of $604 million in cash dividends
    during 2010, compared with $569 million in 2009 and
    $531 million in 2008. The increase in dividend payments is
    due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.27 in
    2008, to $0.29 in 2009 and to $0.315 in 2010, and has been
    offset in part by a reduction in our common stock outstanding as
    a result of our share repurchase programs.

In December 2010, the Board of Directors announced that it
    expects future quarterly dividend payments will be $0.34 per
    share for dividends declared in 2011. All 2011 share
    repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, up to
    $575 million, as approved by the Board of Directors in
    December 2010, and all actual future dividends must first be
    declared by the Board of Directors at its discretion, with all
    decisions dependent on various factors, including our net
    earnings, financial condition, cash required for future
    acquisitions and investments and other factors deemed relevant.

•

Proceeds from the exercise of common stock
    options—

The exercise of common stock options and
    the related excess tax benefits generated a total of
    $54 million of financing cash inflows during 2010 compared
    with $20 million during 2009 and $37 million in 2008.

•

Net debt repayments —

Net debt repayments were
    $204 million in 2010, net debt borrowings were
    $414 million in 2009 and net debt repayments were
    $260 million in 2008. The following summarizes our most
    significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each
    year (in millions):

This summary excludes the impacts of non-cash borrowings and
    debt repayments. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we had a $215 million non-cash increase in our debt
    obligations as a result of the



issuance of a note payable in return for a noncontrolling
    interest in a limited liability company established to invest in
    and manage low-income housing properties. This investment is
    discussed in detail in Note 9. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, these non-cash financing
    activities were primarily associated with our tax-exempt bond
    financings. Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issuances, net of
    principal repayments made directly from trust funds, were
    $105 million in 2009 and $169 million in 2008.

•

Other —

Net cash provided by other financing
    activities was $18 million in 2010 while net cash used in
    other financing activities was $50 million in 2009 and
    $43 million in 2008. These activities are primarily
    attributable to changes in our accrued liabilities for checks
    written in excess of cash balances due to the timing of cash
    deposits or payments. The cash provided by these activities in
    2010 was offset, in part, by $13 million of financing costs
    paid to execute our new $2.0 billion revolving credit
    facility.

Summary
    of Contractual Obligations

(f)

Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various
    contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary
    course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity
    driven. For these contracts, we have estimated our future
    obligations based on the current market values of the underlying
    products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the
    table are not necessarily indicative of our actual cash flow
    obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our
    unconditional purchase obligations.

Liquidity
    Impacts of Uncertain Tax Positions

As discussed in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax
    benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily
    included as a component of long-term “Other
    liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet because the
    Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the
    liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve
    months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would
    make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but
    do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations
    will materially affect our liquidity.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated
    entities as discussed in the

Guarantees

section of
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These
    arrangements have not materially affected our financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity during the year
    ended December 31, 2010 nor are they expected to have a
    material impact on our future financial position, results of
    operations or liquidity.

Inflation

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
    diesel fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent
    years, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in
    the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse
    effect on our results of operations. However, as of
    December 31, 2010, over 35% of our collection revenues are
    generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments
    based on various indices intended to measure inflation.
    Additionally, management’s estimates associated with
    inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our
    accounting for landfill and environmental remediation
    liabilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

— In
    October 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated
    with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This amended
    guidance addresses the determination of when individual
    deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate
    units of accounting and modifies the manner in which
    consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable
    deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance
    associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements became
    effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The new
    accounting standard may be applied either retrospectively for
    all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered
    into or materially modified after the date of adoption. We do
    not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

However, our adoption of this guidance may significantly impact
    our accounting and reporting for future revenue arrangements to
    the extent they are material.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market
    risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency
    rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use
    derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our
    derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that
    provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of
    December 31, 2010, all of our derivative transactions were
    related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are
    exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our
    derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative
    positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the
    creditworthiness of the counterparties.



Interest Rate Exposure

— Our exposure to market
    risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our
    financing activities, although our interest costs can also be
    significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance
    needs, which are discussed in the

Financial Assurance and
    Insurance Obligations

section of Item 1.

As of December 31, 2010, we had $8.8 billion of
    long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair
    value adjustments attributable to interest rate derivatives,
    discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of
    approximately $1.8 billion of our outstanding debt
    obligations are subject to change during 2011. The most
    significant components of our variable-rate debt obligations are
    (i) $500 million of “receive fixed, pay
    variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding
    fixed-rate senior notes; (ii) $611 million of
    tax-exempt bonds that are subject to

re-pricing

on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process;
    (iii) $405 million of tax-exempt bonds with term
    interest rate periods that are subject to re-pricing within
    twelve months; and (iv) $215 million of outstanding
    advances under our Canadian Credit Facility. As of
    December 31, 2009, the effective interest rates of
    approximately $3.0 billion of our outstanding debt
    obligations were subject to change within twelve months.

The decrease in outstanding debt obligations exposed to variable
    interest rates in 2010 is generally a result of a
    $600 million decrease in the notional amount of active
    interest rate swaps and decreases in our variable-rate
    tax-exempt bonds. The decline in our variable-rate debt
    obligations has reduced the potential volatility to our
    operating results and cash flows that results from fluctuations
    in market interest rates. We currently estimate that a
    100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our
    outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our
    2011 interest expense by approximately $13 million.

Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest
    rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for
    certain of our “fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through
    the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve
    months. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we have
    forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of
    $525 million. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt
    obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments can
    increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates
    change.

We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market
    rate changes might affect the fair value of our market
    risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses
    are inherently limited because they reflect a singular,
    hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may
    vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, one
    percentage point increase in interest rates across all
    maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these
    instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined
    debt and interest rate derivative positions by approximately
    $658 million at December 31, 2010.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have
    significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets
    held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets
    are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments
    including money market funds that invest in U.S. government
    obligations with original maturities of three months or less.
    Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we
    believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to
    interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

Commodity Price Exposure

— In the normal course
    of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that
    expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for
    commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including
    aluminum, old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint; and
    electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices
    in many of the markets where we operate. With the exception of
    electricity commodity derivatives, which are discussed below, we
    generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the risks
    associated with changes in the market prices of these
    commodities during the three years ended December 31, 2010.
    Alternatively, we attempt to manage these risks through
    operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the
    prices we charge our customers for the services provided.
    Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase
    or decrease, our revenues also increase or decrease.

During 2010, approximately 47% of the electricity revenue at our

waste-to-energy

facilities was subject to current market rates, and we currently
    expect that nearly 54% of our electricity revenues at our

waste-to-energy

facilities will be at market rates by the end of 2011. Our
    exposure to variability associated with changes in market prices
    for electricity has increased because several long-term power
    purchase agreements have expired. The energy markets have
    changed significantly since the expiring contracts were executed
    and we have found that medium- and long-term electricity
    contracts are less favorable in the current environment. As we
    renegotiate our power-purchase agreements, we expect that a more
    substantial portion of our energy sales at our

waste-to-energy

facilities and landfill

gas-to-energy

plants will be based on current market rates. Accordingly, in
    2010 we implemented a more



actively managed energy program, which includes a hedging
    strategy intended to decrease the exposure of our revenues to
    volatility due to market prices for electricity. Refer to
    Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information regarding our electricity commodity
    derivatives.

Currency Rate Exposure

— From time to time, we
    use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency
    translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency
    denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives
    have not materially affected our financial position or results
    of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly
    affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we
    believe these changes in fair value would not have a material
    impact to the Company. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information regarding our
    foreign currency derivatives.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal
    controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to
    (i) the reliability of our financial reporting;
    (ii) the reliability of the preparation and presentation of
    the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States; and (iii) the safeguarding of assets from
    unauthorized use or disposition.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010
    based on the Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Through this evaluation, we did not
    identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls. There
    are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of
    internal control over financial reporting; however, based on our
    evaluation, we have concluded that our internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Waste Management,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in equity for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2010, and our report dated February 17, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in equity for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Waste Management, Inc. at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted
    certain provisions of ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation”
    related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial
    statements. Additionally, effective January 1, 2010, the
    Company adopted certain provisions of ASC Topic 810,
    “Consolidation” related to the consolidation of
    variable interest entities.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Waste
    Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial

WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

1.

Business

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation;
    Waste Management’s wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which
    Waste Management or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary
    as described in Note 20. Waste Management is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries.
    When the terms “the Company,” “we,”
    “us” or “our” are used in this document,
    those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
    subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When
    we use the term “WM,” we are referring only to Waste
    Management, Inc., the parent holding company.

We are the leading provider of comprehensive waste management
    services in North America. Our subsidiaries provide collection,
    transfer, recycling, and disposal services. We are also a
    leading developer, operator and owner of

waste-to-energy

and landfill

gas-to-energy

facilities in the United States. Our customers include
    residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers
    throughout North America.

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through five
    Groups. Our four geographic Groups, comprised of our Eastern,
    Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, provide collection,
    transfer, disposal (in both solid waste and hazardous waste
    landfills) and recycling services. Our fifth Group is the
    Wheelabrator Group, which provides

waste-to-energy

services and manages

waste-to-energy

facilities and independent power production plants. We also
    provide additional services that are not managed through our
    five Groups, which are presented in this report as
    “Other.” Additional information related to our
    segments can be found in Note 21.

Accounting
    Changes and Reclassifications

Accounting
    Changes

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

—
    In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
    issued revised authoritative guidance associated with the
    consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance
    primarily uses a qualitative approach for determining whether an
    enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
    entity, and is, therefore, required to consolidate the entity.
    This new guidance generally defines the primary beneficiary as
    the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities
    of the variable interest entity that can most significantly
    impact the entity’s performance and (ii) the
    obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits
    from the variable interest entity that could be significant from
    the perspective of the entity. The new guidance also requires
    that we continually reassess whether we are the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity rather than conducting
    a reassessment only upon the occurrence of specific events.

As a result of our implementation of this guidance, effective
    January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain capping,
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation trusts
    because we share power over significant activities of these
    trusts with others. Our financial interests in these entities
    are discussed in Note 20. The deconsolidation of these
    trusts has not materially affected our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows during the periods presented.

Business Combinations

— In December 2007, the
    FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance associated
    with business combinations. This guidance clarified and revised
    the principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This guidance also
    addressed the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired
    in business combinations and expanded disclosure requirements
    related to business combinations. Effective January 1,
    2009, we adopted the FASB’s revised guidance associated
    with business combinations. The portions of this guidance that
    relate to business combinations completed before January 1,
    2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. Further, business combinations completed
    subsequent to January 1, 2009, which are discussed in
    Note 19, have not been material to our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent that
    future business combinations are material, our adoption of the
    FASB’s revised authoritative guidance associated with
    business combinations may significantly impact our accounting
    and reporting for future acquisitions, principally as a result
    of (i) expanded requirements to value acquired assets,



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

liabilities and contingencies at their fair values when such
    amounts can be determined and (ii) the requirement that
    acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be
    expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the
    cost of the acquisition.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements

— In December 2007, the FASB issued
    authoritative guidance that established accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for
    the de-consolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance also
    established that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
    ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be
    reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. We
    adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The presentation
    and disclosure requirements of this guidance, which must be
    applied retrospectively for all periods presented, resulted in
    reclassifications to our prior period consolidated financial
    information and the remeasurement of our 2008 effective tax
    rate, which is discussed in Note 9.

Fair Value Measurements

— In September 2006,
    the FASB issued authoritative guidance associated with fair
    value measurements. This guidance defined fair value,
    established a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded
    disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the
    FASB delayed the effective date of the guidance for all
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those
    that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
    Accordingly, we adopted this guidance for assets and liabilities
    recognized at fair value on a recurring basis effective
    January 1, 2008 and adopted the guidance for non-financial
    assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis
    effective January 1, 2009. The application of the fair
    value framework did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post-retirement Plans

— In September 2006,
    the FASB issued revisions to the authoritative guidance
    associated with the accounting and reporting of post-retirement
    benefit plans. This guidance required companies to recognize the
    overfunded or underfunded status of their defined benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans as an asset or liability
    and to recognize changes in that funded status through
    comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. We
    adopted these recognition provisions effective December 31,
    2006. The FASB’s revised guidance also required companies
    to measure the funded status of defined benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans as of their year-end reporting date.
    These measurement date provisions were effective for us as of
    December 31, 2008. We applied the measurement provisions by
    measuring our benefit obligations as of September 30, 2007,
    our prior measurement date, and recognizing a pro-rata share of
    net benefit costs for the transition period from October 1,
    2007 to December 31, 2008 as a cumulative effect of change
    in accounting principle in retained earnings as of
    December 31, 2008. The application of the recognition and
    measurement provisions of this revised authoritative guidance
    did not have a material impact on our financial position or
    results of operations for the periods presented.

Subsequent Events

— We have evaluated
    subsequent events through the date and time the financial
    statements were issued. No material subsequent events have
    occurred since December 31, 2010 that required recognition
    or disclosure in our current period financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain minor reclassifications have been made to our prior
    period consolidated financial information in order to conform to
    the current year presentation.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of WM, its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries
    and certain variable interest entities for which we have
    determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All material
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
    Investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling
    financial interest are accounted for under either the equity
    method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Estimates
    and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity,
    revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and
    assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent
    on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of
    precision from data available or simply cannot be readily
    calculated based on generally accepted methods. In some cases,
    these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we
    must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial
    statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates
    and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of
    uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
    environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments,
    deferred income taxes, and reserves associated with our insured
    and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed in
    additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially
    from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the
    preparation of our financial statements.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit
    and money market funds that invest in U.S. government
    obligations with original maturities of three months or less.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents, investments held within our trust funds and escrow
    accounts, accounts receivable and derivative instruments. We
    make efforts to control our exposure to credit risk associated
    with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other
    financial interests with a diverse group of credit-worthy
    financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial
    instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument;
    and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension
    that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring
    procedures, although generally we do not have collateral
    requirements for credit extensions. We also control our exposure
    associated with trade receivables by discontinuing service, to
    the extent allowable, to non-paying customers. However, our
    overall credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited
    due to the large number of geographically diverse customers we
    service. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, no single customer
    represented greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.

Trade
    and Other Receivables

Our receivables are recorded when billed or when cash is
    advanced and represent claims against third parties that will be
    settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of
    the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated
    net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful
    accounts based on historical collection trends; type of
    customer, such as municipal or commercial; the age of
    outstanding receivables; and existing economic conditions. If
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific
    receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is
    given to the collectibility of those balances and the allowance
    is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are
    written off when our internal collection efforts have been
    unsuccessful. Also, we recognize interest income on long-term
    interest-bearing notes receivable as the interest accrues under
    the terms of the notes.

Landfill
    Accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize
    various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept
    waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land
    (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer
    property); permitting; excavation; liner material and
    installation; landfill leachate collection systems; landfill gas
    collection systems; environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas; and directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest,

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes asset retirement
    costs, which represent estimates of future costs associated with
    landfill capping, closure and post-closure activities. These
    costs are discussed below.

Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

—
    Following is a description of our asset retirement activities
    and our related accounting:

•

Capping

— Involves the installation of flexible
    membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and
    compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where
    total airspace capacity has been consumed. Capping asset
    retirement obligations are recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific capping
    event with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Each
    capping event is accounted for as a discrete obligation and
    recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the
    discounted cash flows and capacity associated with each capping
    event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the
    final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required),
    demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs
    incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but before the
    landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state
    regulatory agency. These costs are accrued as an asset
    retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of
    the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Closure obligations are accrued over the life of the
    landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows
    associated with performing closure activities.

•

Post-Closure

— Involves the maintenance and
    monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by
    the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to
    maintain and monitor landfill sites for a

30-year

period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an
    asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the
    life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the
    landfill asset. Post-closure obligations are accrued over the
    life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash
    flows associated with performing post-closure activities.

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from
    our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our
    estimates are based on our interpretation of current
    requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to
    approximate fair value. Absent quoted market prices, the
    estimate of fair value is based on the best available
    information, including the results of present value techniques.
    In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our
    obligations for capping, closure and post-closure. We use
    historical experience, professional engineering judgment and
    quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the
    fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize
    these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract
    with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those
    instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the
    incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component
    of operating income when the work is performed.

Once we have determined the capping, closure and post-closure
    costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time of payment
    and discount those expected future costs back to present value.
    During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
    inflated these costs in current dollars until the expected time
    of payment using an inflation rate of 2.5%. We discount these
    costs to present value using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate
    effective at the time an obligation is incurred, consistent with
    the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in expectations
    that result in an upward revision to the estimated cash flows
    are treated as a new liability and discounted at the current
    rate while downward revisions are discounted at the historical
    weighted-average rate of the recorded obligation. As a result,
    the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to calculate
    the present value of an obligation is specific to each
    individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted-average
    rate applicable to our asset retirement obligations at
    December 31, 2010 is between 6.0% and 8.0%, the range of
    the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rates effective since we
    adopted the FASB’s authoritative guidance related to asset
    retirement obligations in 2003. We expect to apply a
    credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate of 5.5% to liabilities
    incurred in the first quarter of 2011.

We record the estimated fair value of capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity
    consumed through the current period. The fair value of capping
    obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace
    consumed to date for each capping event and the expected timing
    of each capping event. The fair value of closure and
    post-closure obligations is developed based on our estimates of
    the airspace consumed to date for the entire landfill and the
    expected timing of each closure and post-closure activity.
    Because these

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present
    value techniques, changes in the estimated cost or timing of
    future capping, closure and post-closure activities could result
    in a material change in these liabilities, related assets and
    results of operations. We assess the appropriateness of the
    estimates used to develop our recorded balances annually, or
    more often if significant facts change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or
    extent of future capping and closure and post-closure activities
    typically result in both (i) a current adjustment to the
    recorded liability and landfill asset; and (ii) a change in
    liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over
    either the remaining capacity of the related discrete capping
    event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace (as
    defined below) of the landfill. Any changes related to the
    capitalized and future cost of the landfill assets are then
    recognized in accordance with our amortization policy, which
    would generally result in amortization expense being recognized
    prospectively over the remaining capacity of the capping event
    or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the
    landfill, as appropriate. Changes in such estimates associated
    with airspace that has been fully utilized result in an
    adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill assets with an
    immediate corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace
    amortization expense.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the
    timing and cost of future capping, closure and post-closure of
    fully utilized airspace resulted in $13 million,
    $14 million and $3 million in net credits to landfill
    airspace amortization expense, respectively, with the majority
    of these credits resulting from revised estimates associated
    with capping changes. In managing our landfills, our engineers
    look for ways to reduce or defer our construction costs,
    including capping costs. The benefit recognized in these years
    was generally the result of (i) concerted efforts to
    improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills and volume
    declines, both of which have allowed us to delay spending for
    capping activities; (ii) effectively managing the cost of
    capping material and construction; or (iii) landfill
    expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred capping costs.

Interest accretion on capping, closure and post-closure
    liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and
    is recorded as capping, closure and post-closure expense, which
    is included in “Operating” costs and expenses within
    our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The
    amortizable basis of a landfill includes (i) amounts
    previously expended and capitalized; (ii) capitalized
    landfill capping, closure and post-closure costs;
    (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs
    required to develop the landfill site to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity; and (iv) projected asset retirement
    costs related to landfill capping, closure and post-closure
    activities.

Amortization is recorded on a

units-of-consumption

basis, applying expense as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is
    calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis
    of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the
    corresponding asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do
    not own, but operate through operating or lease arrangements,
    the rate per ton is calculated based on expected capacity to be
    utilized over the lesser of the contractual term of the
    underlying agreement or the life of the landfill.

We apply the following guidelines in determining a
    landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:

•

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently
    unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances.
    First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort,
    we must generally expect the initial expansion permit
    application to be submitted



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received
    within five years. Second, we must believe the success of
    obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the
    following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing
    landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state
    or provincial approvals;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 33 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2010, 14 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required
    approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or
    political opposition that could impede the expansion process.
    The remaining six landfills required approval primarily due to
    the permit application processes not meeting the one- or
    five-year requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement costs related to capping, closure and post-closure of
    the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor, or
    AUF, is established to calculate the remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the
    measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is
    then adjusted to account for settlement. The amount of
    settlement that is forecasted will take into account several
    site-specific factors including current and projected mix of
    waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated
    number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste,
    anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or
    recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In
    addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a
    subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group, and the
    AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as
    necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that
    the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the
    life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill
    approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and
    deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the
    corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization
    rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping
    event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities
    and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the
    future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often,
    as significant facts change.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of capping, closure and post-closure
    activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our
    expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly
    different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that
    such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be
    significantly different than actual results, lower profitability
    may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher
    expenses, or higher profitability may result if the opposite
    occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion
    capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the
    recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to
    recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher
    amortization expense. If it is determined that the likelihood of
    receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized
    costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental
    Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that
    existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include
    potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations,
    settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as
    costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up,
    such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental
    internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for
    expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations
    when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.
    We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation
    and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on
    a number of estimates and assumptions.

Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we
    estimate costs required to remediate sites based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation is
    inherently difficult. We recognize and accrue for an estimated
    remediation liability only when we determine that such liability
    is both probable and reasonably estimable. Determining the
    method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number
    of assumptions be made. There can sometimes be a range of
    reasonable estimates of the costs associated with the
    investigation of the extent of environmental impact and
    identification of likely site-remediation alternatives. In these
    cases, we use the amount within a range that constitutes our
    best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the
    low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges,
    our aggregate potential liability would be approximately
    $150 million higher than the $284 million recorded in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31,
    2010. Our ultimate responsibility may differ materially from
    current estimates. It is possible that technological, regulatory
    or enforcement developments, the results of environmental
    studies, the inability to identify other PRPs, the inability of
    other PRPs to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities,
    or other factors could require us to record additional
    liabilities. Our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities
    could result in revisions to our accruals that could cause
    upward or downward adjustments to income from operations. These
    adjustments could be material in any given period.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular
    environmental remediation liability and the timing of the
    payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in
    current dollars (by 2.5% at both December 31, 2010 and
    2009) until the expected time of payment and discount the
    cost to present value using a risk-free discount rate, which is
    based on the rate for United States Treasury bonds with a term
    approximating the weighted average period until settlement of
    the underlying obligation. We determine the risk-free discount
    rate and the inflation rate on an annual basis unless interim
    changes would significantly impact our results of operations.
    For remedial liabilities that have been discounted, we include
    interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in
    “Operating” costs and expenses in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the
    impacts of revisions in the risk-free discount rate applied to
    our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets
    during the reported periods (in millions) and the risk-free
    discount rate applied as of each reporting date:

In 2009, $9 million of the reduction in

    charge to “Operating” expenses was attributable to
    noncontrolling interests.

The portion of our recorded environmental remediation
    liabilities that has never been subject to inflation or
    discounting, as the amounts and timing of payments are not
    readily determinable, was $81 million at December 31,
    2010 and $44 million at December 31, 2009. Had we not
    inflated and discounted any portion of our environmental
    remediation liability, the amount recorded would have increased
    by $15 million and $20 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Property
    and Equipment (exclusive of landfills, discussed
    above)

We record property and equipment at cost. Expenditures for major
    additions and improvements are capitalized and maintenance
    activities are expensed as incurred. We depreciate property and
    equipment over the estimated useful life of the asset using the
    straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for our
    depreciable property and equipment. When property and equipment
    are retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any
    resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations as
    an offset or increase to operating expense for the period.

The estimated useful lives for significant property and
    equipment categories are as follows (in years):

    materials and services used in developing or obtaining the
    software and internal costs for employees directly associated
    with the software development project. As of December 31,
    2010, capitalized costs for software placed in service, net of
    accumulated depreciation, were $44 million. In addition,
    our furniture, fixtures and office equipment includes
    $51 million as of December 31, 2010 and
    $46 million as of December 31, 2009 for costs incurred
    for software under development.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill, transfer station or

waste-to-energy

facility. Our leases have varying terms. Some may include
    renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions,
    penalties or other obligations that we consider in determining
    minimum lease payments. The leases are classified as either
    operating leases or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating Leases (excluding landfills discussed
    below)

— The majority of our leases are operating
    leases. This classification generally can be attributed to
    either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease payments as a
    result of real property lease obligations that vary based on the
    volume of waste we receive or process or (ii) minimum lease
    terms that are much shorter than the assets’ economic
    useful lives. Management expects that in the normal course of
    business our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by other
    leases, or replaced with fixed asset expenditures. Our rent
    expense during each of the last three years and our future
    minimum operating lease payments for each of the next five years
    for which we are contractually obligated as of December 31,
    2010 are disclosed in Note 11.

Capital Leases

(

excluding landfills discussed
    below)

— Assets under capital leases are
    capitalized using interest rates determined at the inception of
    each lease and are amortized over either the useful life of the
    asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a straight-line
    basis. The present value of the related lease payments is
    recorded as a debt obligation. Our future minimum annual capital
    lease payments are included in our total future debt obligations
    as disclosed in Note 7.

Landfill Leases

— From an operating
    perspective, landfills that we lease are similar to landfills we
    own because generally we own the landfill’s operating
    permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term,
    which in many cases is the life of the landfill. As a result,
    our landfill leases are generally capital leases. The most
    significant portion of our rental obligations for landfill
    leases is contingent upon operating factors such as disposal
    volumes and often there are no contractual minimum rental
    obligations. Contingent rental obligations are expensed as
    incurred. For landfill capital leases that provide for minimum
    contractual rental obligations, we record the present value of
    the minimum obligation as part of the landfill asset, which is
    amortized on a

units-of-consumption

basis over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the
    landfill.

Acquisitions

We generally recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    in business combinations, including contingent assets and
    liabilities, based on fair value estimates as of the date of
    acquisition.

Contingent Consideration —

In certain
    acquisitions, we agree to pay additional amounts to sellers
    contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of
    certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue levels,
    targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for
    expanded landfill airspace. For acquisitions completed in 2009
    and 2010, we have recognized liabilities for these contingent
    obligations based on their estimated fair value at the date of
    acquisition with any differences between the acquisition-date
    fair value and the ultimate settlement of the obligations being
    recognized as an adjustment to income from operations. For
    acquisitions completed before 2009, these obligations were
    recognized as incurred and accounted for as an adjustment to the
    initial purchase price of the acquired assets.

Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities —

Assets and liabilities arising from contingencies such as
    pre-acquisition environmental matters and litigation are
    recognized at their acquisition-date fair value when their
    respective fair values can be determined. If the fair values of
    such contingencies cannot be determined, they are recognized at
    the acquisition date if the contingencies are probable and an
    amount can be reasonably estimated. Acquisition-date fair value
    estimates are revised as necessary and accounted for as an
    adjustment to income from operations if, and when, additional
    information regarding these contingencies becomes available to
    further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Beginning in 2009, all acquisition-related transaction costs
    have been expensed as incurred. For acquisitions completed
    before 2009, direct costs incurred for a business combination
    were accounted for as part of the cost of the acquired business.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value
    of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize
    goodwill, but as discussed in the “Asset Impairments”
    section below, we assess our goodwill for impairment at least
    annually.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts,
    customer lists, covenants

not-to-compete,

licenses, permits (other than landfill permits, as all
    landfill-related intangible assets are combined with landfill
    tangible assets and amortized using our landfill amortization
    policy), and other contracts. Other intangible assets are
    recorded at cost and are generally amortized using either a 150%
    declining balance approach or a straight-line basis as we
    determine appropriate. Customer contracts and customer lists are
    typically amortized over ten years. Covenants

not-to-compete

are amortized over the term of the non-compete covenant, which
    is generally two to five years. Licenses, permits and other
    contracts are amortized over the definitive terms of the related
    agreements. If the underlying agreement does not contain
    definitive terms and the useful life is determined to be
    indefinite, the asset is not amortized.

Asset
    Impairments

We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes
    in circumstances are referred to as impairment indicators. If an
    impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability
    by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to
    its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows
    cannot be separately and independently identified for a single
    asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for
    the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash
    flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted
    expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by
    comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its
    carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by
    considering (i) internally developed discounted projected
    cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual
    third-party valuations;

and/or

(iii) information available regarding the current market
    for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group
    is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset
    or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is
    recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and
    is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures,
    asset impairments and unusual items” line item in our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash
    flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary
    from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our
    ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.

There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills
    and goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business that are not
    necessarily considered indicators of impairment of our landfill
    assets due to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess our
    goodwill for impairment. We assess whether an impairment exists
    by comparing the fair value of each operating segment to its
    carrying value, including goodwill. We use a combination of two
    valuation methods, a market approach and an income approach, to
    estimate the fair value of our operating segments. Fair value
    computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of
    factors, including projected future operating results, economic
    projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable
    marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in
    applying



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

them to this analysis. However, we believe that these two
    methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair
    value of our operating segments.

The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the
    aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar
    characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported
    cash flows. We then apply that multiple to our operating
    segments’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We
    believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a
    fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with
    operations and economic characteristics comparable to our
    operating segments.

The income approach is based on the long-term projected future
    cash flows of our operating segments. We discount the estimated
    cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of
    capital that considers factors such as the timing of the cash
    flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe
    that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair
    value estimate based upon our operating segments’ expected
    long-term performance considering the economic and market
    conditions that generally affect our business.

Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim
    basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that
    would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying value of
    goodwill has been impaired. Refer to Note 6 for additional
    information related to goodwill impairment considerations made
    during the reported periods.

Restricted
    Trust and Escrow Accounts

As of December 31, 2010, our restricted trust and escrow
    accounts consist principally of (i) funds deposited for
    purposes of settling landfill capping, closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation obligations; and (ii) funds
    received from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds held in trust for
    the construction of various projects or facilities. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $146 million and
    $306 million, respectively, of restricted trust and escrow
    accounts, which are primarily included in long-term “Other
    assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The decrease in
    restricted trust and escrow accounts from December 31, 2009
    is due to our implementation of revised accounting guidance
    related to the consolidation of variable interest entities.
    Additional information can be found in Note 2 and
    Note 20.

Capping, Closure, Post-Closure and Environmental Remediation
    Funds

— At several of our landfills, we provide
    financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust
    funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling capping,
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations.
    Balances maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts
    will fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory
    requirements; (ii) future deposits made to comply with
    contractual arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of funds
    for qualifying closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation activities; (iv) acquisitions or divestitures
    of landfills; and (v) changes in the fair value of the
    financial instruments held in the trust fund or escrow accounts.

Tax-Exempt Bond Funds

— We obtain funds from
    the issuance of industrial revenue bonds for the construction of
    collection and disposal facilities and for equipment necessary
    to provide waste management services. Proceeds from these
    arrangements are directly deposited into trust accounts, and we
    do not have the ability to use the funds in regular operating
    activities. Accordingly, these borrowings are treated as
    non-cash financing activities and are excluded from our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As our construction and
    equipment expenditures are documented and approved by the
    applicable bond trustee, the funds are released and we receive a
    cash reimbursement. These cash reimbursements are reported in
    the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an investing
    activity when the cash is released from the trust funds.
    Generally, the funds are fully expended within a few years of
    the debt issuance. When the debt matures, we repay our
    obligation with cash on hand and the debt repayments are
    included as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows.

Foreign
    Currency

We have operations in Canada. The functional currency of our
    Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars. The assets and
    liabilities of our foreign operations are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate during the
    period. The resulting translation difference is reflected as a
    component of comprehensive income.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage our
    risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates and market prices for electricity. We
    use interest rate swaps to maintain a strategic portion of our
    long-term debt obligations at variable, market-driven interest
    rates. In 2009, we entered into interest rate derivatives in
    anticipation of senior note issuances planned for 2010 through
    2014 to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for those
    anticipated issuances. Foreign currency exchange rate
    derivatives are used to hedge our exposure to changes in
    exchange rates for anticipated cash transactions between
    WM Holdings and its Canadian subsidiaries. We use
    electricity commodity derivatives to mitigate the variability in
    our revenues and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market
    prices for electricity.

We obtain current valuations of our interest rate, foreign
    currency and electricity commodity hedging instruments from
    third-party pricing models. The estimated fair values of
    derivatives used to hedge risks fluctuate over time and should
    be viewed in relation to the underlying hedged transaction and
    the overall management of our exposure to fluctuations in the
    underlying risks. The fair value of derivatives is included in
    other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued
    liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. Any
    ineffectiveness present in either fair value or cash flow hedges
    is recognized immediately in earnings without offset. There was
    no significant ineffectiveness in 2010, 2009 or 2008.

•

Interest Rate Derivatives

— Our “receive
    fixed, pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with
    outstanding fixed-rate senior notes have been designated as fair
    value hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, derivative
    assets are accounted for as an increase in the carrying value of
    our underlying debt obligations and derivative liabilities are
    accounted for as a decrease in the carrying value of our
    underlying debt instruments. These fair value adjustments are
    deferred and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
    over the remaining term of the hedged instruments. Treasury
    locks and forward-starting swaps executed in 2009 were
    designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.
    Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative
    instruments are recorded in “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” within the equity section of our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated balance in other
    comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings as the
    hedged cash flows occur. The impacts of our use of interest rate
    derivatives on the carrying value of our debt, accumulated other
    comprehensive income and interest expense are discussed in
    Note 8.

•

Foreign Currency Derivatives

— Our foreign
    currency derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges
    for accounting purposes, which results in the unrealized changes
    in the fair value of the derivative instruments being recorded
    in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” within the
    equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    associated balance in other comprehensive income is reclassified
    to earnings as the hedged cash flows affect earnings. In each of
    the periods presented, these derivatives have effectively
    mitigated the impacts of the hedged transactions, resulting in
    immaterial impacts to our results of operations for the periods
    presented.

•

Electricity Commodity Derivatives

— Our
    “receive fixed, pay variable” electricity commodity
    swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting
    purposes. The effective portion of the electricity commodity
    swap gains or losses is initially reported as a component of
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income” within the
    equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
    subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
    transactions affect earnings. These derivatives have not had a
    material impact to our financial statements for the periods
    presented.

Insured
    and Self-Insured Claims

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. The exposure for
    unpaid claims and associated expenses,



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

including incurred but not reported losses, generally is
    estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by
    factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. The
    gross estimated liability associated with settling unpaid claims
    is included in “Accrued liabilities” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets if expected to be settled within one
    year, or otherwise is included in long-term “Other
    liabilities.” Estimated insurance recoveries related to
    recorded liabilities are reflected as current “Other
    receivables” or long-term “Other assets” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets when we believe that the receipt of
    such amounts is probable.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste
    collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services and the
    sale of recycled commodities, electricity, steam and landfill
    gas. The fees charged for our services are generally defined in
    our service agreements and vary based on contract-specific terms
    such as frequency of service, weight, volume and the general
    market factors influencing a region’s rates. The fees we
    charge for our services generally include fuel surcharges, which
    are intended to pass through to customers increased direct and
    indirect costs incurred because of changes in market prices for
    fuel. We generally recognize revenue as services are performed
    or products are delivered. For example, revenue typically is
    recognized as waste is collected, tons are received at our
    landfills or transfer stations, recycling commodities are
    delivered or as kilowatts are delivered to a customer by a

waste-to-energy

facility or independent power production plant.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services
    include, among others, certain residential contracts that are
    billed on a quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance
    billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as
    revenue in the period service is provided.

Capitalized
    Interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development,
    including internal-use software and landfill expansion projects,
    and on certain assets under construction, including operating
    landfills, landfill

gas-to-energy

projects and

waste-to-energy

facilities. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, total interest costs
    were $490 million, $443 million and $472 million,
    respectively, of which $17 million in each year was
    capitalized. The interest capitalized in 2009 and 2008 was
    primarily for landfill construction costs. In 2010, interest was
    capitalized primarily for landfill construction costs and
    landfill

gas-to-energy

construction projects.

Income
    Taxes

The Company is subject to income tax in the United States,
    Canada and Puerto Rico. Current tax obligations associated with
    our provision for income taxes are reflected in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of “Accrued
    liabilities,” and the deferred tax obligations are
    reflected in “Deferred income taxes.”

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the
    financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The
    deferred income tax provision represents the change during the
    reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
    Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards
    and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant
    judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of
    deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for
    uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax
    return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain
    positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When
    facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through
    our provision for income taxes.

To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing
    authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have
    been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax
    expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with
    respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    We are party to pending or threatened legal proceedings covering
    a wide range of matters in various jurisdictions. It is
    difficult to predict the outcome of litigation, as it is subject
    to many uncertainties. Additionally, it is not always possible
    for management to make a meaningful estimate of the potential
    loss or range of loss associated with such contingencies.

(a)

The amounts reported for our environmental remediation
    liabilities include the impacts of revisions in the risk-free
    discount rates used to measure these obligations. The
    significant fluctuations in the applicable discount rates during
    the reported periods and the effects of those changes are
    discussed in Note 3. Additionally in 2010, we increased our
    cost estimates associated with environmental remediation
    obligations, primarily based on a review and evaluation of
    existing remediation projects. As these remediation projects
    progressed, more defined reclamation plans were developed,
    resulting in an increase in the required obligation to reflect
    the more likely remedies.

(b)

The amount reported for our landfill liabilities includes a
    reduction of approximately $50 million related to our
    year-end annual review of landfill capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations.

Our recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2010 include
    the impacts of inflating certain of these costs based on our
    expectations for the timing of cash settlement and of
    discounting certain of these costs to present value. Anticipated
    payments of currently identified environmental remediation
    liabilities as measured in current dollars are $43 million
    in 2011; $37 million in 2012; $21 million in 2013;
    $30 million in 2014; $24 million in 2015; and
    $141 million thereafter.

At several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by
    depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts
    for purposes of settling capping, closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation obligations. Generally, these trust
    funds are established to comply with statutory requirements and
    operating agreements and we are the sole beneficiary of the
    restricted balances. However, certain of the funds have been
    established for the benefit of both the Company and the host
    community in which we operate.

The fair value of trust funds and escrow accounts for which we
    are the sole beneficiary was $124 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $231 million as of
    December 31, 2009. As discussed in Note 20, effective
    January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated the trusts for which
    power over significant activities of the trust is shared, which
    reduced our restricted trust and escrow accounts by
    $109 million as of January 1, 2010. Beginning in 2010,
    our interests in these variable interest entities have been
    accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and
    receivables. The fair value of our investment in these entities
    was $103 million as of December 31, 2010. These
    amounts are included in “Other receivables” and as
    long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance

Goodwill

Goodwill was $5,726 million as of December 31, 2010
    compared with $5,632 million as of December 31, 2009.
    The $94 million increase in our goodwill during 2010 was
    primarily related to consideration paid for acquisitions in
    excess of net assets acquired of $77 million and accounting
    for foreign currency translation.

We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual,
    fourth quarter goodwill impairment tests in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
    Additionally, we did not encounter any events or changes in
    circumstances that indicated that an impairment was more likely
    than not during interim periods in 2010, 2009 or 2008. However,
    there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at

    U.S.$212 million under our Canadian credit facility and
    $147 million of 7.65% senior notes that mature in

    the United States, this debt must be classified as current
    unless we have the intent and ability to refinance it on a
    long-term basis. We have the intent and ability to refinance
    $674 million of this debt on a long-term basis. We have
    classified the remaining $233 million as current
    obligations as of December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, we also have $565 million of
    variable-rate tax-exempt bonds and $46 million of
    variable-rate tax-exempt project bonds. The interest rates on
    these bonds are reset on either a daily or weekly basis through
    a remarketing process. If the remarketing agent is unable to
    remarket the bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to
    us. These bonds are supported by letters of credit guaranteeing
    repayment of the bonds in this event. We classified these
    borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 2010 because the borrowings are supported by
    letters of credit issued under our three-year, $2.0 billion
    revolving credit facility, which is long-term.

Access
    to and Utilization of Credit Facilities

Revolving Credit Facility

— In June 2010, we
    entered into a three-year, $2.0 billion revolving credit
    facility, replacing the $2.4 billion credit facility that
    would have matured in August 2011. This facility provides us
    with credit capacity to be used for either cash borrowings or to
    support letters of credit. At December 31, 2010, we had no



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

outstanding borrowings and $1,138 million of letters of
    credit issued and supported by the facility. The unused and
    available credit capacity of the facility was $862 million
    as of December 31, 2010.

Letter of Credit Facilities

— As of
    December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate committed capacity
    of $505 million under letter of credit facilities with
    maturities that extend from June 2013 to June 2015. These
    facilities are currently being used to back letters of credit
    issued to support our bonding and financial assurance needs. Our
    letters of credit generally have terms providing for automatic
    renewal after one year. In the event of an unreimbursed draw on
    a letter of credit, the amount of the draw paid by the letter of
    credit provider generally converts into a term loan for the
    remaining term of the respective facility. Through
    December 31, 2010, we had not experienced any unreimbursed
    draws on letters of credit under these facilities. As of
    December 31, 2010, no borrowings were outstanding under
    these letter of credit facilities and we had no unused or
    available credit capacity.

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
    Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, entered into a credit facility agreement to
    facilitate WM’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and
    capital from its Canadian subsidiaries. As of December 31,
    2010, the agreement provides available credit capacity of up to
    C$340 million and matures in November 2012.

As of December 31, 2010, we had U.S.$216 million of
    principal (U.S.$212 million net of discount) outstanding
    under this credit facility. The proceeds we initially received
    represented the net present value of the principal amount of the
    advances based on the term outstanding, and the debt was
    initially recorded based on the net proceeds received. The
    advances have a weighted average effective interest rate of 2.2%
    at December 31, 2010, which is being amortized to interest
    expense with a corresponding increase in our recorded debt
    obligation using the effective interest method. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, we increased the carrying value of
    the debt for the recognition of U.S.$3 million of interest
    expense. A total of U.S.$56 million of net advances under
    the facility matured during 2010 and were repaid with available
    cash. Accounting for changes in the Canadian currency
    translation rate increased the carrying value of these
    borrowings by U.S.$10 million during 2010.

Debt
    Borrowings and Repayments

The significant changes in our debt balances from
    December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 are related to
    the following:

Senior Notes

— In June 2010, we issued
    $600 million of 4.75% senior notes due June 2020. The
    net proceeds from the debt issuance were $592 million. We
    used the proceeds together with cash on hand to repay
    $600 million of 7.375% senior notes that matured in
    August 2010.

The remaining change in the carrying value of our senior notes
    from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 is
    principally due to accounting for our

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap agreements, which are accounted for as fair
    value hedges resulting in all fair value adjustments being
    reflected as a component of the carrying value of the underlying
    debt. For additional information regarding our interest rate
    derivatives, refer to Note 8.

Tax-Exempt Bonds

— Tax-exempt bonds are used as
    a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital
    expenditures. The proceeds from these debt issuances may only be
    used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised,
    which is generally to finance expenditures for landfill
    construction and development, equipment, vehicles and facilities
    in support of our operations. Proceeds from bond issues are held
    in trust until such time as we incur qualified expenditures, at
    which time we are reimbursed from the trust funds. During the
    year ended December 31, 2010, $52 million of our
    tax-exempt bonds were repaid with available cash.

Tax-Exempt Project Bonds

— Tax-exempt project
    bonds have been used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the
    development of

waste-to-energy

facilities. These facilities are integral to the local
    communities they serve, and, as such, are supported by long-term
    contracts with multiple municipalities. The bonds generally have
    periodic amortizations that are supported by the cash flow of
    each specific facility being financed. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, we repaid $39 million of our
    tax-exempt project bonds with available cash.

Capital Leases and Other

— The significant
    increase in our capital leases and other debt obligations in
    2010 is primarily related to our federal low-income housing
    investment discussed in Note 9, which increased our debt



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligations by $215 million. This increase was offset by
    $49 million of repayments of various borrowings at their
    scheduled maturities.

Scheduled Debt and Capital Lease Payments

—
    Scheduled debt and capital lease payments for the next five
    years are as follows: $511 million in 2011; $614 million in
    2012; $203 million in 2013; $459 million in 2014; and
    $452 million in 2015. Our recorded debt and capital lease
    obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with
    discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate
    hedging activities, which have been excluded from these amounts
    because they will not result in cash payments.

Secured
    Debt

Our debt balances are generally unsecured, except for
    $30 million of the tax-exempt project bonds outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 that were issued by certain subsidiaries
    within our Wheelabrator Group. These bonds are secured by the
    related subsidiaries’ assets, which have a carrying value
    of $295 million, and the related subsidiaries’ future
    revenue.

Debt
    Covenants

Our revolving credit facility and certain other financing
    agreements contain financial covenants. The most restrictive of
    these financial covenants are contained in our revolving credit
    facility. The following table summarizes the requirements of
    these financial covenants, as defined by the revolving credit
    facility:

Interest coverage ratio

> 2.75 to 1

Total debt to EBITDA

< 3.5 to 1

Our revolving credit facility and senior notes also contain
    certain restrictions intended to monitor our level of
    indebtedness, types of investments and net worth. We monitor our
    compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they
    significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or
    financing arrangements typical for our business. As of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we were in
    compliance with the covenants and restrictions under all of our
    debt agreements.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

We use interest rate swaps to maintain a portion of our debt
    obligations at variable market interest rates. As of
    December 31, 2010, we had approximately $5.4 billion
    in fixed-rate senior notes outstanding. The interest payments on
    $500 million, or 9%, of these senior notes have been
    swapped to variable interest rates to protect the debt against
    changes in fair value due to changes in benchmark interest
    rates. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $5.4 billion in fixed-rate senior notes outstanding, of
    which $1.1 billion, or 20%, had been swapped to variable
    interest rates. The significant terms of our interest rate swap
    agreements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are summarized
    in the table below (in millions):

The decrease in the notional amount of our interest rate swaps

    the scheduled maturity of interest rate swaps with a notional
    amount of $600 million in August 2010.

We have designated our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges
    of our fixed-rate senior notes. Fair value hedge accounting for
    interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of
    debt instruments by $79 million as of December 31,
    2010 and $91 million as of December 31, 2009. The

(a)

These amounts represent the net of our periodic variable-rate
    interest obligations and the swap counterparties’
    fixed-rate interest obligations. The significant decline in the
    benefit from active swaps when comparing 2010 with 2009 is due
    to a decrease in the notional amount of swaps outstanding,
    offset, in part, by a decline in three-month LIBOR rates. The
    increase in the benefit from active swaps from 2008 to 2009 is
    due to a significant decline in three-month LIBOR rates.

(b)

In 2008, this amount included a $10 million net reduction
    in interest expense associated with the early retirement of
    $244 million of 8.75% senior notes. At
    December 31, 2010, $12 million (on a pre-tax basis) of
    the carrying value of debt associated with terminated swap
    agreements is scheduled to be reclassified as a reduction to
    interest expense over the next twelve months.

Treasury
    Rate Locks

During the third quarter of 2009, we entered into Treasury rate
    locks with a total notional amount of $200 million to hedge
    the risk of changes in semi-annual interest payments for a
    portion of the senior notes that the Company planned to issue in
    June 2010. The Treasury rate locks were terminated in the second
    quarter of 2010 contemporaneously with the actual issuance of
    senior notes, and we paid cash of $7 million upon
    settlement. In 2009, we recognized pre-tax and after-tax gains
    of $4 million and $2 million, respectively, to other
    comprehensive income for changes in the fair value of these
    Treasury rate locks. In 2010, we recognized pre-tax and
    after-tax losses of $11 million and $7 million,
    respectively, to other comprehensive income for changes in the
    fair value of these Treasury rate locks. There was no
    significant ineffectiveness associated with these hedges during
    2009 or 2010.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” included $16 million and
    $14 million, respectively, of deferred losses, net of taxes
    associated with the Treasury rate locks mentioned above and with
    Treasury rate locks that had been executed in previous years in
    anticipation of senior note issuances. These deferred losses are
    reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related
    senior note issuances, which extend through 2032. Pre-tax
    amounts of $8 million, $9 million and $6 million
    were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income
    and into interest expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    As of December 31, 2010, $7 million (on a pre-tax
    basis) is scheduled to be reclassified into interest expense
    over the next twelve months.

Forward-Starting
    Interest Rate Swaps

The Company currently expects to issue fixed-rate debt in March
    2011, November 2012 and March 2014 and has executed
    forward-starting interest rate swaps for these anticipated debt
    issuances with notional amounts of $150 million,
    $200 million and $175 million, respectively. We
    entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps during the
    fourth quarter of 2009 to hedge the risk of changes in the
    anticipated semi-annual interest payments due to fluctuations in
    the forward ten-year LIBOR swap rate. Each of the
    forward-starting swaps has an effective date of the anticipated
    date of debt issuance and a tenor of ten years.

We have designated our forward-starting interest rate swaps as
    cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value
    of these interest rate derivatives is comprised of
    $11 million of current liabilities and $13 million of
    long-term liabilities. We recognized pre-tax and after-tax
    losses of $33 million and $20 million, respectively,
    to other comprehensive income for changes in the fair value of
    our forward-starting interest rate swaps during the year ended
    December 31, 2010. There was no ineffectiveness associated
    with these hedges during the year ended December 31,

2010. The reclassification of deferred losses into earnings will
    begin when related forecasted senior note issuances occur and
    will continue over the life of the related senior note
    issuances, which are expected to extend through 2024.

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of these interest
    rate derivatives was comprised of $9 million of long-term
    assets. We recognized pre-tax and after-tax gains of
    $9 million and $5 million, respectively, to other
    comprehensive income for changes in the fair value of our
    forward-starting interest rate swaps during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. There was no ineffectiveness associated
    with these hedges during the year ended December 31, 2009.

Credit-Risk
    Features

Certain of our interest rate derivative instruments contain
    provisions related to the Company’s credit rating. If the
    Company’s credit rating were to fall to specified levels
    below investment grade, the counterparties have the ability to
    terminate the derivative agreements, resulting in immediate
    settlement of all affected transactions. As of December 31,
    2010, we had not experienced any credit events that would
    trigger these provisions. The net liabilities of our derivative
    instruments with credit-risk-related features were immaterial as
    of December 31, 2010.

Foreign
    Exchange Derivatives

We use foreign currency exchange rate derivatives to hedge our
    exposure to changes in exchange rates for anticipated
    intercompany cash transactions between WM Holdings and its
    Canadian subsidiaries. We had foreign currency forward contracts
    outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 for
    anticipated cash flows associated with outstanding debt
    arrangements with these wholly-owned subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2009, the hedged cash flows included
    C$370 million of principal payments and C$22 million
    of interest payments scheduled for December 31, 2010. The
    intercompany note and related forward contracts matured as
    scheduled in December 2010 and we paid cash of $37 million
    to settle the forward contracts.

In December 2010, we also executed a new C$370 million
    intercompany debt arrangement and entered into new forward
    contracts for the related principal and interest cash flows. The
    total notional value of the forward contracts is
    C$401 million. Scheduled interest payments are as follows:
    C$10 million on November 30, 2011, C$11 million
    on November 30, 2012 and C$10 million on
    October 31, 2013. The principal is scheduled to be repaid
    on October 31, 2013. We designated these forward contracts
    as cash flow hedges.

Gains or losses on the underlying hedged items attributable to
    foreign currency exchange risk are recognized in current
    earnings. We include gains and losses on our foreign currency
    forward contracts as adjustments to other income and expense,
    which is the same financial statement line item where offsetting
    gains and losses on the related hedged items are recorded. The
    following table summarizes the pre-tax impacts of our foreign
    currency cash flow derivatives on our results of operations and

Electricity
    Commodity Derivatives

As a result of the expiration of certain long-term, above-market
    electricity contracts at our

waste-to-energy

facilities, we use short-term “receive fixed, pay
    variable” electricity commodity swaps to mitigate the
    variability in our revenues and cash flows caused by
    fluctuations in the market prices for electricity. The swaps
    executed in 2010 hedged 672,360 megawatt hours, or approximately
    26%, of our Wheelabrator Group’s 2010 merchant electricity
    sales and are expected to hedge about 1 million megawatt
    hours, or 33%, of the Group’s 2011 merchant electricity
    sales. There was no significant ineffectiveness associated with
    these cash flow hedges during 2010. All financial statement
    impacts associated with these derivatives were immaterial for

Tax Audit Settlements

— The Company and its
    subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States,
    Canada and Puerto Rico, as well as various state and local
    jurisdictions. We are currently under audit by the IRS and from
    time to time we are audited by other taxing authorities. Our
    audits are in various stages of completion.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we effectively settled an IRS
    audit for the 2009 tax year as well as various state tax audits.
    In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, we finalized
    audits in Canada through 2005. The settlement of these tax
    audits resulted in a reduction to our “Provision for income
    taxes” of $8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for
    the year ended December 31, 2010.

During 2009, we settled the IRS audit for the 2008 tax year as
    well as various state tax audits. The settlement of these tax
    audits resulted in a reduction to our “Provision for income
    taxes” of $11 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

During 2008, we settled IRS audits for the 2006 and 2007 tax
    years as well as various state tax audits. In addition, we
    settled the majority of the issues with respect to Canadian
    audits for the tax years 2002 through 2005. The settlement of
    these tax audits resulted in a reduction to our “Provision
    for income taxes” of $26 million, or $0.05 per diluted
    share, for the year ended December 31, 2008.

We are currently in the examination phase of IRS audits for the
    tax years 2010 and 2011 and expect these audits to be completed
    within the next 12 and 24 months, respectively. We
    participate in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Program,
    which means we work with the IRS throughout the year in order to
    resolve any material issues prior to the filing of our year-end
    tax return. We are also currently undergoing audits by various
    state and local jurisdictions that date back to 2000. In the
    third quarter of 2010, we finalized audits in Canada through the
    2005 tax year and are not currently under audit for any
    subsequent tax years.

Effective State Tax Rate Change

— During 2010,
    our current state tax rate increased from 6.25% to 6.75%
    resulting in an increase to our provision for income taxes of
    $5 million. In addition, our state deferred income taxes
    increased $37 million to reflect the impact of changes in
    the estimated tax rate at which existing temporary differences
    will be realized. During 2009, our current state tax rate
    increased from 6.0% to 6.25% and our deferred state tax rate
    increased from 5.5% to 5.75%, resulting in an increase to our
    income taxes of $3 million and $6 million,
    respectively. During 2008, our current state tax rate increased
    from 5.5% to 6.0%, resulting in an increase to our income taxes
    of $5 million. The increases in these rates are primarily
    due to changes in state law. The comparison of our effective
    state tax rate during the reported periods has also been
    affected by

return-to-accrual

adjustments, which increased our “Provision for income
    taxes” in 2010 and reduced our “Provision for income
    taxes” in 2009 and 2008.

Canada Statutory Tax Rate Change

— During 2009,
    the provincial tax rates in Ontario were reduced, which resulted
    in a $13 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation
    of the related deferred tax balances.

State Net Operating Loss and Credit
    Carry-Forwards

— During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we
    released state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards
    resulting in a reduction to our “Provision for income
    taxes” for those periods of $4 million,
    $35 million and $3 million, respectively.

Capital Loss Carry-Back

— During 2009, we
    generated a capital loss from the liquidation of a foreign
    subsidiary. We determined that the capital loss could be
    utilized to offset capital gains from 2006 and 2007, which
    resulted in a reduction to our 2009 “Provision for income
    taxes” of $65 million.

Federal Low-income Housing Tax Credits

— In
    April 2010, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited
    liability company established to invest in and manage low-income
    housing properties. Our consideration for this investment
    totaled $221 million, which was comprised of a
    $215 million note payable and an initial cash payment of
    $6 million. The entity’s low-income housing
    investments qualify for federal tax credits that are expected to
    be realized through 2020 in accordance with Section 42 of
    the Internal Revenue Code.

We account for our investment in this entity using the equity
    method of accounting, and we recognize a charge to “Equity
    in net losses of unconsolidated entities,” within our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations, for reductions in the
    value of our investment. The value of our investment decreases
    as the tax credits are generated and utilized. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a total of
    $19 million of losses for reductions in the value of our
    investment. We also recognized $5 million of interest
    expense related to this investment during 2010. However, our tax
    provision for the year ended December 31, 2010 was reduced
    by $26 million (including $16 million of tax credits)
    as a result of this investment, which more than offset the
    pre-tax expense realized during the period.

Unremitted Earnings in Foreign Subsidiaries

—
    At December 31, 2010, remaining unremitted earnings in
    foreign operations were approximately $644 million, which
    are considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision
    for U.S. income taxes has been accrued for these unremitted
    earnings.

Deferred
    Tax Assets (Liabilities)

The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at
    December 31 are as follows (in millions):

At December 31, 2010, we had $27 million of federal
    net operating loss, or NOL, carry-forwards and $1.3 billion
    of state NOL carry-forwards. The federal and state NOL
    carry-forwards have expiration dates through the year 2030. We
    also have a $76 million capital loss carry-forward that
    expires in 2014. In addition, we have $39 million of state
    tax credit carry-forwards at December 31, 2010.

We have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in
    realizing the benefit of certain tax loss and credit
    carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. While we expect to
    realize the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation
    allowances, changes in estimates of future taxable income or in
    tax laws may alter this expectation. The valuation allowance
    decreased $7 million in 2010 due to changes in our gross
    deferred tax assets due to changes in state NOL and credit
    carry-forwards.

Liabilities

These liabilities are primarily included as a component of
    long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets because the Company generally does not anticipate
    that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash
    within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2010,
    $35 million of net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized
    in future periods, would impact our effective tax rate.

We recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in tax expense. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we recognized
    approximately $3 million, $4 million and
    $4 million, respectively, of such interest expense as a
    component of our “Provision for income taxes.” We had
    approximately $8 million and $11 million of accrued
    interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We do not have
    any accrued liabilities or expense for penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008.

We anticipate that approximately $9 million of liabilities
    for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and
    $3 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed
    within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals are
    related to state tax items, none of which are material, and are
    expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of
    the applicable statute of limitations period.

Legislation updates —

The Small Business
    Jobs Act, signed into law in September 2010, contains a tax
    incentive package that includes a one-year extension through
    2010 of the 50 percent bonus, or accelerated, depreciation
    provision first enacted in 2008 and subsequently renewed in
    2009. The provision had expired at the end of 2009. Under the
    bonus depreciation provision, 50 percent of the basis of
    qualified capital expenditures may be deducted in the year the
    property is placed in service and the remaining 50 percent
    deducted under normal depreciation rules. The acceleration of
    deductions on 2010 capital expenditures resulting from the bonus
    depreciation provision had no impact on our effective tax rate.
    However, the ability to accelerate depreciation deductions did
    decrease our 2010 cash taxes by $60 million. Taking the
    accelerated tax depreciation will result in increased cash taxes
    in future periods when the accelerated deductions for these
    capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken.

In addition, new tax law signed on December 17, 2010
    includes an extension of the bonus depreciation allowance
    through the end of 2011, and increases the amount of qualifying
    capital expenditures that can be depreciated immediately from
    50 percent to 100 percent. The 100 percent
    depreciation deduction applies to qualifying property placed in
    service between September 8, 2010 and December 31,
    2011.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plans —

Our Waste
    Management retirement savings plans are 401(k) plans that cover
    employees, except those working subject to collective bargaining
    agreements that do not allow for coverage under such plans.
    Employees are generally eligible to participate in the plans
    following a

90-day

waiting period after hire



WASTE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and may contribute as much as 25% of their annual compensation,
    subject to annual contribution limitations established by the
    IRS. Under our largest retirement savings plan, we match, in
    cash, 100% of employee contributions on the first 3% of their
    eligible compensation and match 50% of employee contributions on
    the next 3% of their eligible compensation, resulting in a
    maximum match of 4.5%. Both employee and Company contributions
    vest immediately. Charges to “Operating” and
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses for our
    defined contribution plans were $55 million in 2010,
    $50 million in 2009 and $59 million in 2008.

Defined Benefit Plans —

Certain of the
    Company’s subsidiaries sponsor pension plans that cover
    employees not otherwise covered by the Waste Management
    retirement savings plans. These employees are members of
    collective bargaining units. In addition, Wheelabrator
    Technologies Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, sponsors a pension
    plan for its former executives and former Board members. As of
    December 31, 2010, the combined benefit obligation of these
    pension plans was $81 million, and the plans had
    $60 million of plan assets, resulting in an unfunded
    benefit obligation for these plans of $21 million.

In addition, WM Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries
    provided post-retirement health care and other benefits to
    eligible employees. In conjunction with our acquisition of
    WM Holdings in July 1998, we limited participation in these
    plans to participating retired employees as of December 31,
    1998. The unfunded benefit obligation for these plans was
    $45 million at December 31, 2010.

Our accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension
    and other post-retirement plans are $66 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and are included as components of
    “Accrued liabilities” and long-term “Other
    liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed
    multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for employees who
    participate in collective bargaining agreements. Contributions
    of $35 million in 2010, $34 million in 2009 and
    $35 million in 2008 were charged to operations for our
    subsidiaries’ ongoing participation in these defined
    benefit plans. Our portion of the projected benefit obligation,
    plan assets and unfunded liability of the multiemployer pension
    plans is not material to our financial position. However, the
    failure of participating employers to remain solvent could
    affect our portion of the plans’ unfunded liability.
    Specific benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not
    negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.

In connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various
    collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate
    for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these
    pension plans. If we elect to withdraw from these plans, we may
    incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded
    vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. As discussed in
    Note 11, in 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized aggregate
    charges of $26 million, $9 million and
    $39 million, respectively, to “Operating”
    expenses for the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from
    multiemployer pension plans.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Financial Instruments

— We have obtained
    letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies and
    have established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to
    support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill
    capping, closure and post-closure requirements, environmental
    remediation, and other obligations. Letters of credit generally
    are supported by our revolving credit facility and other credit
    facilities established for that purpose. These facilities are
    discussed further in Note 7. We obtain surety bonds and
    insurance policies from an entity in which we have a
    noncontrolling financial interest. We also obtain insurance from
    a wholly-owned insurance company, the sole business of which is
    to issue policies for us. In those instances where our use of
    financial assurance from entities we own or have financial
    interests in is not allowed, we have available alternative
    financial assurance mechanisms.

Management does not expect that any claims against or draws on
    these instruments would have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial statements. We have not experienced any
    unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the required financial
    assurance instruments for our current operations. In an ongoing
    effort to mitigate



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

risks of future cost increases and reductions in available
    capacity, we continue to evaluate various options to access
    cost-effective sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance coverage for
    protection of our assets and operations from certain risks
    including automobile liability, general liability, real and
    personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’
    and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and
    other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our
    exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to
    the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy.
    Our exposure, however, could increase if our insurers are unable
    to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation
    insurance programs. For our self-insured retentions, the
    exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including
    incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial
    valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these
    liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss
    development significantly differ from our assumptions used. As
    of December 31, 2010, our general liability insurance
    program carried self-insurance exposures of up to
    $2.5 million per incident and our workers’
    compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures
    of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31,
    2010, our auto liability insurance program included a
    per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to
    additional deductibles of $4.8 million in the
    $5 million to $10 million layer. Self-insurance claims
    reserves acquired as part of our acquisition of WM Holdings
    in July 1998 were discounted at 3.50% at December 31, 2010,
    3.75% at December 31, 2009 and 2.25% at December 31,
    2008. The changes to our net insurance liabilities for the three
    years ended December 31, 2010 are summarized below (in

We currently expect substantially all of our recorded

The Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
    policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive
    liability, often referred to as “Broad Form Side A,”
    and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage, often
    referred to as “Side B.” The Side A policy covers
    directors and officers directly for loss, including defense
    costs, when corporate indemnification is unavailable. Side
    A-only coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the Company,
    as the Company is not insured for any money it advances for
    defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and
    officers.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property,
    environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating Leases

— Rental expense for leased
    properties was $121 million during 2010 and
    $114 million during both 2009 and 2008. Minimum contractual
    payments due for our operating lease obligations are
    $82 million in 2011, $76 million in 2012,
    $62 million in 2013, $51 million in 2014 and
    $40 million in 2015.

Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during
    future periods is significantly less than current year rent
    expense due to short-term leases and because our significant
    lease agreements at landfills have variable terms based either
    on a percentage of revenue or a rate per ton of waste received.

Other
    Commitments

•

Share Repurchases

— In December 2010, we
    entered into plans under SEC

Rule 10b5-1

to effect market purchases of our common stock during the first
    quarter of 2011. See Note 15 for additional information
    related to these arrangements.

•

Fuel Supply

— We have purchase agreements
    expiring at various dates through 2011 that require us to
    purchase minimum amounts of wood waste, anthracite coal waste
    (culm) and conventional fuels at our independent power
    production plants. These fuel supplies are used to produce steam
    that is sold to industrial and commercial users and electricity
    that is sold to electric utilities, which is generally subject
    to the terms and conditions of long-term contracts. Our purchase
    agreements have been established based on the plants’
    anticipated fuel supply needs to meet the demands of our
    customers under these long-term electricity sale contracts.
    Under our fuel supply

take-or-pay

contracts, we are generally obligated to pay for a minimum
    amount of waste or conventional fuel at a stated rate even if
    such quantities are not required in our operations.

•

Disposal

— We have several agreements expiring
    at various dates through 2052 that require us to dispose of a
    minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under
    these

put-or-pay

agreements, we are required to pay for the agreed upon minimum
    volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the
    facilities. We generally fulfill our minimum contractual
    obligations by disposing of volumes collected in the ordinary
    course of business at these disposal facilities.

•

Waste Paper

— We are party to a waste paper
    purchase agreement that requires us to purchase a minimum number
    of tons of waste paper. The cost per ton we pay is based on
    market prices. We currently expect to fulfill our purchase
    obligations by 2013.

•

Royalties

— We have various arrangements that
    require us to make royalty payments to third parties including
    prior land owners, lessors or host communities where our
    operations are located. Our obligations generally are based on
    per ton rates for waste actually received at our transfer
    stations, landfills or

waste-to-energy

facilities.

Our unconditional obligations are established in the ordinary
    course of our business and are structured in a manner that
    provides us with access to important resources at competitive,
    market-driven rates. Our actual future obligations under these
    outstanding agreements are generally quantity driven, and, as a
    result, our associated financial obligations are not fixed as of
    December 31, 2010. For these contracts, we have estimated
    our future obligations based on the current market values of the
    underlying products or services. Our estimated minimum
    obligations for the above-described purchase obligations are
    $85 million in 2011, $84 million in 2012,
    $58 million in 2013, $21 million in 2014 and
    $16 million in 2015. We currently expect the products and
    services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the
    needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect
    these established arrangements to materially impact our future
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following
    guarantee agreements associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2010, WM Holdings has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of WM’s senior indebtedness,
    including its senior notes, revolving credit agreement and
    certain letter of credit facilities, which matures through 2039.
    WM has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the senior
    indebtedness of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

WM Holdings, which matures through 2026. Performance under
    these guarantee agreements would be required if either party
    defaulted on their respective obligations. No additional
    liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees because the
    underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. See Note 23 for further information.

•

WM and WM Holdings have guaranteed the tax-exempt bonds and
    other debt obligations of their subsidiaries. If a subsidiary
    fails to meet its obligations associated with its debt
    agreements as they come due, WM or WM Holdings will be
    required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 for information
    related to the balances and maturities of our tax-exempt bonds.

•

We have guaranteed certain financial obligations of
    unconsolidated entities. The related obligations, which mature
    through 2020, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of December 31, 2010, our maximum future
    payments associated with these guarantees are approximately
    $11 million. We do not believe that it is likely that we
    will be required to perform under these guarantees.

•

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market or
    contractually-determined value of certain homeowners’
    properties that are adjacent to certain of our landfills. These
    guarantee agreements extend over the life of the respective
    landfill. Under these agreements, we would be responsible for
    the difference, if any, between the sale value and the
    guaranteed market or contractually-determined value of the
    homeowners’ properties. Generally, it is not possible to
    determine the contingent obligation associated with these
    guarantees, but we do not believe that these contingent
    obligations will have a material effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

We have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested
    assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of
    our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items
    that are currently recorded as obligations, we do not believe
    that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations
    associated with these indemnities. Additionally, under certain
    of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional
    consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial
    targets are achieved post-closing. For acquisitions completed
    subsequent to January 1, 2009, we have recognized
    liabilities for these contingent obligations based on an
    estimate of the fair value of these contingencies at the time of
    acquisition. For acquisitions completed before January 1,
    2009, the costs associated with any additional consideration
    requirements are accounted for as incurred. Contingent
    obligations related to indemnifications arising from our
    divestitures and contingent consideration provided for by our
    acquisitions are not expected to be material to our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

WM and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial
    and general operating obligations of certain of their
    subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual
    obligations as they come due, the guarantor has an unconditional
    obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has
    been recorded for service, financial or general operating
    guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are
    properly accounted for as costs of operations as services are
    provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No
    additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees
    because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly
    accounted for as operating or capital leases, as appropriate.

We currently do not believe it is reasonably likely that we
    would be called upon to perform under these guarantees and do
    not believe that any of the obligations would have a material
    effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Environmental Matters

— A significant portion
    of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be
    characterized as costs of environmental protection, as we are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
    that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to
    remediation activity required by state or local authorities,
    such liabilities include PRP investigations.



WASTE

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The costs associated with these liabilities can include
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as
    incremental internal and external costs directly associated with
    site investigation and

clean-up.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation is
    inherently difficult. We recognize and accrue for an estimated
    remediation liability when we determine that such liability is
    both probable and reasonably estimable. Determining the method
    and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number of
    assumptions be made. There can sometimes be a range of
    reasonable estimates of the costs associated with the
    investigation of the extent of environmental impact and
    identification of likely site-remediation alternatives. In these
    cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our
    best estimate. If no amount within a range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the
    low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges,
    our aggregate potential liability would be approximately
    $150 million higher than the $284 million recorded in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31,
    2010. Our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities, in
    light of relevant internal and external facts and circumstances,
    could result in revisions to our accruals that could cause
    upward or downward adjustments to income from operations. These
    adjustments could be material in any given period.

As of December 31, 2010, we had been notified that we are a
    PRP in connection with 75 locations listed on the EPA’s
    National Priorities List, or NPL. Of the 75 sites at which
    claims have been made against us, 17 are sites we own. Each of
    the NPL sites we own was initially developed by others as a
    landfill disposal facility. At each of these facilities, we are
    working in conjunction with the government to characterize or
    remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed
    with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing
    the costs of remediation or are working toward a cost-sharing
    agreement. We generally expect to receive any amounts due from
    other participating parties at or near the time that we make the
    remedial expenditures. The other 58 NPL sites, which we do not
    own, are at various procedural stages under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
    as amended, known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of these proceedings involve allegations that
    certain of our subsidiaries (or their predecessors) transported
    hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our
    acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for
    liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to
    or disposing at the sites. Proceedings arising under Superfund
    typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste
    transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or
    recover costs associated with site investigation and
    remediation, which costs could be substantial and could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. At some of the sites at which we have been
    identified as a PRP, our liability is well defined as a
    consequence of a governmental decision and an agreement among
    liable parties as to the share each will pay for implementing
    that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has been selected
    or the liable parties have been unable to agree on an
    appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain.

Litigation

— In April 2002, two former
    participants in the ERISA plans of WM Holdings filed a
    lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Columbia in a case entitled

William S. Harris, et al. v.
    James E. Koenig, et al

. The lawsuit named as defendants
    WM Holdings; the members of WM Holdings’ Board of
    Directors prior to July 1998; the administrative and investment
    committees of WM Holdings’ ERISA plans and their
    individual members; WM’s retirement savings plan; the
    investment committees of WM’s plan and its individual
    members; and State Street Bank & Trust, the trustee
    and investment manager of the ERISA plans. The lawsuit attempts
    to increase the recovery of a class of ERISA plan participants
    based on allegations related to both the events alleged in, and
    the settlements relating to, the securities class action against
    WM Holdings that was settled in 1998 and the securities
    class action against WM that was settled in 2001. During the
    second quarter of 2010, the Court dismissed certain claims
    against individual defendants, including all claims against each
    of the current members of our Board of Directors.
    Mr. Simpson, our Chief Financial Officer, is a named
    defendant in these actions by virtue of his membership on the WM
    ERISA plan Investment Committee at that time. Recently,
    plaintiffs dismissed all claims related to the settlement of the
    securities class action against WM that was settled in 2001, and
    the court certified a limited class of participants who may
    bring claims on behalf of the plan, but not individually. All of
    the remaining defendants intend to continue to defend themselves
    vigorously.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Two separate wage and hour lawsuits were commenced in October
    2006 and March 2007, respectively, that are pending against
    certain of our subsidiaries in California, each seeking class
    certification. The actions were coordinated to proceed in
    San Diego County Superior Court. Both lawsuits make the
    same general allegations that the defendants failed to comply
    with certain California wage and hour laws, including allegedly
    failing to provide meal and rest periods and failing to properly
    pay hourly and overtime wages. We have executed a settlement
    agreement in connection with this matter; however, such
    settlement remains subject to final court approval and other
    contingencies.

Additionally, in July 2008, we were named as a defendant in a
    purported class action in the Circuit Court of Bullock County,
    Alabama, which was subsequently removed to the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. This suit
    pertains to our fuel and environmental charge and generally
    alleges that such charges were not properly disclosed, were
    unfair, and were contrary to contract. We filed a motion to
    dismiss that was partially granted during the third quarter of
    2010, resulting in dismissal of the plaintiffs’ RICO and
    national class action claims. We deny the claims in all of these
    actions and intend to continue to oppose class certification and
    will vigorously defend these matters. Given the inherent
    uncertainties of litigation, the ultimate outcome of these cases
    cannot be predicted at this time, nor can possible damages, if
    any, be reasonably estimated.

From time to time, we also are named as defendants in personal
    injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class
    actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported
    waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have
    contaminated the environment or, in certain cases, on the basis
    of having conducted environmental remediation activities at
    sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of
    monitoring of allegedly affected sites and health care
    examinations of allegedly affected persons for a substantial
    period of time even where no actual damage is proven. While we
    believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, the
    ultimate resolution is often substantially uncertain due to the
    difficulty of determining the cause, extent and impact of
    alleged contamination (which may have occurred over a long
    period of time), the potential for successive groups of
    complainants to emerge, the diversity of the individual
    plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential contribution
    or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or other third
    parties, among other factors.

As a large company with operations across the United States and
    Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits,
    disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our
    business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal
    issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against
    us include commercial, customer, and employment-related claims,
    including, as noted above, purported class action lawsuits
    related to our customer service agreements and purported class
    actions involving federal and state wage and hour and other
    laws. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or
    injunctive relief, or both. These actions are in various
    procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We
    currently do not believe that any such actions will ultimately
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

WM’s charter and bylaws require indemnification of its
    officers and directors if statutory standards of conduct have
    been met and allow the advancement of expenses to these
    individuals upon receipt of an undertaking by the individuals to
    repay all expenses if it is ultimately determined that they did
    not meet the required standards of conduct. Additionally, WM has
    entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of
    the members of its Board of Directors as well as its President
    and Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer.
    The Company may incur substantial expenses in connection with
    the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and indemnification
    obligations in connection with current actions involving former
    officers of the Company or its subsidiaries or other actions or
    proceedings that may be brought against its former or current
    officers, directors and employees.

Item 103 of the SEC’s

Regulation S-K

requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a
    governmental authority is a party to the proceedings, or such
    proceedings are known to be contemplated, unless we reasonably

interest and costs, of less than $100,000. The following matters
    pending as of December 31, 2010 are disclosed in accordance
    with that requirement:

On April 4, 2006, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation
    (“NOV”) to Waste Management of Hawaii, Inc., an
    indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WM, and to the City and
    County of Honolulu for alleged violations of the federal Clean
    Air Act, based on alleged failure to submit certain reports and
    design plans required by the EPA, and the failure to begin and
    timely complete the installation of a gas collection and control
    system (“GCCS”) for the Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary
    Landfill on Oahu. The EPA has also indicated that it will seek
    penalties and injunctive relief as part of the NOV enforcement
    for elevated landfill temperatures that were recorded after
    installation of the GCCS. The parties have been in confidential
    settlement negotiations. Pursuant to an indemnity agreement, any
    penalty assessed will be paid by the Company, and not by the
    City and County of Honolulu.

The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office has commenced
    investigations into allegations of violations of the Clean Air
    Act, the Clean Water Act, solid waste regulations and permits at
    Wheelabrator Group facilities in Saugus and North Andover,
    Massachusetts. The Attorney General’s Office is also
    considering intervening in two private lawsuits alleging
    potential claims under the Massachusetts False Claims Act. No
    formal enforcement action has been brought against the Company,
    although we potentially could be subject to sanctions, including
    requirements to pay monetary penalties. We are cooperating with
    the Attorney General’s office in the investigations.

Multiemployer, Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—
    Over 20% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining
    agreements, which are with various union locals across the
    United States. As a result of some of these agreements, certain
    of our subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of
    trustee-managed multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for
    the affected employees. One of the most significant
    multiemployer pension plans in which we participate is the
    Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan
    (“Central States Pension Plan”), which has reported
    that it adopted a rehabilitation plan as a result of its
    actuarial certification for the plan year beginning
    January 1, 2008. The Central States Pension Plan is in
    “critical status,” as defined by the Pension
    Protection Act of 2006.

In connection with our ongoing renegotiation of various
    collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate
    for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these
    pension plans. We recognized charges to “Operating”
    expenses of $26 million in 2010, $9 million in 2009
    and $39 million in 2008 associated with the withdrawal of
    certain bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension
    plans. Our partial withdrawal from the Central States Pension
    Plan accounted for all of our 2010 charges and $35 million
    of our 2008 charges. We are still negotiating and litigating
    final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for these previous
    withdrawals, which could be materially higher than the charges
    we have recognized. We do not believe that our withdrawals from
    the multiemployer plans, individually or in the aggregate, will
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
    liquidity. However, depending on the number of employees
    withdrawn in any future period and the financial condition of
    the multiemployer plans at the time of withdrawal, such
    withdrawals could materially affect our results of operations in
    the period of the withdrawal.

Tax Matters

— We are currently in the
    examination phase of IRS audits for the tax years 2010 and 2011
    and expect these audits to be completed within the next 12 and
    24 months, respectively. We participate in the IRS’s
    Compliance Assurance Program, which means we work with the IRS
    throughout the year in order to resolve any material issues
    prior to the filing of our year-end tax return. We are also
    currently undergoing audits by various state and local
    jurisdictions that date back to 2000. In the third quarter of
    2010, we finalized audits in Canada through the 2005 tax year
    and are not currently under audit for any subsequent tax years.
    To provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain a
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the balance of which
    management believes is adequate. Results of audit assessments by
    taxing authorities are not currently expected to have a material
    adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

Restructuring

2009 Restructuring —

In January 2009, we took
    steps to further streamline our organization by
    (i) consolidating many of our Market Areas;
    (ii) integrating the management of our recycling operations
    with our other solid



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

waste business; and (iii) realigning our Corporate
    organization with this new structure in order to provide support
    functions more efficiently.

Our principal operations are managed through our Groups, which
    are discussed in Note 21. Each of our four geographic
    Groups had been further divided into 45 Market Areas. As a
    result of our restructuring, the Market Areas were consolidated
    into 25 Areas. We found that our larger Market Areas generally
    were able to achieve efficiencies through economies of scale
    that were not present in our smaller Market Areas, and this
    reorganization has allowed us to lower costs and to continue to
    standardize processes and improve productivity. In addition,
    during the first quarter of 2009, responsibility for the
    oversight of

day-to-day

recycling operations at our material recovery facilities and
    secondary processing facilities was transferred from our Waste
    Management Recycle America, or WMRA, organization to our four
    geographic Groups. By integrating the management of our
    recycling facilities’ operations with our other solid waste
    business, we are able to more efficiently provide comprehensive
    environmental solutions to our customers. In addition, as a
    result of this realignment, we have significantly reduced the
    overhead costs associated with managing this portion of our
    business and have increased the geographic Groups’ focus on
    maximizing the profitability and return on invested capital of
    our business on an integrated basis.

This reorganization eliminated over 1,500 employee
    positions throughout the Company. During 2009, we recognized
    $50 million of pre-tax charges associated with this
    restructuring, of which $41 million were related to
    employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were
    primarily related to operating lease obligations for property
    that will no longer be utilized. The following table summarizes
    the charges recognized in 2009 for this restructuring by each of
    our reportable segments and our Corporate and Other
    organizations (in millions):

In 2010, we recognized $2 million of income related to the

    severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of this
    restructuring.

2008 Restructuring —

The $2 million of
    restructuring expenses recognized during 2008 was related to a
    reorganization of customer service functions in our Western
    Group and the realignment of certain operations in our Southern
    Group.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Income from Divestitures

— The net gain from
    divestitures during 2008 was a result of our focus on selling
    underperforming businesses and primarily related to the
    divestiture of underperforming collection operations in our
    Southern Group.

Asset Impairments

— Through December 31,
    2008, we capitalized $70 million of accumulated costs
    associated with the development of a new waste and recycling
    revenue management system. A significant portion of these costs
    was specifically associated with the purchase of a license for
    waste and recycling revenue management software and the efforts
    required to develop and configure that software for our use.
    After a failed pilot implementation of the software in one of
    our smallest Market Areas, the development efforts associated
    with the revenue management system were suspended in 2007.
    During 2009, we determined to enhance and improve our existing
    revenue management system and not pursue alternatives associated
    with the development and implementation of the licensed
    software. Accordingly, in 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge
    of $51 million, $49 million of which was recognized
    during the first quarter of 2009 and $2 million of which
    was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2009, for the
    abandonment of the licensed software.

We recognized an additional $32 million of impairment
    charges during 2009, $27 million of which was recognized by
    our Western Group during the fourth quarter of 2009 to fully
    impair a landfill in California as a result of a change in our
    expectations for the future operations of the landfill. The
    remaining impairment charges were primarily attributable to a
    charge required to write down certain of our investments in
    portable self-storage operations to their fair value as a result
    of our acquisition of a controlling financial interest in those
    operations.

During 2008, we recognized a $4 million impairment charge,
    primarily as a result of a decision to close a landfill in our
    Southern Group.

Other

— We filed a lawsuit in March 2008
    related to the revenue management software implementation that
    was suspended in 2007 and abandoned in 2009. In April 2010, we
    settled the lawsuit and received a one-time cash payment. The
    settlement resulted in an increase in income from operations for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 of $77 million.

In July 2008, we suspended our share repurchases in connection
    with a proposed acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we
    determined that, given the state of the economy and the
    financial markets, it would be prudent to suspend repurchases
    for the foreseeable future. In June 2009, we decided that the
    improvement in the capital markets and the economic environment
    supported a decision to resume repurchases of our common stock
    during the second half of 2009.

Our Board of Directors approved a capital allocation program for
    2010 that included the authorization for expenditures of up to
    $1.3 billion, comprised of approximately $615 million
    in cash dividends and up to $685 million in common stock
    repurchases. All of the common stock repurchases in 2010 were
    made pursuant to this capital allocation program. In December
    2010, the Board of Directors approved up to $575 million in
    share repurchases for 2011 and we entered into plans under SEC

Rule 10b5-1

to effect market purchases of our common stock in the first
    quarter of 2011. We repurchased approximately $26 million
    of our common stock pursuant to these plans, through
    February 14, 2011.

Future share repurchases will be made within the limits approved
    by our Board of Directors at the discretion of management, and
    will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board
    in making dividend declarations.

Dividends

Our quarterly dividends have been declared by our Board of
    Directors and paid in accordance with our capital allocation
    programs. Cash dividends declared and paid were
    $604 million in 2010, or $1.26 per common share,
    $569 million in 2009, or $1.16 per common share and
    $531 million in 2008, or $1.08 per common share.

In December 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors
    expects to increase the per share quarterly dividend from $0.315
    to $0.34 for dividends declared in 2011. However, all future
    dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net
    earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business
    plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant.

16.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which employees
    that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase
    shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for
    two offering periods for purchases: January through June and
    July through December. At the end of each offering period,
    employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a
    price equal to 85% of the lesser of the market value of the
    stock on the first and last day of such offering period. The
    purchases are made through payroll deductions, and the number of
    shares that may be purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The
    total number of shares issued under the plan for the offering
    periods in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately
    911,000, 969,000 and 839,000, respectively. Including the impact
    of the January 2011 issuance of shares associated with the July
    to December 2010 offering period, approximately 1.6 million
    shares remain available for issuance under the plan.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accounting for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan increased annual
    compensation expense by approximately $7 million, or
    $4 million net of tax, for 2010 and by $6 million, or
    $4 million net of tax, for both 2009 and 2008.

Employee
    Stock Incentive Plans

We grant equity and equity-based awards to our officers,
    employees and independent directors. The Company’s 2004
    Stock Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of up to
    34 million shares of our common stock, terminated by its
    terms in May 2009, at which time our stockholders approved our
    2009 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2009 Plan provides for the
    issuance of up to 26.2 million shares of our common stock.
    As of December 31, 2010, approximately 16.0 million
    shares remain available for issuance under the 2009 Plan. We
    currently utilize treasury shares to meet the needs of our
    equity-based compensation programs.

Pursuant to the 2009 Plan, we have the ability to issue stock
    options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards, including
    restricted stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and
    performance share units, or PSUs. The terms and conditions of
    equity awards granted under the 2009 Plan are determined by the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board
    of Directors.

The Company grants equity awards to certain key employees as
    part of its long-term incentive plan, or LTIP. The annual LTIP
    awards granted in 2008 and 2009 included a combination of RSUs
    and PSUs. In 2010, we

re-introduced

stock options as a component of equity compensation, and key
    employees were granted a combination of PSUs and stock options.
    Beginning in 2008, the annual LTIP award made to the
    Company’s senior leadership team, which generally includes
    the Company’s executive officers, was comprised solely of
    PSUs. We continued this practice in 2009; however, in 2010, the
    annual LTIP award to the Company’s senior leadership team
    included a combination of PSUs and stock options. During the
    reported periods, the Company has also granted restricted stock
    units and stock options to employees working on key initiatives;
    in connection with new hires and promotions; and to field-based
    managers.

(a)

The total fair market value of the shares issued upon the
    vesting of RSUs during the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 was $14 million, $13 million and
    $11 million, respectively.

RSUs provide award recipients with dividend equivalents during
    the vesting period, but the units may not be voted or sold until
    time-based vesting restrictions have lapsed. RSUs provide for
    three-year cliff vesting. Unvested units are subject to
    forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination.
    RSUs are subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s
    retirement or involuntary termination other than for cause and
    become immediately vested in the event of an employee’s
    death or disability.

Compensation expense associated with RSUs is measured based on
    the grant-date fair value of our common stock and is recognized
    on a straight-line basis over the required employment period,
    which is generally the vesting period. Compensation expense is
    only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which
    we estimate based upon an assessment of current period and
    historical forfeitures.

Performance Share Units —

PSUs are payable in
    shares of common stock after the end of a three-year performance
    period and after the Company’s financial results for the
    entire performance period are reported, typically in mid to late
    February of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance
    period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200%
    of the targeted amount, depending on the Company’s
    performance against pre-established financial targets. A summary

PSUs have no voting rights. Beginning with the PSU awards made
    in 2007, PSUs receive dividend equivalents that are paid out in
    cash based on actual performance at the end of the awards’
    performance period. In the case of the PSUs with the performance
    period ended December 31, 2010 that expired without
    vesting, no dividend equivalents will be paid. PSUs are payable
    to an employee (or his beneficiary) upon death or disability as
    if that employee had remained employed until the end of the
    performance period, are subject to pro-rata vesting upon an
    employee’s retirement or involuntary termination other than
    for cause and are subject to forfeiture in the event of
    voluntary or for-cause termination.

Compensation expense associated with PSUs that continue to vest
    based on future performance is measured based on the grant-date
    fair value of our common stock. Compensation expense is
    recognized ratably over the performance period based on our
    estimated achievement of the established performance criteria.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    both the probability that the performance criteria will be
    achieved and current period and historical forfeitures.

Stock Options —

Prior to 2005, stock options
    were the primary form of equity-based compensation we granted to
    our employees. In 2010, the Management Development and
    Compensation Committee decided to re-introduce stock options as
    a component of our LTIP awards. All of our previously granted
    stock option awards have vested, with the exception of any
    grants pursuant to the reload feature discussed in footnote
    (a) to the table below. The stock options will vest in 25%
    increments on the first two anniversaries of the date of grant
    and the remaining 50% will vest on the third anniversary. The
    exercise price of the options is the fair market value of our
    common stock on the date of grant, and the options have a term
    of 10 years. A summary of our stock options is presented in

shall be entitled to exercise all 2010 stock options outstanding
    and exercisable prior to such termination. All outstanding stock
    options, whether exercisable or not, are forfeited upon
    termination with cause.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value
    method of accounting using a Black-Scholes methodology to
    measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The fair
    value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to
    expense over the vesting period. The following table presents
    the assumptions used to value employee stock options granted
    during the year ended December 31, 2010 under the
    Black-Scholes valuation model:

Expected option life

5.7 years

Expected volatility

24.8%

Expected dividend yield

3.8%

Risk-free interest rate

2.9%

The Company bases its expected option life on the expected
    exercise and termination behavior of its optionees and an
    appropriate model of the Company’s future stock price. The
    expected volatility assumption is derived from the historical
    volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most
    recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of
    the Company’s stock options, combined with other relevant
    factors including implied volatility in market-traded options on
    the Company’s stock. The dividend yield is the annual rate
    of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option as
    of the grant date.

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
    recognized $28 million, $22 million, and
    $42 million, respectively, of compensation expense
    associated with RSU, PSU and stock option awards as a component
    of “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in
    our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our “Provision
    for income taxes” for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 includes related deferred income tax
    benefits of $11 million, $9 million and
    $16 million, respectively. We have not capitalized any
    equity-based compensation costs during the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Compensation expense recognized in 2009 was significantly less
    than expense recognized in 2008 primarily due to the
    Company’s determination that it was no longer probable that
    the targets established for PSUs granted in 2008 would be met.
    Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2009, we recognized an
    adjustment to “Selling, general and administrative”
    expenses for the reversal of all previously recognized
    compensation expense associated with this award. Additionally,
    we did not recognize any compensation expense in 2010 associated
    with the PSUs granted in 2008. These PSUs expired without
    vesting on December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010,
    we estimate that a total of approximately $40 million of
    currently unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized
    in future periods for unvested RSU, PSU and stock option awards
    issued and outstanding. Unrecognized compensation expense
    associated with all unvested awards currently outstanding is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    approximately two years.

Non-Employee
    Director Plans

Our non-employee directors currently receive annual grants of
    shares of our common stock, payable in two equal installments,
    under the 2009 Plan described above. Prior to 2008, our
    directors received deferred stock units and were allowed to
    elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation in the form
    of deferred stock units, to be paid out in shares of our common
    stock at the termination of board service, pursuant to our
    2003 Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan. In late
    2007, each member of the Board of Directors elected to receive
    payment of shares for his deferred stock units at the end of
    December 2008 and recognized taxable income on such payment. The
    Board of Directors terminated the 2003 Directors’ Plan
    in 2009 and, as a result, no shares remain available for
    issuance under that plan.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Assets
    and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value

Authoritative guidance associated with fair value measurements
    provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a
    fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure
    fair value, giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3 inputs).

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring
    the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data
    or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in
    pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk
    when appropriate. Our assets and liabilities that are measured
    at fair value on a recurring basis include the following (in
    millions):

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents are reflected at fair value in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements based upon quoted market prices and consist
    primarily of money market funds that invest in
    U.S. government obligations with original maturities of
    three months or less.

Available-for-Sale

Securities

Available for-sale securities are recorded at fair value based
    on quoted market prices. These assets include restricted trusts
    and escrow accounts invested in money market mutual funds,
    equity-based mutual funds and other equity securities. As
    discussed in Note 20, effective January 1, 2010, we
    deconsolidated the trusts for which power over significant
    activities of the trust is shared, which reduced our restricted
    trust and escrow accounts by $109 million as of
    January 1, 2010. Beginning in 2010, our interests in these
    variable interest entities have been accounted for as
    investments in unconsolidated entities and receivables.

The cost basis of our direct investment in equity securities,
    included as a component of

“Available-for-sale

securities” above, was $2 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The cost basis of investments
    in equity-based mutual funds was $75 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 and is included above as a
    component of “Interest in

available-for-sale

securities of unconsolidated entities” as of
    December 31, 2010, and as a component of

“Available-for-sale

securities” as of December 31, 2009. Unrealized
    holding gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as
    either an increase or decrease to the asset balance and deferred
    as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive
    income” in the equity section of our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The net unrealized holding gains on equity-based mutual
    funds, net of taxes, were $5 million and $2 million as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The net
    unrealized holding losses on equity securities, net of taxes,
    were immaterial as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The fair
    value of our remaining

available-for-sale

securities approximates our cost basis in the investments.

Interest
    Rate Derivatives

As of December 31, 2010, we are party to

(i) fixed-to-floating

interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges of
    our currently outstanding senior notes; and
    (ii) forward-starting interest rate swaps that are
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated interest payments
    for future fixed-rate debt issuances. Our

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps are
    LIBOR-based instruments. Accordingly, these derivatives are
    valued using a third-party pricing model that incorporates
    information about LIBOR yield curves for each instrument’s
    respective term. The third-party pricing model used to value our
    interest rate derivatives also incorporates Company and
    counterparty credit valuation adjustments, as appropriate.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Counterparties to our interest rate derivatives are financial
    institutions who participate in our $2.0 billion revolving
    credit facility. Valuations of our interest rate derivatives may
    fluctuate significantly from

period-to-period

due to volatility in underlying interest rates, which are driven
    by market conditions and the scheduled maturities of the
    derivatives. Refer to Note 8 for additional information
    regarding our interest rate derivatives.

Foreign
    Currency Derivatives

Our foreign currency derivatives are valued using a third-party
    pricing model that incorporates information about forward
    Canadian dollar exchange prices as of the reporting date. The
    third-party pricing model used to value our foreign currency
    derivatives also incorporates Company and counterparty credit
    valuation adjustments, as appropriate. Counterparties to these
    contracts are financial institutions who participate in our
    $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. Valuations may
    fluctuate significantly from

period-to-period

due to volatility in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar
    exchange rate. Refer to Note 8 for additional information
    regarding our foreign currency derivatives.

Fair
    Value of Debt

At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of
    our debt was approximately $8.9 billion. The carrying value
    of our debt includes adjustments for both the unamortized fair
    value adjustments related to terminated hedge arrangements and
    fair value adjustments of debt instruments that are currently
    hedged.

The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately
    $9.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and approximately
    $9.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The estimated fair
    value of our senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The
    carrying value of remarketable debt approximates fair value due
    to the short-term nature of the interest rates. The fair value
    of our other debt is estimated using discounted cash flow
    analysis, based on rates we would currently pay for similar
    types of instruments.

Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts
    using available market information and commonly accepted
    valuation methodologies, considerable judgment is required in
    interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
    Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the
    amounts that we, or holders of the instruments, could realize in
    a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions

and/or

estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the
    estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on
    information available as of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009. These amounts have not been revalued
    since those dates, and current estimates of fair value could
    differ significantly from the amounts presented.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

Acquisitions

We continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are
    accretive to our solid waste operations and enhance and expand
    our existing service offerings. We have seen the greatest
    opportunities for realizing superior returns from tuck-in
    acquisitions, which are primarily the purchases of collection
    operations that enhance our existing route structures and are
    strategically located near our existing disposal operations.

In 2010, we acquired businesses primarily related to our
    collection and

waste-to-energy

operations. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for
    acquisitions was $427 million, which included
    $379 million in cash payments, $20 million in
    contributed assets, a liability for additional cash payments
    with an estimated fair value of $23 million, and assumed
    liabilities of $5 million. The additional cash payments are
    contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of
    certain negotiated goals, which generally included targeted
    revenues. At the date of acquisition, our estimated maximum
    obligations for the contingent cash payments were
    $23 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had paid
    $8 million of this contingent consideration. In 2010, we
    also paid $20 million of contingent consideration
    associated with acquisitions completed in 2009.

The allocation of purchase price was primarily to “Property
    and equipment,” which had an estimated fair value of
    $279 million; “Other intangible assets,” which
    had an estimated fair value of $98 million; and
    “Goodwill” of $77 million. Goodwill is primarily
    a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired
    businesses with our existing operations and is tax deductible.



WASTE

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2009, we acquired businesses primarily related to our
    collection operations. Total consideration, net of cash
    acquired, for acquisitions was $329 million, which included
    $259 million in cash payments, a liability for additional
    cash payments with an estimated fair value of $46 million,
    and assumed liabilities of $24 million. The additional cash
    payments are contingent upon achievement by the acquired
    businesses of certain negotiated goals, which generally included
    targeted revenues. At the date of acquisition, our estimated
    obligations for the contingent cash payments were between
    $42 million and $56 million. As of December 31,
    2009, we had paid $15 million of this contingent
    consideration. In 2009, we also paid $7 million of
    contingent consideration associated with acquisitions completed
    in 2008.

The allocation of purchase price was primarily to “Property
    and equipment,” which had an estimated fair value of
    $102 million; “Other intangible assets,” which
    had an estimated fair value of $105 million; and
    “Goodwill” of $125 million. Goodwill is primarily
    a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired
    businesses with our existing operations and is tax deductible.

Our 2009 acquisitions included the purchase of the remaining
    equity interest in one of our portable self-storage investments,
    increasing our equity interest in this entity from 50% to 100%.
    As a result of this acquisition, we recognized a $4 million
    loss for the remeasurement of the fair value of our initial
    equity investment, which was determined to be $5 million.
    This loss was recognized as a component of “(Income)
    expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual
    items” in our Statement of Operations.

In 2008, we completed several acquisitions for a cost, net of
    cash acquired, of $280 million.

Divestitures

The aggregate sales price for divestitures of operations was
    $1 million in 2010, $1 million in 2009 and
    $59 million in 2008. The proceeds from these sales were
    comprised substantially of cash. We recognized net gains on
    these divestitures of $1 million in 2010 and

Variable
    Interest Entities

Following is a description of our financial interests in
    variable interest entities that we consider significant,
    including (i) those for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary of the entity and, therefore, have
    consolidated the entities into our financial statements; and
    (ii) those that represent a significant interest in an
    unconsolidated entity.

Consolidated
    Variable Interest Entities

Waste-to-Energy

LLCs

— In June 2000, two limited liability
    companies were established to purchase interests in existing
    leveraged lease financings at three

waste-to-energy

facilities that we lease, operate and maintain. We own a 0.5%
    interest in one of the LLCs (“LLC I”) and a 0.25%
    interest in the second LLC (“LLC II”). John Hancock
    Life Insurance Company owns 99.5% of LLC I and 99.75% of LLC II
    is owned by LLC I and the CIT Group. In 2000, Hancock and CIT
    made an initial investment of $167 million in the LLCs,
    which was used to purchase the three

waste-to-energy

facilities and assume the seller’s indebtedness. Under the
    LLC agreements, the LLCs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence
    of any of the following events: (i) a written decision of
    all members of the LLCs; (ii) December 31, 2063;
    (iii) a court’s dissolution of the LLCs; or
    (iv) the LLCs ceasing to own any interest in the

waste-to-energy

facilities.

Income, losses and cash flows of the LLCs are allocated to the
    members based on their initial capital account balances until
    Hancock and CIT achieve targeted returns; thereafter, we will
    receive 80% of the earnings of each of the LLCs and Hancock and
    CIT will be allocated the remaining 20% proportionate to their
    respective equity interests. All capital allocations made
    through December 31, 2010 have been based on initial
    capital account balances as the target returns have not yet been
    achieved.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our obligations associated with our interests in the LLCs are
    primarily related to the lease of the facilities. In addition to
    our minimum lease payment obligations, we are required to make
    cash payments to the LLCs for differences between fair market
    rents and our minimum lease payments. These payments are subject
    to adjustment based on factors that include the fair market
    value of rents for the facilities and lease payments made
    through the

re-measurement

dates. In addition, we may also be required under certain
    circumstances to make capital contributions to the LLCs based on
    differences between the fair market value of the facilities and
    defined termination values as provided for in the underlying
    lease agreements, although we believe the likelihood of the
    occurrence of these circumstances is remote.

We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the
    LLCs and consolidate these entities in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements because (i) all of the equity owners
    of the LLCs are considered related parties for purposes of
    applying this accounting guidance; (ii) the equity owners
    share power over the significant activities of the LLCs; and
    (iii) we are the entity within the related party group
    whose activities are most closely associated with the LLCs.

As of December 31, 2010, our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    includes $319 million of net property and equipment
    associated with the LLCs’

waste-to-energy

facilities and $240 million in noncontrolling interests
    associated with Hancock’s and CIT’s interests in the
    LLCs. As of December 31, 2010, all debt obligations of the
    LLCs have been paid in full and, therefore, the LLCs have no
    liabilities. During the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008, we recognized expense of $50 million,
    $50 million and $41 million, respectively, for
    Hancock’s and CIT’s noncontrolling interests in the
    LLCs’ earnings. The LLCs’ earnings relate to the
    rental income generated from leasing the facilities to our
    subsidiaries, reduced by depreciation expense. The LLCs’
    rental income is eliminated in WM’s consolidation.

Significant
    Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

Trusts for Capping, Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental
    Remediation Obligations

— We have significant
    financial interests in trust funds that were created to settle
    certain of our capping, closure, post-closure or environmental
    remediation obligations. We have determined that we are not the
    primary beneficiary of certain of these trust funds because
    power over the trusts’ significant activities is shared.

The deconsolidation of these variable interest entities as of
    January 1, 2010, in accordance with the new FASB guidance
    discussed in Note 2, decreased our restricted trust and
    escrow accounts by $109 million; increased investments in
    unconsolidated entities by $27 million; increased
    receivables, principally long-term, by $51 million; and
    decreased noncontrolling interests by $31 million.
    Beginning in 2010, our interests in these variable interest
    entities have been accounted for as investments in
    unconsolidated entities and receivables. These amounts are
    recorded in “Other receivables” and as long-term
    “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our
    investments and receivables related to the trusts had a fair
    value of $105 million as of January 1, 2010 and
    $103 million as of December 31, 2010. We continue to
    reflect our interests in the unrealized gains and losses on
    marketable securities held by these trusts as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The deconsolidation of
    these variable interest entities has not materially affected our
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the
    periods presented.

As the party with primary responsibility to fund the related
    capping, closure, post-closure or environmental remediation
    activities, we are exposed to risk of loss as a result of
    potential changes in the fair value of the assets of the trust.
    The fair value of trust assets can fluctuate due to
    (i) changes in the market value of the investments held by
    the trusts; and (ii) credit risk associated with trust
    receivables. Although we are exposed to changes in the fair
    value of the trust assets, we currently expect the trust funds
    to continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they
    were established.

Investment in Federal Low-income Housing Tax
    Credits

— In April 2010, we acquired a
    noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company
    established to invest in and manage low-income housing
    properties. Along with the other equity investor, we support the
    operations of the entity in exchange for a pro-rata share of the
    tax credits it generates. Our target return on the investment is
    guaranteed and, therefore, we do not believe that we have



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

any material exposure to loss. Our consideration for this
    investment totaled $221 million, which was comprised of a
    $215 million note payable and an initial cash payment of
    $6 million. At December 31, 2010, our investment
    balance was $202 million. We determined that we are not the
    primary beneficiary of this entity as we do not have the power
    to direct the entity’s activities. Accordingly, we account
    for this investment under the equity method of accounting and do
    not consolidate the entity. Additional information related to
    this investment is discussed in Note 9.

Basic and diluted earnings per common share for each of the

    average number of common and dilutive potential common shares
    outstanding for each quarter and the sum of the quarters may not
    necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted earnings
    per common share amounts.

Our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in
    the summer months, primarily due to the traditional seasonal
    increase in the volume of construction and demolition waste. The
    volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions
    where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months.
    Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations
    typically reflect these seasonal trends, although we saw a
    significantly weaker seasonal volume increase during 2009 than
    we generally experience. Additionally, from time to time, our
    operating results are significantly affected by certain
    transactions or events that management believes are not
    indicative or representative of our results. The following
    significant items have affected the comparison of our operating
    results during the periods presented:

First
    Quarter 2010

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by the
    recognition of a $28 million charge to
    “Operating” expenses incurred by our Midwest Group as
    a result of bargaining unit employees in Michigan and Ohio
    agreeing to our proposal to withdraw them from an under-funded
    multiemployer pension plan. This charge reduced diluted earnings
    per share for the quarter by $0.04.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

The severe winter weather experienced in early 2010 reduced our
    revenues and increased our overtime and landfill operating
    costs, causing an estimated decrease in our diluted earnings per
    share of $0.02.

.

Second
    Quarter 2010

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a pre-tax cash benefit of $77 million due to
    the settlement of a lawsuit related to the abandonment of
    revenue management software, which had a favorable impact of
    $0.10 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by (i) the
    recognition of a pre-tax non-cash charge of $39 million
    related to increases in our environmental remediation reserves
    principally related to two closed landfill sites; and
    (ii) the recognition of an $8 million unfavorable
    adjustment to “Operating” expenses due to a decrease
    from 3.75% to 3.0% in the discount rate used to estimate the
    present value of our environmental remediation obligations and
    recovery assets. These items decreased the quarter’s
    “Net Income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share.

•

Our “Provision for income taxes” for the quarter was
    increased by the recognition of a tax charge of $37 million
    principally related to refinements in estimates of our deferred
    state income taxes, which had a negative impact of $0.08 on our
    diluted earnings per share.

Third
    Quarter 2010

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by (i) the
    recognition of pre-tax, non-cash charges aggregating
    $16 million related to remediation and closure costs at
    four closed sites; and (ii) the recognition of a
    $6 million unfavorable adjustment to “Operating”
    expenses due to a decrease from 3.0% to 2.5% in the discount
    rate used to estimate the present value of our environmental
    remediation obligations and recovery assets. These items
    decreased the quarter’s “Net Income attributable to
    Waste Management, Inc.” by $14 million, or $0.03 per
    diluted share.

•

Our “Provision for income taxes” for the quarter was
    increased by the recognition of net tax charges of
    $4 million due to adjustments relating to the finalization
    of our 2009 tax returns, partially offset by favorable tax audit
    settlements, which, combined, had a negative impact of $0.01 on
    our diluted earnings per share.

Fourth
    Quarter 2010

•

Income from operations was positively affected by (i) a
    $29 million decrease to “Depreciation and
    amortization” expense for adjustments associated with
    changes in our expectations for the timing and cost of future
    capping, closure and post-closure of fully utilized airspace;
    and (ii) the recognition of a $12 million favorable
    adjustment to “Operating” expenses due to an increase
    from 2.5% to 3.5% in the discount rate used to estimate the
    present value of our environmental remediation obligations and
    recovery assets. These items increased the quarter’s
    “Net Income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $25 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by the
    recognition of pre-tax litigation charges of $31 million,
    which had an unfavorable impact of $0.04 on our diluted earnings
    per share.

•

Our “Provision for income taxes” for the quarter was
    reduced by $9 million as a result of (i) the
    recognition of a benefit of $6 million due to tax audit
    settlements; and (ii) the realization of state net
    operating loss and credit carry-forwards of $3 million.
    This decrease in taxes positively affected the quarter’s
    diluted earnings per common share by $0.02.

First
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a $10 million favorable adjustment to
    “Operating” expenses due to an increase from 2.25% to
    2.75% in the discount rate used to estimate the



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

present value of our environmental remediation obligations. This
    reduction to “Operating” expenses resulted in a
    corresponding increase in “Net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests” of $2 million. The discount
    rate adjustment increased the quarter’s “Net income
    attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by $5 million,
    or $0.01 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by a non-cash
    charge of $49 million related to the abandonment of revenue
    management software, which reduced “Net income attributable
    to Waste Management, Inc.” by $30 million, or $0.06
    per diluted share. Additionally, we recognized $38 million
    of charges related to our January 2009 restructuring, which
    reduced “Net income attributable to Waste Management,
    Inc.” by $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

Second
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was positively affected by the
    recognition of a $22 million favorable adjustment to
    “Operating” expenses due to an increase from 2.75% to
    3.50% in the discount rate used to estimate the present value of
    our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets.
    This reduction to “Operating” expenses resulted in a
    corresponding increase in “Net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests” of $6 million. Additionally,
    our “Selling, general and administrative” expenses
    were reduced by $8 million as a result of the reversal of
    all compensation costs previously recognized for our 2008
    performance share units based on a determination that it is no
    longer probable that the targets established for that award will
    be met. These items increased the quarter’s “Net
    income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $15 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by (i) a
    $9 million charge to “Operating” expenses for a
    withdrawal of bargaining unit employees from an underfunded,
    multiemployer pension fund; (ii) $5 million of charges
    related to our January 2009 restructuring; and (iii) a
    $2 million impairment charge recognized by our Southern
    Group due to a change in expectations for the operating life of
    a landfill. These items decreased the quarter’s “Net
    income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $10 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Third
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by
    $3 million of charges related to our January 2009
    restructuring. This charge negatively affected “Net income
    attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” for the quarter by
    $2 million.

•

Our “Provision for income taxes” for the quarter was
    reduced by $19 million primarily as a result of the
    finalization of our 2008 tax returns and tax audit settlements,
    which positively affected “Diluted earnings per common
    share” by $0.04.

Fourth
    Quarter 2009

•

Income from operations was positively affected by (i) an
    $18 million increase in the revenues of our Eastern Group
    for payments received under an oil and gas lease at one of our
    landfills; and (ii) a $22 million decrease to
    “Depreciation and amortization” expense for
    adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the
    timing and cost of future capping, closure and post-closure of
    fully utilized airspace. These items increased the
    quarter’s “Net income attributable to Waste
    Management, Inc.” by $24 million, or $0.05 per diluted
    share.

•

Income from operations was negatively affected by (i) a
    $27 million impairment charge recognized by our Western
    Group as a result in a change in expectations for the future
    operations of an inactive landfill in California; (ii) a
    $12 million increase to “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses for several legal matters;
    (iii) a $4 million impairment charge required to
    write-down certain of our investments in portable self-storage
    operations to their fair value as a result of our acquisition of
    a controlling financial interest in those operations;
    (iv) $4 million of charges related to our January 2009
    restructuring; and (v) a $2 million

impairment charge related to the abandonment of revenue
    management software. These items decreased the quarter’s
    “Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” by
    $29 million, or $0.06 per diluted share.

•

Our “Provision for income taxes” for the quarter was
    reduced by $111 million as a result of (i) the
    liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, which generated a capital
    loss that could be utilized to offset capital gains generated in
    previous years; (ii) the realization of state net operating
    loss and credit carry-forwards; (iii) a reduction in
    provincial tax rates in Ontario, Canada, which resulted in the
    revaluation of related deferred tax balances; and (iv) tax audit
    settlements. This significant decrease in taxes resulted in an
    effective tax rate of 4.9% for the fourth quarter of 2009 and
    positively affected the quarter’s “Diluted earnings
    per common share” by $0.23.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements (Unaudited)

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

— In
    October 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated
    with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This amended
    guidance addresses the determination of when individual
    deliverables within an arrangement may be treated as separate
    units of accounting and modifies the manner in which
    consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable
    deliverables. The amendments to authoritative guidance
    associated with multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements became
    effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The new
    accounting standard may be applied either retrospectively for
    all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered
    into or materially modified after the date of adoption. We do
    not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
    However, our adoption of this guidance may significantly impact
    our accounting and reporting for future revenue arrangements to
    the extent they are material.



Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Effectiveness
    of Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our principal
    executive and financial officers, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in
    ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in
    reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to management (including the
    principal executive and financial officers) as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on
    such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers
    have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of December 31, 2010 (the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K).

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s report on our internal control over financial
    reporting can be found in Item 8,

Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data,

of this report. Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010 as stated in their
    report, which appears in Item 8 of this report.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes
    in our internal control over financial reporting during the
    quarter ended December 31, 2010. We determined that there
    were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
