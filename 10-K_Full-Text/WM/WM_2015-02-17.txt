Business.

General

The financial statements
presented in this report represent the consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation; Waste Management’s wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which Waste Management or its
subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries as described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Waste Management is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. When the terms “the Company,”
“we,” “us” or “our” are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When we use the term “WM,” we are
referring only to Waste Management, Inc., the parent holding company.

WM was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name “USA
Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a Delaware company in 1995. In a 1998 merger, the Illinois-based waste services company formerly known as Waste Management, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WM and changed its name to
Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”). At the same time, our parent holding company changed its name from USA Waste Services to Waste Management, Inc. Like WM, WM Holdings is a holding company and all operations are conducted by
subsidiaries. For detail on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of WM, WM Holdings and their subsidiaries, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone number at that address is
(713) 512-6200. Our website address is www.wm.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as practicable after we file the
reports with the SEC. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WM.”

We are North America’s
leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services. We partner with our residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to
disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. Our “Solid Waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection, transfer,
recycling and resource recovery, and disposal services. Through our subsidiaries, we are also a leading developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the United States. In December 2014, we completed the sale of our
subsidiary, Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. Our Wheelabrator business provided waste-to-energy services and managed waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. During 2014, our largest customer represented less than 1% of
annual revenues. We employed approximately 39,800 people as of December 31, 2014.

We own or operate 252 landfill sites, which is the
largest network of landfills in our industry. In order to make disposal more practical for larger urban markets, where the distance to landfills is typically farther, we manage 298 transfer stations that consolidate, compact and transport waste
efficiently and economically. We also use waste to create energy, recovering the gas produced naturally as waste decomposes in landfills and using the gas in generators to make electricity. We are a leading recycler in North America, handling
materials that include paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, metal and electronics. We provide cost-efficient, environmentally sound recycling programs for municipalities, businesses and households across the U.S. and Canada as well as other services
that supplement our traditional Solid Waste business.

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the
environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders, and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry. Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential
resource. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are



becoming more complex, and our aim is to address, and anticipate, the current, expanding and evolving needs of our customers. Accomplishment of our goals will grow our Company and allow us to
meet the needs of our customers and communities as they, too, Think Green

®

.

We
believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader,
we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our
economy and our environment can thrive. Drawing on our resources and experience, we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry, the customers and communities we serve and the environment.

We remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy: to know and service our customers
better than anyone in our industry, to extract more value from the materials we manage, and to innovate and optimize our business. We plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from a “best cost”
structure achieved through operational improvements and differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate
additional value, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as recycling operations.

In pursuit of
these long-term goals, we recognize that we must grow the business, and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Accordingly, we are focusing on the following five key company priorities:

•

Customers: provide the best possible service to our customers;

•

Traditional Waste Business: continuously improve our operational performance;

•

Growth: take advantage of opportunities in our current business, as well as considering attractive acquisition opportunities;

•

Yield Management: remain focused on price leadership while considering competitive dynamics; and

•

Costs: minimize both operating costs and selling, general & administrative expenses.

We believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic
industry. In addition, we intend to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividend payments and common stock repurchases. In February 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from
$0.375 to $0.385 per share for dividends declared in 2015, which is a 2.7% increase from the quarterly dividends we declared in 2014. This will result in an increase in the amount of free cash flow that we expect to pay out as dividends for the 12

th

consecutive year and is an indication of our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows. All quarterly dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

Operations

General

We evaluate, oversee and manage the financial performance of our local Solid Waste business subsidiaries through our 17 Areas. See Note 21 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments. In December 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business, which provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power
production plants. We intend to re-invest the proceeds from the sale of our Wheelabrator business to create long-term stockholder value. Our priority is to pursue acquisitions in our Solid Waste business, and we will also evaluate repurchasing our
common stock and making other investments in support of our strategic growth plans, while continuing our focus on a strong balance sheet. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our



divestiture. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business as described below. These operations are presented in this report as “Other.”

We have expanded certain of our operations through acquisitions, which are discussed further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In January 2013, we acquired Greenstar, LLC, (“Greenstar”), an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. This acquisition provides the Company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions, having
supplemented the Company’s extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers. In July 2013, we acquired substantially all of the assets of RCI Environnement, Inc.
(“RCI”), the largest waste management company in Quebec, and certain related entities. RCI provides collection, transfer, recycling and disposal operations throughout the Greater Montreal area. The acquired RCI operations complement and
expand the Company’s existing assets and operations in Quebec.

The table below shows the total revenues (in millions) contributed
annually by our Solid Waste and Wheelabrator businesses, in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014. More information about our results of operations is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 7.

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins with a vast waste collection network. Collection
involves picking up and transporting waste and recyclable materials from where it was generated to a transfer station, material recovery facility (“MRF”) or disposal site. We generally provide collection services under one of two types of
arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the agreements are
influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection



equipment we furnish, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general market factors. As part of the service, we
provide steel containers to most customers to store their solid waste between pick-up dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many are designed to be lifted
mechanically and either emptied into a truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site. By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality, homeowners’ association or some other regional authority that gives us the exclusive right to
service all or a portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are typically for periods of three to six years. We also provide services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to households. The fees for residential
collection are either paid by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service.

Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories for solid waste in North America. At December 31, 2014, we owned or operated 247
solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills, which represents the largest network of landfills in North America. Solid waste landfills are constructed and operated on land with engineering safeguards that limit the possibility of
water and air pollution, and are operated under procedures prescribed by regulation. A landfill must meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations during its design, construction, operation and closure. The operation and closure
activities of a solid waste landfill include excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other acceptable material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These operations
are carefully planned to maintain environmentally safe conditions and to maximize the use of the airspace.

All solid waste management
companies must have access to a disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. The significant capital requirements of developing and operating a landfill serve as a barrier to landfill ownership and, as a result, third-party haulers often
dispose of waste at our landfills. It is usually preferable for our collection operations to use disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer to as internalization, rather than using third-party disposal facilities.
Internalization generally allows us to realize higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows. The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including competition and the
type and weight or volume of solid waste deposited.

Under environmental laws, the federal government (or states with delegated authority)
must issue permits for all hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills have obtained the required permits, although some can accept only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also comply with specialized
operating standards. Only hazardous waste in a stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these treatments involve
the separation or removal of solid materials from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner designed to
provide long-term containment of waste. We also operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the
base of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers.

Transfer.

At
December 31, 2014, we owned or operated 298 transfer stations in North America. We deposit waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of
the waste and transported by transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect
waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities. Fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of



the waste deposited at the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors.

The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees that we would
otherwise pay to third parties for the disposal of the waste we collect. It enables us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks, railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than collection trucks,
allowing us to deliver more waste to the disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically located to increase the efficiency of our network of operations and (iii) we can
retain the volume by managing the transfer of the waste to one of our own disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do
not own generally are operated through lease agreements under which we lease property from third parties. There are some instances where transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for municipalities. In most cases we own the permits
and will be responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station.

Wheelabrator.

On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of
$519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In conjunction with the sale, the Company
entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments, with certain market price resets, for up to seven years.

Wheelabrator provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production
plants. Wheelabrator owns or operates 16 waste-to-energy facilities and four independent power production plants. Prior to the sale, our Wheelabrator business constituted a reportable segment, as discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. We concluded that the sale of our Wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under current authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the long-term waste
supply agreements referred to above and in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recycling.

Our recycling operations
provide communities and businesses with an alternative to traditional landfill disposal and support our strategic goals to extract more value from the materials we manage. In 2001, we became the first major solid waste company to focus on
residential single-stream recycling, which allows customers to mix recyclable paper, plastic and glass in one bin. Residential single-stream programs have greatly increased the recycling rates. Single-stream recycling is possible through the use of
various mechanized screens and optical sorting technologies. We have also been advancing the single-stream recycling programs for commercial applications. Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the waste stream for processing
and resale or other disposition. Our recycling operations include the following:

Materials processing

—
Through our collection operations, we collect recyclable materials from residential, commercial and industrial customers and direct these materials to one of our MRFs for processing. We operate 126 MRFs where paper, cardboard, metals, plastics,
glass, construction and demolition materials and other recyclable commodities are recovered for resale.

Plastics
materials recycling

— Using state-of-the-art sorting and processing technology, we process, inventory and sell plastic commodities making the recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient.

Commodities recycling

— We market and resell recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the
marketing of recyclable commodities that are processed in our facilities by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market demands and product quality.



Recycling brokerage services

— We also provide recycling brokerage
services, which involve managing the marketing of recyclable materials for third parties. The experience of our recycling operations in managing recyclable commodities for our own operations gives us the expertise needed to effectively manage
volumes for third parties. Utilizing the resources and knowledge of our recycling operations’ service centers, we can assist customers in marketing and selling their recyclable commodities with minimal capital requirements. We also provide
electronics recycling. We recycle discarded computers, communications equipment, and other electronic equipment. Services include the collection, sorting and disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle all collected materials. In
recent years, we have teamed with major electronics manufacturers to offer comprehensive “take-back” programs of their products to assist the general public in disposing of their old electronics in a convenient and environmentally safe
manner.

Some of the recyclable materials processed in our MRFs are purchased from various sources, including third parties and our own
operations. The price we pay for recyclable materials is often referred to as a “rebate.” Rebates generally are based upon the price we receive for sales of processed goods, market conditions and transportation costs, but in some cases are
based on fixed contractual rates or on defined minimum per-ton rates. As a result, changes in commodity prices for recycled materials also significantly affect the rebates we pay to our suppliers, which are recorded as “Operating expenses”
within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In recent years, we have been focused on revising our rebate structures to ensure that we cover our cost of handling and processing the materials and generate an acceptable margin on the materials we
process and sell.

Other.

Other services we provide include the following:

Although many waste management services such as collection and disposal are local services, our strategic accounts program, which is managed
by our Strategic Business Solutions organization, works with customers whose locations span the United States. Our strategic accounts program provides centralized customer service, billing and management of accounts to streamline the administration
of customers’ multiple and nationwide locations’ waste management needs.

Our Energy and Environmental Services organization
offers our customers in all Areas a variety of services in collaboration with our Area and strategic accounts programs, including (i) construction and remediation services; (ii) services associated with the disposal of fly ash, residue
generated from the combustion of coal and other fuel stocks; (iii) in-plant services, where our employees work full-time inside our customers’ facilities to provide full-service waste management solutions and consulting services; this
service is managed through our Energy and Environmental Services organization but reflected principally in our collection business and (iv) specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations; revenues
for this service are also reflected principally in our collection business. Our vertically integrated waste management operations enable us to provide customers with full management of their waste. The breadth of our service offerings and the
familiarity we have with waste management practices gives us the unique ability to assist customers in minimizing the amount of waste they generate, identifying recycling opportunities, determining the most efficient means available for waste
collection and disposal and ensuring that disposal is achieved in a manner that is both reflective of the current regulatory environment and environmentally friendly.

We develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas through our WM Renewable Energy Program. Landfill gas is
produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel. The EPA endorses landfill
gas as a renewable energy resource, in the same category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At December 31, 2014, we had 134 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 123 of our solid waste
landfills and four third-party landfills. At 107 of these landfills, the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators. The electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal utilities or power cooperatives. At 16 landfills, the gas is
used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. At



10 landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers. At one landfill, the gas is processed into liquefied natural gas and used
as vehicle fuel.

We continue to invest in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or
supplementary to our current operations. These investments include joint ventures, acquisitions and partial ownership interests. The solutions and services include the collection of project waste, including construction debris and household or yard
waste, through our Bagster

®

program; the development, operation and marketing of plasma gasification facilities; operation of a landfill gas-to-liquid natural gas plant; solar powered trash
compactors; and organic waste-to-fuel conversion technology. We also offer portable self-storage services through a joint venture; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our
LampTracker

®

program; portable restroom servicing under the name Port-o-Let

®

; and street and parking lot sweeping services. In
addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties.

Competition

We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In North America,
the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of
alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. Some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing
aggressive regional growth strategies. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations.

Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge are
determined locally, and typically vary by volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the
geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense competition in our Solid Waste business based on pricing and quality of service. We have also begun competing for business based on breadth of
service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we are investing in greener technologies and promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of
waste.

Seasonal Trends

Our
operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during
the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Through 2014, the operating results of our first quarter also often reflected higher repair and maintenance expenses because,
prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business, we relied on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities.

Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes can significantly affect the operating
results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can
actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time span, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors,
such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins.



Employees

At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 39,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,000 were employed in administrative and
sales positions and the balance in operations. Approximately 8,500 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial
Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their
obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits; (ii) supporting variable-rate tax-exempt debt and (iii) estimated final
capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills. We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees. The
type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity.

Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party surety and insurance companies; (ii) an
entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, National Guaranty Insurance Company of Vermont, the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds and/or insurance policies on our
behalf. Letters of credit generally are supported by our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and other credit facilities established for that purpose.

Insurance

We
carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability, business interruption and
other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under the related insurance policy. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial General
Liability Insurance Policy carried self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31, 2014,
our auto liability insurance program included a per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to additional deductibles of $4.8 million in the $5 million to $10 million layer. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property,
environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our estimated insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2014 are summarized in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive
liability, often referred to as “Broad Form Side A,” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage, often referred to as “Side B.” The Side A policy covers directors and officers directly for loss, including defense
costs, when corporate indemnification is unavailable. Side A-only coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the Company, as the Company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and
officers.

Regulation

Our business
is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”), Environment Canada, and various other federal, state, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in the United States and Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our
operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of



violations. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against
operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue.

Because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner, a significant amount of
our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting,
operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition, development or expansion of a management or disposal facility or transfer
station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating
permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these
expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.

The primary United States
federal statutes affecting our business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), as amended, regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop
programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991, the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA, which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically
implemented by the states, although states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D standards. We incur costs in complying with these standards in the ordinary course of our operations.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (“CERCLA”) which is also known as Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to releases or
threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have created actual or potential environmental hazards. CERCLA’s primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of disposal sites upon
current and former site owners and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the site and transporters who selected the disposal site and transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional release
of hazardous substances; it can be based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of hazardous substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable statutes and
regulations. The EPA may issue orders requiring responsible parties to perform response actions at sites, or the EPA may seek recovery of funds expended or to be expended in the future at sites. Liability may include contribution for cleanup costs
incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators in an administrative or judicially-approved settlement. Liability under CERCLA could also include obligations
to a potentially responsible party, or PRP, that voluntarily expends site clean-up costs. Further, liability for damage to publicly-owned natural resources may also be imposed. We are subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or
operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed and as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, known as the Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers,
groundwater, or other surface waters from a variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal sites. If run-off from our operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain
discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards for management of storm water runoff that require landfills and
other waste-handling facilities to obtain



storm water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with
discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act
provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act,
including large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and emission guidelines (“EG”) controlling landfill gases from new and
existing large landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for municipal solid waste landfills subject to the NSPS. These regulations impose limits on air emissions from large
municipal solid waste landfills, subject most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act and, in many instances, require installation of landfill gas collection and
control systems to control emissions or to treat and utilize landfill gas on- or off-site. The EPA entered into a settlement agreement with the Environmental Defense Fund to evaluate the 1996 NSPS for new landfills as required by the Clean Air Act
every eight years and revise them if deemed necessary. The EPA published a proposed NSPS rule July 17, 2014 and plans to finalize this rule by March 31, 2015. Where we identified potential for increased capital and operating expenses, we
provided formal comment and technical support to the EPA to minimize the impact to our operations. We expect the EPA will address our comments in the final rule. Where the EPA does not address our comments in the final rule, we will re-assess the
capital and operating cost impact to our operations. The EPA also plans to propose an EG rule for existing landfills by March 31, 2015 and finalize this rule by March 2016. Should the EPA adopt more stringent requirements, capital expenditures
and operating costs may increase. However, we do not believe that the regulatory changes would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.

Additionally, emission and fuel economy standards have been imposed on manufacturers of transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles). The EPA continues to evaluate and develop regulations to increase
fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions; such regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet, but we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, (“OSHA”) establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or
serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and various reporting and record keeping obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of
hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of hazardous materials
and hazardous waste, including safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

We are also actively monitoring the following recent developments in United States federal regulations affecting our
business:

•

In 2010, the EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to
include the six GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash
flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation.



In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that significantly limited the applicability and scope of EPA permitting requirements for GHGs from stationary sources, concluding that: the EPA may not treat GHGs
as an air pollutant for purposes of determining whether a source is required to obtain a PSD or Title V permit; and the EPA can continue to require that PSD permits otherwise required based on emissions of conventional pollutants contain limitations
on GHG emissions based on Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”). Following this ruling, the EPA issued a policy memorandum advising that it intends to propose exempting biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from waste-derived feedstocks
(municipal solid waste and landfill gas) from PSD and Title V air permitting. The EPA anticipates basing this proposal on the rationale that those emissions are likely to have minimal or no net atmospheric contributions, or even reduce such impacts,
when compared to an alternate method of disposal. As a result of this U.S. Supreme Court ruling and EPA policy action, the potential impact of the PSD and Title V GHG Tailoring Rule on our air permits, compliance and results of operations is
significantly reduced.

Other recent final and proposed rules to increase the stringency of certain National Ambient Air Quality Standards, such as the Ozone rule proposed in December 2014, and related PSD increment/significance thresholds
could affect the cost, timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large municipal solid waste landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In general, controlling emissions involves installing collection wells in a landfill
and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery system or combustion device. At December 31, 2014, we had 134 projects at solid waste landfills where landfill gas was captured and utilized for its renewable energy value rather than flared.
Efforts to curtail the emission of GHGs and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls, with associated capital or operating costs; however, we do not believe that such regulations
will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — “The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to
operate.”

The EPA recently clarified in its November 2014 policy memorandum that states may rely on waste-derived biogenic feedstocks in their future proposed compliance plans required by the proposed Clean Power Plan rules. This
recognition by the EPA may create new or expanded opportunities for renewable energy projects.

We are taking steps to anticipate the future needs of our customers which include investing in and developing ever-more-advanced recycling and reuse technologies. Potential climate change and GHG regulatory initiatives
have influenced our business strategy to provide low-carbon services to our customers, and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth. If the U.S. were to impose a carbon tax or other
form of GHG regulation increasing demand for low-carbon service offerings in the future, the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable.

•

In 2011, the EPA published the Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials (“NHSM”) Rule, which provides the standards and procedures for identifying whether NHSM are solid waste under RCRA when used as fuels or
ingredients in combustion units. The EPA also published new source performance standards and emission guidelines for commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units, and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards for commercial and
industrial boilers. The EPA published clarifications and amendments to these rules in 2013, and there is litigation surrounding the rules. Although the recently published amendments are generally favorable to our industry, some of the potential
regulatory interpretations are undergoing review and other regulatory outcomes may be dependent on case-by-case administrative determinations. These could have a significant impact on some of our projects in which we are seeking to convert biomass
or other secondary materials into products, fuels or energy. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the financial impact of these rulemakings or pending administrative determinations at the present time. However, we believe the rules and
administrative determinations will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole and are more likely to facilitate our efforts to reuse or recover energy value from secondary material streams.



•

In December 2014, the EPA issued a final rule regulating the disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion residuals (“CCR”). The regulations encourage beneficial use of CCR in encapsulated uses (e.g., used
in cement or wallboard), and use according to established industry standards (e.g., application of sludge for agricultural enrichment). The EPA also deemed disposal and beneficial use of CCR at permitted municipal solid waste landfills exempt from
the new regulations because the RCRA Subtitle D standards applicable at municipal solid waste landfills provide at least equivalent protection. The new standards are consistent with our approach to handling CCR at our sites currently, and we believe
the new standards will provide a potential growth opportunity for the Company. States may impose standards more stringent than the federal program, and we will be monitoring state implementation to determine impact.

State, Provincial and Local Regulations

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations. Each state and province in which we operate has
its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States and provinces have also adopted regulations governing the
design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types
of requirements.

Our landfill operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal. Several state
and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard and food waste, at landfills. The number of cities with food waste recycling requirements and disposal bans
continues to grow, while the logistics and economics of food waste recycling remain challenging.

Various states have enacted, or are
considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. While laws that overtly discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less
overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction
waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the United
States Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local
government was constitutional. The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations
of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.

Additionally,
regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in Canada and the U.S. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total
responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end
users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to
implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste, recycling and other streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste
services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the



applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent, subsidiaries or
affiliated companies, in addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and to deny or revoke a
contract or permit because of unfitness, unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable
laws and regulations.

Foreign Import Regulation

Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. In 2013, the Chinese government began to
strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables. The higher quality
expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend
to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. Despite these increased costs, we believe we are well positioned among our potential competitors to respond to and comply with such
regulations. We are revising our service agreements to address these increased costs and are working with stakeholders to educate the general public on the need to recycle properly.

Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation

Our Energy Services line of business provides specialized environmental management and disposal services for oil and gas exploration and
production operations. Recently, there has been increased attention from the public, some states and the EPA on the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened regulatory focus on emissions
of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas, as well as protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with
exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services. On the other hand, we believe the size, capital structure, regulatory sophistication and established
reliability of our Company provide us with an advantage in providing services that must comply with any complex regulatory regime that may govern providing oilfield waste services.

Emissions from Natural Gas Fueling and Infrastructure

We currently operate the largest compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fleet in the waste industry, and we plan to continue to transition a
significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to CNG. We have constructed and operate 72 natural gas fueling stations, 25 of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties, in 28 states and three Canadian provinces.
Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. We have partnered with the environmental organization Environmental Defense Fund, as well as other
heavy-duty equipment users and experts, on an emissions study to be made available to policy makers. We anticipate that this comprehensive study of emissions from our heavy-duty fleet may ultimately result in regulations that will affect equipment
manufacturers and will define operating procedures across the industry. Additional regulation of, or restrictions on, CNG fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. We are not yet able to
evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations, but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business or our current plan to continue transitioning to CNG vehicles.



Federal, State and Local Climate Change Initiatives

In light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change, we have identified a strategic business opportunity
to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions. As part of our on-going marketing evaluations, we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable
carbon reductions, such as waste reduction, increased recycling, and conversion of landfill gas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel. We use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value
proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider. We are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users’ carbon footprints. We
understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we work with stakeholders at the federal and
state level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity.

We continue to
assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events. We are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm
events, which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business, we may make “forward-looking statements.”
Forward-looking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the words, “will,”
“may,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “forecast,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend” and words of a similar
nature and generally include statements containing:

•

projections about accounting and finances;

•

plans and objectives for the future;

•

projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our performance; or

•

our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or future events, circumstances or performance.

You should view these statements with caution. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. They are
based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. All aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone or taken
together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events,
circumstances or developments. The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements
for 2015 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forward-looking statements made by the Company.

The waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition
and operating results may be materially adversely affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental
and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In North America, the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that



specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy
and other by-products. Some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain
their own waste collection and disposal operations. These counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them. Also, such
governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage. In addition, some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations, allowing them to reduce their prices to expand
sales volume or to win competitively-bid contracts, including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities. When this happens, we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy, resulting in a
negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business.

If we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial
performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.

Our future financial performance and success are dependent
in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources.
See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Overview

for more information on our business strategy.

There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following:

•

Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy.

•

We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.

•

In efforts to enhance our revenues, we have implemented price increases and environmental fees, and we have continued our fuel surcharge program to offset fuel costs. The loss of volumes as a result of price increases
may negatively affect our cash flows or results of operations.

•

We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result.

•

Our restructuring may not achieve and/or maintain the goals and cost savings intended.

•

Strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may record material charges against earnings due to any number of events that
could cause impairments to our assets.

•

Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on
favorable terms, and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions.

•

Acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of
emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others.

•

Integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.

•

Execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial
plans.



•

We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic
operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses.

In addition to the
risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased
operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and
profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.

Compliance with existing or future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase
our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection,
health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against
operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

•

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities;

•

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes;

•

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste;

•

mandates regarding the management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or

•

limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams.

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail
operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other
governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

We also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing
landfills. We establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals. Environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to
materially exceed our current accruals.



Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within
the state of solid waste generated outside the state. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction
waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted “flow control” regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. The United States
Congress’ adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts’ interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation,
could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.

Additionally, regulations establishing extended producer
responsibility, or EPR, are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in Canada and the U.S. EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle
of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling
processing infrastructure. There is no federal law establishing EPR in the U.S. or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were
adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. A significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can
affect our ability to export products. In 2013, the Chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics. The higher
quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as “Operation Green Fence” can drive up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream MRFs. Single stream MRFs process a wide range of commingled materials
and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. If Operation Green Fence or other similar initiatives or new regulations increase our operating costs in the future, and
we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which are subject to
significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities,
particularly demand from Chinese paper mills, can affect our operating income and cash flows negatively, such as we experienced in 2014, 2013 and 2012. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to
commodity price fluctuations. The decline in market prices in 2014, 2013 and 2012 for commodities resulted in year-over-year decreases in revenue of $53 million, $79 million and $428 million, respectively. Additionally, our recycling operations
offer rebates to suppliers. Therefore, even if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. In other circumstances, the rebates may be subject to a floor, such that as market
prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated.

Fluctuation in energy
prices also affects our business. Significant variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to
our revenue from yield from such operations. Additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our Energy Services business. Demand for these services may decrease if drilling
activity slows due to changes in oil and gas prices, such as the pronounced recent price decreases. Any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future.



Changes in regulations applicable to oil and gas drilling and production could adversely
affect our Energy Services business.

Energy Services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due
to industry conditions beyond our control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. Changes in laws or government regulations regarding GHG emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers’
costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers. Recently, there has been increased attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water
supplies. There is also heightened regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas, as well as protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and
production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services.

Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and
operating results to decline.

Our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as
recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. In addition, several state and local governments mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such
as yard and food waste, at landfills or waste-to-energy facilities. Where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill or waste-to-energy facility, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their
organic waste from landfills. Zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of North America’s largest companies. Although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the
volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Our landfills currently provide and, together with our divested waste-to-energy facilities, have historically provided our highest income
from operations margins. If we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then
our revenues and operating results may decline. Additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to
disposal alternatives.

Developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste
streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and waste-to-energy facilities and our profitability.

Our Company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Research and development activities
are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. We and many other companies are investing in these technologies. It is possible
that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. As a result, our revenues and margins could be
adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives.

If we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect
intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer.

Our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect, new technologies.
Research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. We may experience difficulties or delays in
the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may



negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. Further, protecting our
intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. Our
Company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. If a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a “breakthrough
technology” that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer.

Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand.

We believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our
brand symbolizes these attributes. The Waste Management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or
not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. This reduction in
demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our
reputation and restore the value of our brand.

Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations,
as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities.

There is risk of incurring significant
environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the
property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations
involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the
counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental
contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, we are currently, and we
may in the future, become involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to land use and environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit
we need; and

•

local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are
subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or
other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well
as material charges for asset impairments.



Further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet
certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. Costs to remediate
or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant.

General economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our
revenues and our income from operations margins.

Our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic
factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our
revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows.
In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by
customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase
in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index.

Some of our customers, including governmental entities, have
suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results.

We provide
service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. Some of these entities could be unable
to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates.

Many non-governmental customers have also suffered
serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. Purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. The inability of our customers to pay us in
a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results.

In
addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors’ demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, we had $501 million of variable-rate
tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and $638 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next twelve months. If the
weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.

We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease
our revenue and increase our costs.

Our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to
obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. Permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain.
Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other
political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or
regulations to which we are subject,



or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and
expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills
could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Significant
shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses.

The price and supply of
diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other
oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Average diesel fuel prices decreased in both 2014 and 2013 but increased in 2012. We need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection
and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise
their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’
contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. Additionally, we recently settled litigation that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices, and we may face similar claims in the future. See Note 11 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins.

We are expanding our compressed natural gas (“CNG”) truck fleet, which makes us increasingly dependent on the availability of
CNG and CNG fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to CNG prices.

We currently operate the largest CNG fleet in the waste industry,
and we plan to continue to transition a significant portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to CNG. However, CNG is not yet broadly available in North America; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some
of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. Until the public and third parties in North America broadly adopt CNG, which may not be on the timetable we anticipate, it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in CNG fueling
infrastructure in order to power our CNG fleet. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. New regulation of, or restrictions on, CNG fueling infrastructure or
reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the price and supply of CNG could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between CNG
and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in CNG vehicles. Further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for CNG may not effectively be recovered
by this program.

We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails, our business could be
adversely affected.

We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology
systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and
delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations.



A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with
customers.

We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking
and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the
storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about
the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new
initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess
and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our
preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information
technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.

Our operating expenses could increase as a result of labor unions organizing or changes in regulations related to labor unions.

Labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain groups
of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, the negotiation of
collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase
significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. Any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans.

We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by
collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to
employees or former employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and
(iii) if we choose to stop participating in any of our multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.

In connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or
partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. Further, business events, such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations,
which result in the decline of Company contributions to a multiemployer pension plan, could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal. In the event of a withdrawal, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at
the time of the withdrawal. Various factors affect our liabilities for a plan’s underfunded status, including the numbers of retirees and active workers in the plan, the ongoing solvency of participating employers, the investment returns
obtained on plan assets, and the ratio of our historical participation in such plan to all employers’ historical participation; depending on such factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of



operations for a particular reporting period. We reflect any withdrawal liability as an operating expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet.

We have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans, and we recognized related
expenses of $4 million in 2014, $5 million in 2013 and $10 million in 2012. We are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for certain withdrawals, which could be higher than the charges we have recognized.

Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others.

Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as
truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, mass instability or waste slides, severe weather and natural disasters, which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials and odors, injury or death of employees and
others, or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken. Additionally, we have built and are operating CNG fueling stations to serve our growing fleet of CNG trucks, some of which also serve the
public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. All of these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental
damages, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, and property damage or destruction.

While we seek to minimize our exposure
to such risks through comprehensive training and compliance programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand.

We have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities.

The
amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are
generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. We face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of other
insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. The inability of our insurers to meet their commitments
in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. To the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we
estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations
with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and
escrow accounts or rely upon WM financial guarantees. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. Our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and
general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. Additionally, in the event
we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial
assurance. It is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. Other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to



obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become
due.

We may record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets.

In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we capitalize certain expenditures and
advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. Events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a
facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. Additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset
impairments. If we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we
estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain
triggering events. We may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

Our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and
development plans, or fail to maintain our desired credit profile.

If economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a
significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. We may choose to incur
indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. We also may need to incur indebtedness to
refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. Further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to
incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our
control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third party rating agencies. If we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on
favorable terms could be adversely affected.

Additionally, we have $1.4 billion of debt as of December 31, 2014 that is exposed to
changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our Canadian term loan. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering
our net income and decreasing our cash flow.

We may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our C$150 million Canadian
revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in July 2018 and November 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings and $785 million of letters of credit issued and
supported by the $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,465 million, and we had no borrowings under the Canadian revolving credit facility. In the event of a default under our credit
facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally, any such default could cause a default
under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.



The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of
“greenhouse gases” could increase our costs to operate.

Our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a GHG. There
are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of GHGs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. Should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it
could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. In 2010, the EPA published a Prevention of Significant Deterioration
and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The current
requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. However, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as
lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs.

The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events and “one-time” special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and
prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer
months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter
revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. The operating results of our first quarter often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months, when waste flows are generally
lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities.

Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods
of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the
year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues
through additional work for a limited time span, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins.

For these and other reasons, operating results in any interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year,
and operating results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period. Our stock price may be negatively impacted by interim variations in our results.

We could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third
parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with United States or foreign laws or regulations.

Some of our
projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and with applicable local
laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners’ compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local
partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.



Currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material
adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.

We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of our
business and from time-to-time are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to
these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.

We may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and
interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 380,000 square
feet under leases expiring through 2020. We also have administrative offices in Arizona, Illinois, Texas, Connecticut and India. We own or lease real property in most locations where we have operations or administrative functions. We have operations
in all 50 states. We also have operations in the District of Columbia and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment
consists of land (primarily landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and equipment. We believe that our vehicles, equipment, and operating properties are adequately
maintained and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to continue to make investments in additional equipment and property for expansion, for replacement of assets, and in connection with our strategic growth plans. For more
information, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included within this report.

Our quarterly dividends have been declared and approved by our Board of Directors and paid in accordance with
our financial plans. Cash dividends declared and paid were $693 million in 2014, or $1.50 per common share, $683 million in 2013, or $1.46 per common share and $658 million in 2012, or $1.42 per common share.

In February 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.375 to $0.385 per share for
dividends declared in 2015. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other
factors the Board may deem relevant.

Our share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of
Directors. In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized up to $600 million in future share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with two financial
institutions to repurchase an aggregate of $600 million of our common stock. At the beginning of the ASR repurchase periods, we delivered the $600 million in cash and received 9.6 million shares, which represented 70% of the shares expected to
be repurchased based on then-current market prices. These agreements were completed in February 2015 and we received approximately 2.8 million additional shares. The final weighted average per share purchase price for the completed ASR
agreements was $48.58.

We announced in February 2015 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1 billion in future share
repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board in making dividend declarations.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2014. This discussion may contain
forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in Item 1A,

Risk Factors

. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Overview

Our
Company’s goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders, and achievement of our goals is intended to meet the needs of a changing industry. Our Company and
others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. Increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming more complex, and our aim is to address, and anticipate,
the current, expanding and evolving needs of our customers. Accomplishment of our goals will grow our Company and allow us to meet the needs of our customers and communities as they, too, Think
Green

®

.

We believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the
changing waste industry and our customers’ waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. As the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our
customers’ waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance — maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact — so that both our economy and our environment can thrive. Drawing on our
resources and experience, we also pursue projects and initiatives that benefit the waste industry, the customers and communities we serve and the environment.

We remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our strategy: to know and service our customers
better than anyone in our industry, to extract more value from the materials we manage, and to innovate and optimize our business. We plan to accomplish our strategic goals through competitive advantages derived from a “best cost”
structure achieved through operational improvements and differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets. While we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate
additional value, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as recycling operations.

In pursuit of
these long-term goals, we recognize that we must grow the business, and do so as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Accordingly, we are focusing on the following five key company priorities:

•

Customers: provide the best possible service to our customers;

•

Traditional Waste Business: continuously improve our operational performance;

•

Growth: take advantage of opportunities in our current business, as well as considering attractive acquisition opportunities;

•

Yield Management: remain focused on price leadership while considering competitive dynamics; and

•

Costs: minimize both operating costs and selling, general & administrative expenses.

We believe that execution of our strategy through these key priorities will drive continued financial performance and leadership in a dynamic
industry.

Notable items of our 2014 financial results include:

•

Revenues of $13,996 million in 2014 compared with $13,983 million in 2013, an increase of $13 million. This increase in revenues is primarily
attributable to (i) positive revenue growth from



yield on our collection and disposal operations of $262 million, or 2.3%, and (ii) revenue from acquired operations, particularly the RCI operations acquired in July 2013, which increased
revenues by $77 million. Substantially offsetting these increases were (i) lower volumes which decreased our revenues by $188 million; (ii) divestitures of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill
assets as well as the December 2014 sale of our Wheelabrator business, which decreased our revenues by $90 million and (iii) foreign currency translation of $61 million related to our Canadian operations;

•

Operating expenses of $9,002 million in 2014, or 64.3% of revenues, compared with $9,112 million, or 65.2% of revenues, in 2013. This decrease of $110 million is largely driven by our decline in collection volumes
and divestitures, both of which affect several of our operating expense categories, particularly labor costs, transfer and disposal costs, and fuel costs;

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,481 million in 2014, or 10.6% of revenues, compared with $1,468 million, or 10.5% of revenues, in 2013. This increase of $13 million is driven mainly by higher
litigation settlements;

•

Restructuring costs of $82 million in 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013. The 2014 restructuring charges relate to the consolidation and realignment of several Corporate functions. We anticipate saving in
excess of $100 million annually from these actions when fully implemented in 2015;

•

Income from operations of $2,299 million, or 16.4% of revenues, in 2014 compared with $1,079 million, or 7.7% of revenues, in 2013, the increase of which is primarily attributable to the $519 million gain on
the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014 and impairment charges of $355 million recognized in 2014 compared to impairment charges of $981 million recognized in 2013 discussed below;

•

Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. of $1,298 million, or $2.79 per diluted share for 2014, as compared with $98 million, or $0.21 per diluted share for 2013, the increase of which is primarily
attributable to the increase in income from operations discussed above; and

•

In 2014, we returned $1,293 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared with $922 million in 2013.

The following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2014 results with 2013 has been provided to support
investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2014 results were affected by the following:

•

The recognition of net pre-tax gains of $515 million, which includes the $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business. These items had a positive impact of $1.10 on our diluted earnings per share;

•

Net income was negatively impacted by the recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $420 million primarily related to (i) $272 million of charges to impair our oil and gas producing properties; (ii) $69
million of charges to impair investments related to waste diversion technology companies; (iii) $31 million of litigation settlements; (iv) $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations; and
(v) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values related to certain of our operations. These items had a negative impact of $0.68 on our diluted earnings per share; and

•

The recognition of pre-tax restructuring charges of $82 million, which had a negative impact of $0.11 on our diluted earnings per share.

The following explanation of certain items that impacted the comparability of our 2013 results with 2012 has been provided to support
investors’ understanding of our performance. Our 2013 results were affected by the following:

•

The recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $1.0 billion, primarily related to (i) a $483 million charge to impair goodwill associated
with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $262 million of charges to



impair certain landfills, primarily in our Eastern Canada Area; (iii) $144 million of charges to write down the carrying value of three waste-to-energy facilities and (iv) $71 million
of impairment charges relating to investments in waste diversion technology companies. These items had a negative impact of $1.91 on our diluted earnings per share; and

•

The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $23 million primarily related to our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI as well as our 2012 restructuring and other charges. These items had a negative impact of $0.03
on our diluted earnings per share.

Our 2012 results were affected by the following:

•

The recognition of pre-tax impairment charges aggregating $109 million attributable primarily to facilities in our medical waste services business and investments in waste diversion technologies. These items had
a negative impact of $0.17 on our diluted earnings per share;

•

The recognition of pre-tax costs aggregating $82 million primarily related to our July 2012 restructuring as well as integration costs associated with our acquisition of Oakleaf. These items had a negative impact
of $0.11 on our diluted earnings per share;

The recognition of a pre-tax charge of $10 million related to the withdrawal
from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and a pre-tax charge of $6 million resulting from a labor union dispute. These items had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share; and

•

The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $10 million related to an accrual for legal reserves and the impact of a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our environmental remediation
liabilities. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share.

We began the year with a focus
on growing earnings and free cash flow, increasing yield and exercising discipline around capital spending and costs, and the Company’s execution on these goals translated into strong overall operating results in 2014. Additionally, we
increased the amount we returned to stockholders in 2014 compared to 2013 by increasing our dividend and share repurchases. Our fourth quarter results capitalized on the momentum we built throughout the year, delivering growth in income from
operations and income from operations margin in our Solid Waste business that we expect to continue into 2015. During the fourth quarter, we also completed our previously announced divestiture of our Wheelabrator business for cash proceeds of
$1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We intend to use these proceeds in support of our strategic growth plans to drive long-term stockholder value, with our priority being on making accretive
acquisitions in our Solid Waste business. We also expect our focus on our five key priorities set forth above — Customers; Traditional Waste Business; Growth; Yield Management and Costs – to translate into continued strong free cash
flow to pay our dividends, repurchase shares and make other growth investments, while continuing our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet.

Free Cash Flow

As
is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating
activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund
acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure.
However, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. Nevertheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or
that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements.



Our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to “Net cash provided by operating
activities” is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies:

When comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the
comparable period in 2013, the decrease of $124 million is primarily related to higher income tax payments of $247 million in the current year and a payment of $36 million made in the first quarter of 2014 to terminate our forward starting swaps.
These decreases were partially offset by higher cash earnings and favorable working capital changes.

When comparing our cash flows from
operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 to the comparable period in 2012, the increase of $160 million was primarily related to the impact of higher cash earnings, favorable impacts of working capital changes and the payment
of $59 million to settle the liabilities associated with the termination of our forward starting swaps in September 2012. The increase was partially offset by an increase in tax payments of $145 million and the favorable cash receipt of $72 million
resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in April 2012.

The decrease in capital expenditures when comparing the year ended
December 31, 2014 to the comparable period in 2013 and comparing the year ended December 31, 2013 to the comparable period in 2012 can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management.

The increase in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) for the year ended December 31, 2014
from the comparable period in 2013 is largely driven by (i) the sale of our Wheelabrator business in the fourth quarter of 2014 for $1.95 billion; (ii) the sale of our investment in Shanghai Environment Group (“SEG”), which was
part of our Wheelabrator business, in the first quarter of 2014 for $155 million; (iii) the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter of 2014, for proceeds of $80 million,
including $65 million in cash; (iv) the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter of 2014 for $39 million and (v) the sale of a vacant facility in the second quarter of 2014 for $19
million.

Pending Acquisition

On September 17, 2014, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc., one of
the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest. Closing of the acquisition is expected to occur in early 2015, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Acquisitions

Greenstar, LLC

— On January 31, 2013, we paid $170 million inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Greenstar, LLC
(“Greenstar”). Pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement, up to an additional $40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018, of which $20 million is guaranteed. The remaining $20 million of this consideration
is contingent based on changes in certain recyclable commodity indexes and



had an estimated fair value at closing of $16 million. Greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. This acquisition provides the Company’s customers with greater
access to recycling solutions, having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers.

RCI Environnement, Inc.

— On July 5, 2013, we paid C$509 million, or $481 million, to acquire substantially all of the assets
of RCI Environnement, Inc. (“RCI”), the largest waste management company in Quebec, and certain related entities. Total consideration, inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital, was C$515 million, or $487 million. RCI provides
collection, transfer, recycling and disposal operations throughout the Greater Montreal area. The acquired RCI operations complement and expand the Company’s existing assets and operations in Quebec.

Divestitures

Divestiture of Wheelabrator Business

On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95
billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual
items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally
provide for fixed volume commitments, with certain market price resets, for up to seven years.

Wheelabrator provides waste-to-energy
services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. Wheelabrator owns or operates 16 waste-to-energy facilities and four independent power production plants. Prior to the sale, our Wheelabrator business
constituted a reportable segment for the Company, as discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We concluded that the sale of our Wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under current
authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the long-term waste supply agreements referred to above and in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Divestitures

In
the second quarter of 2014, we sold our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets which were included in Tier 3 and Tier 1, respectively, of our Solid Waste business. We received proceeds from the sale of $80 million,
consisting of $65 million of cash and $15 million of preferred stock and recognized a loss on the sale of $25 million.

In the third
quarter of 2014, we sold certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area, which were included in Tier 3. We received cash proceeds from the sale of $39 million and recognized a gain of $18 million.

The gain or loss on these divestitures is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill)
and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remaining proceeds from divestitures in 2014 were comprised substantially of cash. Additional information on our reportable segments can be found in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Information

Comprehensive Income

— In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amended authoritative
guidance associated with comprehensive income, which requires companies to provide



information about the amounts that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Additionally, companies are required to present significant amounts reclassified
out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. The amendment to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income was effective for the Company on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We have presented the information required by this amendment in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing

— In July 2012, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with
indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more
likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the
entity is not required to take further action. The amendments were effective for indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012; however, early adoption was permitted. The
Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure
of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be
calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the
greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items is discussed
in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.

Landfills

Accounting for
landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement
obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping
event.

Landfill Costs

— We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and
expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and
landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill
buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts
previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs.

Final Capping Costs

— We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping
materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final



capping costs to specific final capping events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the
related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events
immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a
final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Closure and Post-Closure Costs

— We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and
regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The
possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required
liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not
been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are
responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion
airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received
within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and

•

Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must
meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy
provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and
circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 23 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2014, five landfills required the



Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Two of these landfills required approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition
that could impede the expansion process. The remaining three landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one- or five-year requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs
for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is
established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement
that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated
access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is
reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its
highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our
landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets
associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts
change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure
activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be
significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that
expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the
decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may
have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and
certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a
number of estimates and assumptions.

Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate
sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation,



considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site.
Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service
providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.

Asset Impairments

Our
long-lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential
impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These
events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the
asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can
identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally
determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar
assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is
included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and
projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.

There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described below.

Landfills

— The assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills
and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a
regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a
landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets
because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation
approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Expansion
Airspace

above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit.



At December 31, 2014, one of our landfill sites for which we believe receipt of the expansion permit is probable, is not currently accepting waste. The net recorded capitalized landfill
asset cost for this site was $247 million at December 31, 2014. We performed a test of recoverability for this landfill and the undiscounted cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the
carrying value of this site. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of
2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of
permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these
landfills could be avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the carrying values of
landfill assets were no longer able to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use
of the assets.

(Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill)

and

Unusual Items

and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to landfill asset impairments recognized during the
reported periods.

Goodwill

— At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess our goodwill for impairment using
Level 3 inputs.

We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative
assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we
determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment.

If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment
identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second
step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable. The income approach is based on the long-term
projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent
in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our
business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to the
reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to
our reporting units.

Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future
operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we
believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units.



During our annual 2013 impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of
our Wheelabrator business had declined and the associated goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $483 million, which had no related tax benefit. We estimated the implied fair value of our Wheelabrator reporting
unit goodwill using a combination of income and market approaches. Because the annual impairment test indicated that Wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, we performed the “step two” analysis. In
the “step two” analysis, the fair values of all assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, power contracts, customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of
goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. The factors contributing to the $483 million goodwill impairment charge principally related to the
continued challenging business environment in areas of the country in which Wheelabrator operated, characterized by lower available disposal volumes (which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue, as well as the amount of electricity
Wheelabrator was able to generate), lower electricity pricing due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as Wheelabrator’s facilities aged. These factors caused us to lower prior assumptions
for electricity and disposal revenue, and increase assumed operating costs. Additionally, the discount factor previously utilized in the income approach in 2013 increased mainly due to increases in interest rates. In 2013, we incurred an additional
$10 million of charges to impair goodwill associated with our Puerto Rico operations and $4 million to impair goodwill associated with our recycling business. In 2014, we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our
recycling operations.

See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Goodwill Impairments

and Notes 6 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill

— At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess
indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment.

When performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived
intangible assets, we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe an impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing
the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value.

Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We
discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is
appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business.

Fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic
projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that this method
provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income
tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are
reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.



Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax
return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. To the extent interest and
penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Insured and Self-Insured Claims

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers’
compensation insurance programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if
future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Results of Operations

Operating
Revenues

Our operating revenues set forth below have generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, transfer,
recycling and resource recovery, and waste-to-energy services and from sales of commodities by our recycling, waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy operations. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection
frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or MRF and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally
based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and
disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue generally consists of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. The fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally
include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel. Our recently divested Wheelabrator business provided waste-to-energy services and managed waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. We also
provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste or Wheelabrator businesses, including Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”), Energy and Environmental Services, recycling brokerage and electronic recycling
services, landfill gas-to-energy services, and expanded service offerings and solutions. We also offer portable self-storage services through a joint venture; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our LampTracker

program; portable restroom servicing under the name Port-o-Let

®

and street and parking lot sweeping services. In addition, we hold
interests in oil and gas producing properties. These operations are presented as “Other” in the table below. The following table summarizes revenues during each period (in millions):

(ii)

Average revenue growth for yield for “Collection and disposal” excludes all electricity-related revenues generated by our Wheelabrator business and our landfill gas-to-energy operations, which are reported as
“Electricity” revenues.

Our revenues increased $13 million, or 0.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Our revenue fluctuation in the current period has been driven by (i) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations; (ii) revenue from acquired operations, particularly the RCI operations acquired in July 2013, which
contributed approximately $77 million to the revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2014; and (iii) fluctuations in electricity prices at Wheelabrator’s merchant waste-to-energy facilities that favorably affected revenues.
Offsetting these revenue increases were (i) revenue declines due to lower volumes; (ii) divestitures, primarily our Puerto Rico divestiture in the second quarter of 2014, certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada
Area in the third quarter of 2014, and our Wheelabrator business in December 2014; (iii) foreign currency translation, which affects revenues from our Canadian operations; and (iv) revenue declines resulting from lower recyclable commodity
prices.

Our revenues increased $334 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our revenue fluctuation in the prior
period was driven by (i) revenue from acquired operations, particularly Greenstar acquired in January 2013 and RCI, which increased revenues by $138 million and $80 million, respectively; (ii) increased revenue growth from our collection
and disposal average yield; (iii) higher revenues provided by



our fuel surcharge program; and (iv) fluctuations in electricity prices at our merchant waste-to-energy facilities. Offsetting these revenue increases were (i) revenue declines
resulting from lower recyclable commodity prices; (ii) foreign currency translation, which negatively affected revenues from our Canadian operations; and (iii) revenue declines due to lower volumes.

The following provides further details associated with our period-to-period change in revenues.

Average yield

Collection and disposal average yield

— This measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our
collection, transfer, landfill and waste-to-energy disposal operations, exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also
(i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to both the types of services provided and the geographic locations where our services are provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost
business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers.

Revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield was $262 million,
or 2.3%, and $235 million, or 2.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

We experienced growth in all three
of our principal collection lines of business in both 2014 and 2013. The details are as follows (dollars in millions):

Our year-over-year yield growth in both 2014 and 2013 was driven largely by our pricing strategy that combines
focused effort on price increases with lower rollbacks. Conversely, our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy, with more significant volume declines during 2014. However, our pricing strategy and our focus
on controlling variable costs have consistently provided margin improvements in our collection line of business, although we have seen margin deterioration in our residential line of business throughout 2014. Other drivers affecting the current
period average yield include:

•

A fee instituted in April 2013 to help us recover a portion of the significant regulatory costs and fees, such as host fees and disposal taxes, which have not been recouped by our pricing programs. Revenues generated
from this fee are approximately $97 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally in our collection business, with the most significant impact in our commercial line of business.

•

Revenue growth from yield in our industrial line of business was aided by our Energy Services business, which typically has higher average rates due to extended transportation distances, special waste handling costs and
higher disposal costs as compared with our typical industrial business.

•

Our focus on bidding on residential contracts to improve our yield performance and increase our overall returns. Our effort to increase yield in our residential line of business is a challenge principally due to a very
competitive environment. A high percentage of our residential business is in municipal franchise markets, and many municipalities are facing significant budget challenges, which results in increased competition on the basis of price as we rebid
contracts and try to win new contracts.



•

Yield growth from our landfill and transfer station operations also improved slightly for both 2014 and 2013.

Recycling commodities

— Decreases in the prices of the recycling commodities we sell resulted in revenue declines of $53 million
and $79 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared with the same prior year period.

Fuel
surcharges and mandated fees —

These revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, decreased $2 million and increased $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These revenues
fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. We experienced a fuel price decline of approximately 2.4% in 2014, which caused a slight decrease in our fuel surcharge revenues. These
revenues increased in 2013 resulting from a revision of the surcharge calculation implemented to better capture price increases intended to be recovered by the surcharge. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to
pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations.

Volume

— Declines in our volume caused our revenue to decrease $188 million, or 1.4%, and $133 million, or 1.0%, for the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, as compared with prior year periods, driven primarily by declines in our collection business. Our volume fluctuations are generally attributable to economic conditions, pricing changes,
competition and diversion of waste by customers. Our revenue growth due to volume has been negatively affected by our pricing strategy. We are experiencing volume declines due to the loss of low margin customers that we are not willing to keep at
current rates. Additionally, we are experiencing losses of certain municipal contracts that are up for bid. As a result of both the very competitive environment and our focus on reasonable returns, we continue to face challenges to keep existing
contracts and to win new contracts. Finally, we experienced revenue declines associated with the loss of certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization.

Other drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for the periods presented include:

•

We experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes in our material recovery facilities in 2014 primarily driven by the rationalization of our underperforming assets. Revenue increased due to higher volumes in
2013 driven by additional recycling capacity that we added in 2012.

•

We experienced revenue declines of approximately $23 million associated with the severe winter weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014.

•

We experienced higher landfill volumes in both comparable periods primarily driven by our municipal solid waste business. In addition, higher special waste volumes in the Southern U.S. also contributed to our higher
landfill volumes in 2014.

•

We experienced revenue increases due to higher volumes in our ancillary services, primarily driven by increases in our Energy and Environmental Services, our WM Renewable Energy Program and our portable self-storage
services in 2014.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

— Revenues increased $124 million and $292 million for the
years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to acquisitions. The revenue increase due to acquisitions in both 2014 and 2013 was principally associated with the RCI operations acquired in July 2013. To a lesser extent, 2013
revenues increased due to the acquisition of Greenstar in January of that year, which is reported in our “Recycling” line of business.

These revenues were offset partially by revenue decreases of $90 million and $6 million due to divestitures for the years ended 2014 and 2013,
respectively. The revenue decrease in 2014 is primarily due to (i) our divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter of 2014; (ii) the divestiture of certain landfill and
collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter of 2014; and (iii) the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014.



Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs
discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party
disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste
collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs,
which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill
lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate
and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include auto liability, workers’ compensation, general liability and insurance and claim costs and
(x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies.

Our operating expenses decreased $110 million, or 1.2%, when comparing 2014 with 2013 and increased $233 million, or 2.6%, when comparing 2013
with 2012. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 64.3% in 2014, 65.2% in 2013, and 65.1% in 2012.

Divestitures

— During 2014, we divested our Wheelabrator business in the fourth quarter, our Puerto Rico
operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter, and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter. As mentioned above, we estimate that divestitures reduced our annual
revenues by $90 million. Commensurately, we estimate our operating expenses decreased by approximately $56 million due to divestitures when compared to the prior year period. The decreases in costs were primarily in (i) labor and related
benefits and (ii) maintenance and repairs.

The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including
the impact of foreign currency translation, for the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions), with significant changes in our operating expenses discussed below:

Labor and related benefits

— The following significant items affected the
comparability of expenses for the periods presented.



The decrease in labor and related benefits in 2014 as compared with 2013 was due to:

•

Lower headcount and contract labor due to lower volumes in our collection line of business and operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business;

•

Lower costs resulting from recent divestitures, particularly the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations, offset in part by;

•

Higher wages due to merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2013 and 2014; and

•

Increased health and welfare costs.

The increase in labor and related benefits in 2013 as
compared with 2012 was due to:

•

Higher wages due to merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2013;

•

Higher incentive compensation expense in 2013;

•

Higher contract labor principally attributed to the recycling line of business;

•

Recent acquisitions, principally the Greenstar acquisition, offset in part by; and

•

Lower headcount resulting principally from the flexing of our costs in response to lower collection volumes.

Maintenance and repairs

— The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by (i) the Greenstar acquisition and
(ii) higher internal shop labor costs due in part to higher incentive compensation and merit increases.

Subcontractor costs
—

The increase in 2014 was driven by (i) remediation services within our Energy and Environmental Services business and (ii) the RCI operations acquired in July 2013; offset in part by the volume decline related to the loss of
certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization. The decrease in 2013 was driven primarily by the volume decline associated with the loss of certain large accounts in our WMSBS organization. These decreases were offset, in part, by higher
costs associated with the acquired RCI operations.

Cost of goods sold —

The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2014 is due to
(i) increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers; (ii) better alignment of rebate structures to commodity prices for new recycling contracts; (iii) ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around
inbound quality control and (iv) lower commodity prices. These cost decreases were offset in part by our business in portable self-storage services and remediation services. The increase in cost of goods sold in 2013 is due in large
part to higher customer rebates resulting from higher volumes in our recycling commodity business driven primarily by the acquired Greenstar operations.

Fuel —

The decrease in fuel expense in both 2014 and 2013 when compared to the prior year periods was driven by (i) lower
fuel purchases due to reduced collection volumes; (ii) lower costs resulting from the conversion of our fleet to CNG vehicles; (iii) lower fuel prices and (iv) retroactive CNG fuel excise credits.

Disposal and franchise fees and taxes—

The increase in costs in both 2014 and 2013 can be attributable to (i) higher
disposal fees and taxes due to higher landfill volumes and (ii) higher municipal franchise fees relating to the collection line of business. A disposal surcharge at one of our waste-to-energy facilities in 2013 affected the comparability in
both periods.

Landfill operating costs —

Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods
presented include (i) unfavorable adjustments in 2014 and 2012 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery rates
and (ii) higher leachate costs for all comparable periods.



Risk management —

The decrease in costs in 2014 was primarily due to lower auto
and general liability claims and, to a lesser extent, decreased workers’ compensation, claims and lower truck insurance expenses. The increase in costs in 2013 was driven principally by higher workers’ compensation claims.

Other —

The decrease in 2014 is primarily due to the gain on the sale of a vacant facility and lower rental costs. The increased
costs in 2013 when compared to 2012 were due in part to (i) higher telecommunications costs driven by our initiative to equip our fleet with onboard computers; (ii) higher utilities; (iii) higher property taxes and (iv) lower
gains on the sale of assets. These increases were offset, in part, by favorable adjustments to contingent consideration associated with acquisitions.

Selling, General and Administrative

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefit costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related
insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for
uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, travel and
entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13 million, or 0.9%, and decreased by $4 million, or 0.3%, when comparing
2014 with 2013 and 2013 with 2012, respectively. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.6% in 2014, 10.5% in 2013 and 10.8% in 2012.

Labor and related benefits

— Factors affecting the year-over-year changes in our labor and related
benefits costs include:

•

Merit increases;

•

Higher incentive compensation cost, particularly in 2013, as compared with the prior year periods, including bonuses and equity-based compensation;

•

Higher health and welfare costs in 2014 as compared to 2013; and

•

Year-over-year labor and related benefits cost savings of approximately $40 million in 2014 and $45 million in 2013 from restructuring plans implemented in 2014 and 2012.

Professional fees

— Our professional fees continued to decline during 2014 as a result of our concerted effort to reduce
consulting fees. Our 2013 consulting fees were lower as we incurred significant fees during 2012 resulting from company-wide initiatives. The lower consulting fees were partially offset by higher legal fees in 2014 as compared to 2013.



Provision for bad debts

— Our provision for bad debts decreased in 2013 as compared
to 2012 primarily as a result of (i) the collection of certain fully reserved receivables related to our Puerto Rico operations and (ii) resolution of billing delay issues experienced during 2012 in our WMSBS organization.

Other

— In 2014, increased costs resulting principally from litigation settlements were partially offset by a decline in
controllable costs associated with advertising and travel and entertainment costs. In 2013, controllable costs associated with (i) building and equipment; (ii) advertising; (iii) computer and telecommunication; (iv) travel
and entertainment and (v) seminars and education declined primarily as a result of our July 2012 restructuring and focus on cost-control initiatives.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a
straight-line basis from three to 50 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on
a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our Company-specific criteria for amortization purposes;
(iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and
(iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the
type of asset.

The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2014 is primarily attributable to favorable
adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates and fixed asset depreciation that was suspended when our Wheelabrator business was classified as held-for-sale in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequently sold in December 2014. The increase
in amortization of intangible assets in 2013 that continued in 2014 is primarily related to the amortization of customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of RCI.

Restructuring

In
August 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several Corporate functions to better support achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, including cost reduction. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried
employees within these organizations. Approximately 650 employees have separated from our Corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring, but we do not anticipate that all of these positions will be permanently
eliminated.

During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which
$70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. We do not expect to incur any material charges associated with
our 2014 restructuring in future periods.



During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a total of $18 million of pre-tax
restructuring charges, of which $7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with our acquisitions of Greenstar and RCI and our 2012 restructurings. The remaining charges were primarily related to
operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

In July 2012, we announced a reorganization of operations,
designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. Principal organizational changes included removing the management layer of our four geographic Groups, each of which
previously constituted a reportable segment, and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic Areas through which we evaluate and oversee our Solid Waste subsidiaries from 22 to 17. This reorganization eliminated approximately 700
employee positions throughout the Company, including positions at both the management and support level. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a total of $67 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $56 million were
primarily related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with these reorganizations. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

Goodwill Impairments

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling
operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $509 million of goodwill impairment charges, primarily related to (i) $483 million associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $10 million associated with our
Puerto Rico operations and (iii) $9 million associated with a majority-owned waste diversion technology company. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $4 million related to certain of our
non-Solid Waste operations. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Critical Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments

and Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net income of $170 million, primarily related to
the following:

•

(Income) expense from divestitures

— We recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of
certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets. Refer to Note 19 for
additional information related to our divestitures.

•

Oil and gas properties impairments

— We recognized $272 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties,
primarily as a result of the pronounced decrease in oil and gas prices



in the fourth quarter of 2014. We wrote down the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value using an income approach.

•

Other impairments

— We recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized net charges of $464 million, primarily related to the
following:

•

Landfill impairments

— We recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to
actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these
landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be
avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the landfill assets were no longer able
to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote them down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets.

•

Waste-to-energy impairments

— We recognized $144 million of impairment charges relating to three waste-to-energy facilities, primarily as a result of closure or anticipated closure due to continued
difficulty securing sufficient volumes to operate the plants at capacity and the prospect of additional capacity entering the market where the largest facility is located. We wrote down the carrying value of our facilities to their estimated
fair value using a market approach.

•

Other impairments

— The remainder of our 2013 charges were attributable to (i) $31 million of charges to impair various recycling assets; (ii) $20 million of charges to write down assets related to
a majority-owned waste diversion technology company and (iii) a $15 million charge to write down the carrying value of an oil and gas property to its estimated fair value.

•

Divestitures —

Partially offsetting these charges were $8 million of net gains on divestitures.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized impairment charges of $79 million, attributable to (i) $45 million of charges
related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities; (ii) $20 million of charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies and
(iii) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values, all of which are individually immaterial.

See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Critical Accounting
Estimates and Assumptions — Asset Impairments

for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments.

In addition to the impairments discussed above, we are continuing to evaluate opportunities associated with the sale or discontinued use of
assets that may no longer meet our strategic objectives or are underperforming. Accordingly, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded as assets are sold or become held-for-sale.

Items affecting the
comparability of our results of operations include (i) charges associated with our August 2014 and July 2012 restructurings; (ii) subsequent benefits realized as a result of these restructurings and ongoing cost containment efforts;
(iii) increased labor costs due to merit increases effective in 2014 and 2013 and (iv) lower 2012 year-over-year incentive compensation costs.

Solid Waste —

The comparability of our income from operations for the periods presented is driven by $279 million of net
charges primarily related to impairments recognized in 2013. The most significant impairment charges were in our Eastern Canada Area, which is included in Tier 3, and were associated with the impairment of certain landfills as discussed above in

(Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items

. Other significant items affecting the results of operations of our Solid Waste business during the three years ended December 31, 2014 are
summarized below:

•

Our base business benefited from (i) internal revenue growth, principally in our collection and disposal business; (ii) increased fuel cost recovery and (iii) decreased fuel costs. These favorable
variances were offset, in part, by net cost increases driven by higher operating expenses in 2013;

•

Results from our recycling business contributed favorably in 2014 when compared to the prior period principally due to (i) increased efforts to reduce controllable recycling rebates paid to customers;
(ii) better alignment of rebate structures to commodity prices for new recycling contracts and (iii) ongoing business improvement efforts around inbound quality control. These favorable variances more than offset lower market prices for
recyclable commodities and lower volumes. Results from our recycling business contributed unfavorably in 2013 when compared to the prior period primarily due to (i) lower prices for commodities; (ii) higher processing costs driven in part
by increased outbound quality control in 2013 and (iii) operating losses related to the operations of Greenstar acquired in 2013.

In addition, the following items affected comparability of 2014 to 2013 within specific segments:

•

The loss on the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets in 2014, which were included in Tier 3 and Tier 1, respectively;

•

Adverse weather in the first quarter of 2014 unfavorably affected income from operations primarily in Tier 2;

•

The gain on the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in 2014, which were included in Tier 3;

•

The accretive benefits of the RCI operations acquired in July 2013, which are included in Tier 3;



•

The gain on the sale of a vacant facility in 2014, which was included in Tier 3; and

•

A reversal of a reserve in 2014 due to a favorable litigation resolution, which was included in Tier 1.

In addition, the following items affected comparability of 2013 to 2012 within specific segments:

•

A decrease in bad debt expense during 2013 due primarily to the collection of receivables previously reserved during 2012, principally in Puerto Rico, which was included in Tier 3;

•

The accretive benefits of the RCI operations acquired, as discussed above;

•

A charge for the withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan in New England in 2012, which is included in Tier 2; and

•

Incremental operating expenses due to a labor union dispute in the Pacific Northwest Area in 2012, which is included in Tier 3.

Wheelabrator —

The most significant items affecting the results of operations of our Wheelabrator business in 2014 and 2013 were
(i) a $519 million gain on sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014 and (ii) $627 million of pre-tax charges to impair goodwill and certain waste-to-energy facilities in 2013 as discussed above in

Goodwill Impairments

and

(Income) Expense from Divestitures, Asset Impairments (Other than Goodwill) and Unusual Items.

Other items contributing to the variability included (i) higher year-over-year electricity prices at our merchant waste-to-energy facilities
and (ii) impairment charges at a waste-to-energy facility as a result of projected operating losses in 2013.

Other

— Our
“Other” income from operations includes (i) those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our Energy and Environmental Services and Renewable Energy
organizations, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services and (iii) the results of investments that we are making in expanded service offerings, such
as portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp recycling, and in oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and
self-insurance support for our Solid Waste.

Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include:

•

Net charges of $339 million and $59 million primarily related to impairments recognized in 2014 and 2013, respectively;

•

Improved results in our Strategic Business Solutions as a result of our system and process enhancements;

•

Favorable adjustments in 2014 and 2013 to contingent consideration associated with the Greenstar acquisition, offset by higher administrative and restructuring costs associated with the acquired operations in
2013; and

•

Improved results in our organics and medical waste services in 2013.

Corporate and
Other —

Significant items affecting the comparability of expenses for the periods presented include:

•

Restructuring charges recognized in 2014 and subsequent benefits realized as a result of the restructuring;

•

Charges for the settlement of a legal dispute and related fees in 2014;

•

Increased health and welfare costs in 2014;



•

Unfavorable adjustments in both 2014 and 2012 as well as favorable adjustments in 2013 related to changes in U.S. Treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation obligations and
recovery assets;

•

Our professional fees continued to decline during 2014 as a result of our concerted effort to reduce consulting fees. Our 2013 consulting fees were lower as we incurred significant fees during 2012 resulting from
company-wide initiatives; and

•

Favorable risk management allocation in 2014 and higher year-over-year risk management expense in 2013 primarily due to increased overall costs associated with auto and general liability insurance.

Interest Expense, net

Our interest expense, net was $466 million in 2014, $477 million in 2013 and $484 million in 2012. During 2014, the decrease in interest
expense was primarily attributable to (i) the impacts that lower market interest rates have had on certain of our tax-exempt debt; (ii) issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and
(iii) reduced costs associated with our letter of credit facilities due to improvements in the Company’s overall credit rating. These decreases were partially offset by increases in expense associated with our terminated interest rate
swaps due to the maturity of the underlying senior notes. In December 2014, the Company decided to redeem $947 million of senior notes due in 2015, 2017 and 2019 with a weighted average coupon rate of 7.0%. The Company incurred a make-whole
premium of $130 million to repay these notes with available cash in January 2015. We anticipate that a near-term refinancing of these debt balances will reduce interest expense in future years.

During 2013, our debt balances increased by approximately $300 million, which can generally be attributed to the debt financing of our
acquisition of RCI offset by debt repayments. In spite of this increase in debt, we reduced our interest costs by (i) reducing the interest rate periods of some of our tax-exempt bonds, allowing us to benefit from lower rates available for
shorter-term remarketings; (ii) issuing new debt at lower fixed interest rates than debt repaid upon scheduled maturities and (iii) reducing the cost of our revolving credit facility by amending the credit agreement to provide for lower
fees and rates.

Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities

We recognized “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities” of $53 million, $34 million and $46 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. These losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in two limited liability companies established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility, as well as (i) noncontrolling
investments made to support our strategic initiatives and (ii) unconsolidated trusts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental obligations. The tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties
and the refined coal facility are discussed below in

Provision for Income Taxes.

Refer to Notes 9 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to these investments. The expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was
impacted by charges of $11 million in 2014 primarily to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value. The expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was impacted by a charge of $10 million in 2012 related
to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an equity method investment in an unconsolidated entity that went into liquidation.

Other, net

We
recognized other, net expense of $29 million, $74 million and $18 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were impacted by impairment charges of $22 million, $71 million and $16 million, respectively,
related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies which were accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down our investments to their fair value which was primarily determined using an
income approach based on estimated



future cash flow projections and, to a lesser extent, third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities. Partially offsetting the 2013 charges was a $4 million gain on the sale
of a similar investment. The remaining expenses recognized during the reported periods are primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation.

Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded provisions for income taxes of $413 million in 2014, $364 million in 2013 and $443 million in 2012. These tax provisions resulted
in an effective income tax rate of approximately 23.6%, 73.8% and 34.0% for the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is primarily
affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) the tax implications of divestitures; (iii) federal tax credits; (iv) adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes; (v) tax audit settlements;
(vi) the realization of federal and state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards and (vii) the tax implications of impairments. The impacts of these items are summarized below:

•

Tax Implications of Divestitures

— During 2014, the Company recorded a net gain of $515 million primarily related to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and
certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $138 million. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information related to divestitures.

•

Investment in Refined Coal Facility

— Our refined coal facility investment and the resulting federal tax credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $21 million, $20 million and $21 million for
the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our refined coal facility investment.

•

Investment in Low-Income Housing Properties

— Our low-income housing properties investment and the resulting federal tax credits reduced our provision for income taxes by $37 million, $38 million and
$38 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our low-income housing properties investment.

•

Adjustments to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes

— Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns and changes in state law resulted in a reduction
of $24 million and increases of $4 million and $7 million to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

•

Tax Audit Settlements

— The settlement of various tax audits resulted in reductions to our provision for income taxes of $12 million, $11 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31,
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

•

State Net Operating Loss and Credit Carry-forwards

— During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income
taxes of $16 million, $16 million and $5 million, respectively.

•

Federal Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards

— During 2012, we recognized additional federal net operating loss carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $8 million.

•

Tax Implications of Impairments

— A portion of the impairment charges recognized are not deductible for tax purposes. Had the charges been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have
been reduced by $8 million, $235 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively. See Notes 6 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to asset impairments and
unusual items.

We expect our 2015 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 36.0% based on projected income before
income taxes, federal tax credits and other permanent items.



The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law on December 19, 2014 and
included an extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2015 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on
2014 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2014 although it will reduce our future cash taxes by approximately $60 million. Taking accelerated deductions
results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures would have otherwise been taken.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million in 2014, $32 million in 2013 and $43 million in 2012. These amounts are
principally related to third parties’ equity interests in two limited liability companies (“LLCs”) that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by our Wheelabrator business. In December 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling
interests in the LLCs from the third parties in anticipation of our sale of the Wheelabrator business. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment of our Wheelabrator business. Refer to Notes 19 and 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for information related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities, respectively.

The decrease in 2013 is primarily due to the net loss of $10 million attributable to noncontrolling interest holders associated with the $20
million impairment charge related to a majority-owned waste diversion technology company discussed above in

Landfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis

We owned or operated 247 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2014 and 262 solid waste and five secure
hazardous waste landfills at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the expected remaining capacity, in cubic yards and tonnage of waste that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills, is shown below (in millions):

Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2014 and projected annual disposal volumes, the
weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 46 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of
permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are
seeking expansion permits at 23 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

section above. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or
permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 49 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume.



The number of landfills we own or operate as of December 31, 2014, segregated by their
estimated operating lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:

(a)

Landfills we operate through lease agreements are similar to landfills we own because we own the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life
of the landfill. We are usually responsible for the final capping, closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease.

(b)

For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. However, we are generally responsible for final capping, closure and
post-closure obligations under the operating contracts.

The following table reflects landfill capacity and airspace
changes, as measured in tons of waste, for landfills owned or operated by us during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

(b)

We received expansion permits at eight of our landfills during 2014 and 12 of our landfills during 2013, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal
capacity of our existing landfills.

(c)

Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed
in the future. Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and
projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate; and operating
practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and increasing initial compaction
through improved landfill equipment, operations and training.

These amounts include 1.2 million tons at December 31, 2014 and 1.5 million tons at December 31, 2013, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were
redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects.

When a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the
management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. As of December 31, 2014, our closed sites management group managed 210 closed landfills.

Landfill Assets

— We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include
expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring
equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs
associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.

The following table
reflects the total cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace amortization as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2014 (in millions):

As of December 31, 2014, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2015, and
approximately $800 million in 2016 and 2017 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events, and spending estimates are subject to change due to
fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations.



Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— As we accept waste at our
landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance
associated with accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was
caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely
remedy can be reasonably estimated.

The following table reflects our landfill liabilities and our environmental remediation liabilities
as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and summarizes significant changes in these amounts during 2014 (in millions):

Landfill Costs and Expenses

— As disclosed in the

Operating Expenses

section above, our
landfill operating costs include interest accretion on asset retirement obligations, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment,
landfill remediation costs, and other landfill site costs. The following table summarizes these costs for each of the three years indicated (in millions):

$


The comparison of these costs for the reported periods has been significantly affected by accounting for
changes in the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and environmental remediation recovery assets, which is based on the rate for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating
the weighted-average period until settlement of the underlying obligations.

Amortization of landfill airspace, which is included as a
component of “Depreciation and amortization” expense, includes the following:

•

the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our
landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and



•

the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset
retirement costs.

Amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The
rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are
generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total airspace capacity. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a
specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated airspace capacity. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates.

The following table presents our landfill airspace amortization expense on a per-ton basis:

Years Ended December 31,

$


$


$


Tons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)




Average landfill airspace amortization expense per ton

$

3.96

$

4.29

$

4.30

Different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 252 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates
vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and
post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the
mix of volumes we receive across the Company year-over-year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs
and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we
have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery
facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital
expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. We also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments, and we have also returned value to our shareholders
through share repurchases.



Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term
interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase. The increase at December 31, 2014 is primarily related to the December 2014 sale of our Wheelabrator business.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

— Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds deposited for purposes of
settling landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. These balances are primarily included within “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The “Other” balance at
December 31, 2014 includes the $29.2 million funding of a legal settlement pending final court approval for disbursement.

Debt

— We use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis,
but we also use other instruments and facilities when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2014 are described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013 were primarily attributable to (i) the use
of cash proceeds from the sale of our Wheelabrator business to temporarily repay outstanding borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility; (ii) the use of cash generated from our Canadian operations to reduce the balance of our
Canadian term loan and (iii) the impacts of other non-cash changes in our debt balances due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, foreign currency translation, interest accretion and capital leases and other debt obligations.

Our current debt balances as of December 31, 2014, are primarily related to $947 million of senior notes that the Company decided to
redeem in advance of their scheduled maturity, including $350 million of 6.375% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2015, $147 million of 7.125% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in December 2017 and $450 million of 7.375%
senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2019. We repaid these notes and the related make-whole premium and accrued interest with available cash in January 2015. We anticipate that a near-term refinancing of these debt balances will
reduce interest expense in future years.



We have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The
following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit (in millions) at December 31, categorized by type of facility:

In July 2013, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, increasing our total credit capacity to $2.25 billion and extending the term through July 2018. At December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding
borrowings and $785 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,465 million.

(b)

As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $400 million under letter of credit facilities with terms extending through December 2018. This letter of credit capacity was fully utilized as of
December 31, 2014.

(c)

These letters of credit are outstanding under various arrangements that do not obligate the counterparty to provide a committed capacity.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

— The most significant items affecting the comparisons
of our operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 are summarized below:

•

Increase in earnings

– Our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $1.2 billion, on a year-over-year basis. Certain of the more significant drivers of our earnings
improvement include:

•

Lower non-cash impairment charges of $652 million in 2014 as compared to 2013; and

•

The net gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business of $519 million in 2014.

After
considering these items, and certain other non-cash items included in our comparative results, our earnings drove an improvement in our cash flows from operating activities of approximately $100 million.

•

Increase in tax payments

— Cash paid for income taxes was approximately $247 million higher on a year-over-year basis due to (i) higher pre-tax earnings; (ii) approximately $210 million anticipated
overpayment during 2014, when comparing our year-end tax provisions to payments made throughout the year; and (iii) taxes associated with the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets.

•

Forward starting swaps

— During the first quarter of 2014, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with the anticipated issuance of senior notes in 2014 matured, and we paid cash of $36 million
to settle the liabilities related to the swaps. This cash payment has been classified as a change in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows.



•

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures

— Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted on a year-over-year basis by changes in our working
capital accounts. Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable changes,
which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
operating cash flows in 2013 as compared with 2012 are summarized below:

•

Earnings change

— Our 2013 earnings drove our improved net cash provided by operating activities in spite of a year-over-year decrease in income from operations, of $772 million. Our income from operations
decline resulted from higher non-cash charges during 2013 of $945 million, associated principally with higher impairment charges. Absent these non-cash charges, we experienced higher earnings, which resulted in cash flow expansion.

•

Increased income tax payments

— Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $144 million higher on a year-over-year basis. Note that,
while pre-tax income on a year-over-year basis has declined $809 million, a significant portion of the 2013 impairments discussed above do not qualify for a tax benefit. See

Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items

below for additional
information.

•

Forward starting swaps

— During the third quarter of 2012, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances were terminated contemporaneously with the actual
issuance of senior notes requiring a cash payment of $59 million. This cash payment has been classified as a change in “Other liabilities” within “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.

•

Termination of interest rate swaps

— In April 2012, we elected to terminate our $1 billion interest rate swap portfolio associated with senior notes that were scheduled to mature from November 2012 through
March 2018. Upon termination of the swaps, we received $72 million in cash for their fair value. The cash proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in “Other assets” within
“Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

•

Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures

— Our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted in 2013 by changes in our working capital accounts.
Although our working capital changes may vary from year to year, they are typically driven by changes in accounts receivable, which are affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received, and accounts payable, which are affected by
both cost changes and timing of payments. Additionally, accruals for our annual incentive plan favorably affected our working capital comparison, driven by both higher incentive plan expense accruals in 2013 compared to 2012 and lower incentive plan
payments in 2013 as compared to 2012.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities

— The most
significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Capital expenditures —

We used $1,151 million during 2014 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,271 million in 2013 and $1,510 million in 2012. The decrease can generally be attributed to
increased focus on capital spending management. Capital expenditures in 2012 included increased spending on compressed natural gas vehicles, related fueling infrastructure, and information technology infrastructure and growth initiatives, as well as
our taking advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation.

•

Proceeds from divestitures —

Proceeds from divestitures and other assets (net of cash divested) were $2,253 million in 2014, $138
million in 2013 and $44 million in 2012. These divestitures were made as



part of our initiative to improve or divest certain non-strategic or underperforming operations. In 2014, our proceeds from divestitures were primarily related to the sale of our Wheelabrator
business for $1.95 billion and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. In 2013, our proceeds from
divestitures included approximately $41 million related to oil and gas producing properties and $14 million related to certain of our medical waste service operations and a transfer station in our Greater Mid-Atlantic Area. The remaining amount
reported for 2013, as well as the proceeds in 2012 generally relate to the sale of fixed assets.

•

Acquisitions

— Our spending on acquisitions was $35 million in 2014 compared with $724 million in 2013 and $250 million in 2012. All of our 2014 acquisitions related to our Solid Waste business. In
2013, our acquisitions consisted primarily of the recycling operations of Greenstar, for which we paid $170 million, and substantially all of the assets of RCI, for which we paid $481 million. The remainder of our 2013 acquisitions related to our
Solid Waste business and energy services operations. In 2012, our acquisitions consisted primarily of interests in oil and gas producing properties acquired through two transactions, for which we paid $94 million. See Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. We continue to focus on accretive acquisitions and growth opportunities that will enhance and expand our existing service offerings.

•

Investments in unconsolidated entities

— We made $33 million, $33 million and $77 million of cash investments in unconsolidated entities during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2014 and 2013, our
investments primarily related to additional capital contributions associated with our investment in a refined coal facility and waste diversion technology companies. In 2012, our investments primarily related to furthering our goal of expanding our
service offerings and developing waste diversion technologies.

•

Net receipts from restricted funds

— Net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, contributed $19
million to our investing activities in 2014 compared with $71 million in 2013 and $14 million in 2012. The significant increase in cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts during 2013 was due to an increase in tax-exempt
borrowings.

•

Other

— Net cash used by our other investing activities of $58 million, $81 million and $51 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was primarily associated with the funding of notes
receivable associated with Wheelabrator’s investments in the U.K., prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the
periods presented are summarized below:

•

Share repurchases —

For the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors.

During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with two financial institutions to
repurchase an aggregate of $600 million of our common stock. At the beginning of the ASR repurchase periods, we delivered the $600 million in cash and received 9.6 million shares, which represented 70% of the shares expected to be repurchased
based on then-current market prices. These agreements were completed in February 2015 and we received approximately 2.8 million additional shares. The final weighted average per share purchase price for the completed ASR agreements was $48.58.

We paid $239 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares of our common stock in 2013. We did not repurchase any shares during 2012.

We announced in February 2015 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1 billion in future share repurchases; this authorization is
the only currently outstanding authorization for share



repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend
declarations.

•

Dividend payments —

For the periods presented, all dividends have been declared and approved by our Board of Directors and paid in accordance with our financial plans.

We paid an aggregate of $693 million in cash dividends during 2014, compared with $683 million in 2013, and $658 million in 2012. The increase
in dividend payments is due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.355 in 2012, to $0.365 in 2013, and to $0.375 in 2014 and has been offset, in part, by a reduction in our common stock outstanding during 2013 and 2014 as a result of
our share repurchase programs.

In February 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from
$0.375 to $0.385 per share for dividends declared in 2015. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for
future business plans and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

•

Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options —

The exercise of common stock options and the related excess tax benefits generated a total of $93 million of financing cash inflows during 2014
compared with $132 million during 2013 and $43 million during 2012. The increase in exercised stock options during 2013 and, to a lesser extent, during 2014 is primarily due to the increase in the Company’s stock price combined with exercises
in advance of stock option expiration dates.

•

Debt borrowings (repayments) —

Net debt repayments were $751 million in 2014 compared to net debt borrowings of $155 million and $122 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The following summarizes
our cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each year (in millions):

During 2014 and 2012, we did not have any significant non-cash investing and financing activities. For the year
ended December 31, 2013, non-cash investing and financing activities included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal payments made directly from trust funds, of $99 million.

•

Acquisitions of and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests

— The purchases of and distributions paid to our noncontrolling
interests were $125 million, $59 million and $46 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase during 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to the purchase of the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs related to our
waste-to-energy facilities in December 2014



for $91 million, in anticipation of our sale of our Wheelabrator business. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment of our Wheelabrator business. See Note 20 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these LLCs.

(a)

Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2014 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our
landfills.

(b)

The amounts reported here represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt, excluding related interest. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding interest
rates.

(c)

Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2014 include $638 million of tax-exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re-offerings of the bonds
are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. We have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowing for purposes of this disclosure. For
additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(d)

Our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not
result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods.

(e)

Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note
11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

(f)

Our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of our obligations are quantity driven. For contracts that require
us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are not necessarily
indicative of our actual cash flow obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations.



Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items

Bonus Depreciation

— The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law on December 19, 2014 and included an
extension for one year of the bonus depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2015 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2014 qualifying
capital expenditures resulting from the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2014 although it will reduce our cash taxes by approximately $60 million.

Taking accelerated deductions results in increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital expenditures
would have otherwise been taken. Overall, the effect of all applicable years’ bonus depreciation programs resulted in increased cash taxes of $30 million in 2014. Separately, our tax payments in 2014 were $247 million higher than the tax
payments made in 2013 primarily due to (i) higher pre-tax earnings, (ii) an anticipated overpayment of taxes, and (iii) divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets.

Uncertain Tax Positions

— We have liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities
are included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the Company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are not
able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. We anticipate that approximately $12
million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and $3 million of related tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals primarily relate to state tax items, none of which are
material, and are expected to result from audit settlements or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

We have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the

Guarantees

section of Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements have not materially
affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2014, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

New Accou

nting Standard Pending Adoption

In May 2014, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires companies to recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the amendments will require
enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The amended guidance may be applied
retrospectively for all periods presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial application. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of the amended
guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Inflation

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of diesel fuel, have affected our income from operations margins in recent years, we
believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not



expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term
agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. Additionally, management’s estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and
environmental remediation liabilities.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

In the normal course of
business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with
independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount. As of December 31, 2014, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of
non-performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties.

Interest Rate Exposure

— Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities,
although our interest costs can also be significantly affected by our on-going financial assurance needs, which are discussed in the

Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations

section of Item 1.

As of December 31, 2014, we had $9.4 billion of long-term debt when excluding the impacts of accounting for fair value adjustments
attributable to interest rate derivatives, discounts and premiums. The effective interest rates of approximately $1.4 billion of our outstanding debt obligations are subject to change during 2015. The most significant components of our variable-rate
debt obligations are (i) $501 million of tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process; (ii) $638 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject
to repricing within 12 months and (iii) $232 million of outstanding advances under our Canadian credit facility. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would
increase our 2015 interest expense by approximately $11.2 million. As of December 31, 2013, the effective interest rates of approximately $2.4 billion of our outstanding debt obligations were subject to change within 12 months.

Our remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our
“fixed-rate” tax exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds twelve months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations and various interest rate derivative instruments, if any, can increase or decrease
significantly if market interest rates change.

We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect
the fair value of our market risk-sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our
assumptions. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate derivative
positions by approximately $650 million at December 31, 2014.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have
significant cash and cash equivalent balances as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government
obligations with original maturities of three months or less. Because of the short terms to maturity of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

Commodity Price Exposure

— In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market
risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally



correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. During the three years ended December 31, 2014, we generally have not entered into derivatives to hedge the
risks associated with changes in the market prices of these commodities, with the exception of electricity commodity derivatives divested in conjunction with the sale of our Wheelabrator business in December 2014. Alternatively, we attempt to manage
these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues also increase or
decrease.

Currency Rate Exposure

— We have operations in Canada as well as a cost center in India and investments in Hong
Kong. From time to time, we use currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows of intercompany Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign currency derivatives have not materially affected our
financial position or results of operations for the periods presented. In addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives, we believe these changes in fair
value would not have a material impact to the Company. The foreign currency exposure associated with these investments has not been material. Refer to Notes 8 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our
foreign currency derivatives.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the principal executive and financial officers, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial
reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and procedures that:

i.

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

ii.

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

iii.

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on
the Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2014.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report, which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Waste Management, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 17, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Waste Management, Inc. at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

1. Business

The financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware
corporation; Waste Management’s wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which Waste Management or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries as described in Note 20. Waste Management is a
holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. When the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When we use the term “WM,” we are referring only to Waste Management, Inc., the parent holding company.

We are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services. We partner with our residential,
commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. Our “Solid Waste”
business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provides collection, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, and disposal services. Through our subsidiaries, we are also a leading
developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the United States. In December 2014, we completed the previously announced sale of our Wheelabrator business, which provided waste-to-energy services and managed waste-to-energy
facilities and independent power production plants. Refer to Note 19 for additional information related to our divestitures.

We evaluate,
oversee and manage the financial performance of our Solid Waste business subsidiaries through our 17 geographic Areas. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, which are presented in this report as
“Other.” Additional information related to our segments can be found in Note 21.

2. Accounting Changes and Reclassifications

Accounting Changes

Comprehensive Income

— In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amended authoritative
guidance associated with comprehensive income, which requires companies to provide information about the amounts that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Additionally, companies are required to present
significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. The amendment to authoritative guidance associated with comprehensive income was effective for the Company on January 1,
2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We have presented the information required by this amendment in Note 14.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing

— In July 2012, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with
indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing. The amended guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more
likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the
entity is not required to take further action. The amendments are effective for indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012; however, early adoption was permitted. The
Company’s early adoption of this guidance in 2012 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additional information on impairment testing can be found in Note 3.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reclassifications

When necessary, reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financial information in order to conform to the current year
presentation.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of WM, its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest
are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.

Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition
and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or
simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that
present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. Each of these items
is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less
at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments
held within our trust funds and escrow accounts, accounts receivable and derivative instruments. We make efforts to control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other financial interests
with a diverse group of credit-worthy financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit
evaluations, credit limits and monitoring procedures, although generally we do not have collateral requirements for credit extensions. We also control our exposure associated with trade receivables by discontinuing service, to the extent allowable,
to non-paying customers. However, our overall credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large number of diverse customers we serve. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, no single customer represented greater than 5% of total
accounts receivable.

Trade and Other Receivables

Our receivables, which are recorded when billed, when services are performed or when cash is advanced, are claims against third parties that
will generally be settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends; type of customer, such
as municipal or commercial; the age of outstanding receivables; and existing economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is given to the collectability
of those balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful. Also, we recognize interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable
as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes. We no longer accrue interest once the notes are deemed uncollectible.

Other
receivables at December 31, 2014 and 2013 include receivables related to tax payments in excess of the provision of $255 million and $23 million, respectively.

Parts and Supplies

Parts and supplies consist primarily of spare parts, fuel, tires, lubricants and processed recycling materials. Our parts and supplies are
stated at the lower of cost, using the average cost method, or market.

Landfill Accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept waste. These costs
generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property); permitting; excavation; liner material and installation; landfill leachate collection systems; landfill gas collection systems;
environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas; and directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes asset
retirement costs, which represent estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These costs are discussed below.

Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

— Following is a description of our asset retirement activities and our related
accounting:

•

Final Capping

— Involves the installation of flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace
capacity has been consumed. Final capping asset retirement obligations are recorded on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific final capping event with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Each final
capping event is accounted for as a discrete obligation and recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated with each final capping event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required), demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs incurred after the site ceases
to accept waste, but before the landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state regulatory agency. These costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase
in the landfill asset. Closure obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing closure activities.

•

Post-Closure

— Involves the maintenance and monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to maintain and monitor
landfill sites for a 30-year period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Post-closure
obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing post-closure activities.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel,
engineers and accountants. Our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value. Absent quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value is based on the best
available information, including the results of present value techniques. In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use historical experience, professional engineering
judgment and quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract with third parties or perform the work
ourselves. In those instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component of operating income when the work is performed.

Once we have determined the final capping, closure and post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount
those expected future costs back to present value. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we inflated these costs in current dollars until the expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 2.5%. We discounted these costs
to present value using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred, consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated cash flows
are treated as a new liability and discounted at the current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the historical weighted-average rate of the recorded obligation. As a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to calculate
the present value of an obligation is specific to each individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted-average rate applicable to our asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2014 is between 4.00% and 7.75%. We expect to apply a
credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate of 4.00% to liabilities incurred in the first quarter of 2015.

We record the estimated fair
value of final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity consumed through the current period. The fair value of final capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to
date for each final capping event and the expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire landfill and the
expected timing of each closure and post-closure activity. Because these obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure and post-closure
activities could result in a material change in these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or extent of future final capping, closure and post-closure activities
typically result in both (i) a current adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset and (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over either the remaining capacity of the related discrete final
capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace (as defined below) of the landfill. Any changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our amortization policy, which
would generally result in amortization expense being recognized prospectively over the remaining capacity of the final capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as appropriate. Changes in such estimates
associated with airspace that has been fully utilized result in an adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill assets with an immediate corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace amortization expense.

Interest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and is recorded as
final capping, closure and post-closure expense, which is included in “Operating” costs and expenses within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The amortizable basis of a landfill includes
(i) amounts previously expended and capitalized; (ii) capitalized landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs; (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs required to develop the landfill site to its
remaining permitted and expansion capacity and (iv) projected asset retirement costs related to landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities.

Amortization is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying expense as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each
component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do not own, but operate through operating or lease arrangements, the rate per ton is calculated
based on expected capacity to be utilized over the lesser of the contractual term of the underlying agreement or the life of the landfill.

We apply the following guidelines in determining a landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:

•

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The
remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace
associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe that obtaining the
expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and

•

Financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must
meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy
provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and
circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 23 landfill sites with expansions included at December 31, 2014, five landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Two of these landfills required
approval by our Chief Financial Officer because of community or political opposition that could impede the



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expansion process. The remaining three landfills required approval due to local zoning restrictions or because the permit application processes do not meet the one- or five-year requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected
costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is
established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement
that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated
access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate, and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group, and the AUF used is
reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its
highest point under the permit requirements.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our
landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets
associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts
change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure
activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be
significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that
expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time management makes the
decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may
have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations, settlements, and
certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a
number of estimates and assumptions.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to
remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste
hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our
internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation is inherently difficult. We recognize and accrue for an estimated remediation
liability when we determine that such liability is both probable and reasonably estimable. Determining the method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number of assumptions be made. There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates
of the costs associated with the likely site remediation alternatives identified in the investigation of the extent of environmental impact. In these cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If no amount within a
range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately $190 million higher than the $235 million
recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2014. Our ultimate responsibility may differ materially from current estimates. It is possible that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of
environmental studies, the inability to identify other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require us to record additional liabilities. Our ongoing review of our remediation
liabilities, in light of relevant internal and external facts and circumstances, could result in revisions to our accruals that could cause upward or downward adjustments to income from operations. These adjustments could be material in any given
period.

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and the timing of the payments are
fixed or reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in current dollars (by 2.5% at December 31, 2014 and 2013) until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value using a risk-free discount rate, which is based on the rate
for U.S. Treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted average period until settlement of the underlying obligation. We determine the risk-free discount rate and the inflation rate on an annual basis unless interim changes would
significantly impact our results of operations. For remedial liabilities that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based on the effective interest method, in “Operating” costs and expenses in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The following table summarizes the impacts of revisions in the risk-free discount rate applied to our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets during the reported periods (in millions) and the risk-free discount rate
applied as of each reporting date:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The portion of our recorded environmental remediation liabilities that has never been subject
to inflation or discounting, as the amounts and timing of payments are not fixed or reliably determinable, was $41 million at December 31, 2014 and $36 million at December 31, 2013. Had we not inflated and discounted any portion of our
environmental remediation liability, the amount recorded would have decreased by $6 million at December 31, 2014 and increased by $7 million at December 31, 2013.

Property and Equipment (exclusive of landfills, discussed above)

We record property and equipment at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and maintenance activities are
expensed as incurred. We depreciate property and equipment over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for our depreciable property and equipment. When property and equipment are retired,
sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations as an offset or increase to operating expense for the period.

The estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows (in years):

Useful Lives

Vehicles — excluding rail haul cars

3 to 10

Vehicles — rail haul cars

10 to 20

Machinery and equipment — including containers

3 to 30

Buildings and improvements — excluding waste-to-energy facilities

5 to 40

Waste-to-energy facilities and related equipment

up to 50

Furniture, fixtures and office equipment

3 to 10

We include capitalized costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software within furniture,
fixtures and office equipment. These costs include direct external costs of materials and services used in developing or obtaining the software and internal costs for employees directly associated with the software development project. As of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, capitalized costs for software placed in service, net of accumulated depreciation, were $114 million and $129 million, respectively. In addition, our furniture, fixtures and office equipment as of December 31,
2014 and 2013 included $5 million and $11 million, respectively, for costs incurred for software under development.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our business. Our most significant lease obligations are for property
and equipment specific to our industry, including real property operated as a landfill or transfer station. Our leases have varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations
that we consider in determining minimum lease payments. The leases are classified as either operating leases or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating Leases (excluding landfills discussed below)

— The majority of our leases are operating leases. This classification
generally can be attributed to either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease payments as a result of real property lease obligations that vary based on the volume of waste we receive or process or (ii) minimum lease terms that are much
shorter than the assets’ economic useful lives. Management expects that in the normal course of business our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by other leases, or replaced with fixed asset expenditures. Our rent expense during each of
the last three years and our future minimum operating lease payments for each of the next five years for which we are contractually obligated as of December 31, 2014 are disclosed in Note 11.

Capital Leases

(

excluding landfills discussed below)

— Assets under
capital leases are capitalized using interest rates determined at the inception of each lease and are amortized over either the useful life of the asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a straight-line basis. The present value of the related
lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation. Our future minimum annual capital lease payments are included in our total future debt obligations as disclosed in Note 7.

Landfill Leases

— From an operating perspective, landfills that we lease are similar to landfills we own because generally we own
the landfill’s operating permit and will operate the landfill for the entire lease term, which in many cases is the life of the landfill. As a result, our landfill leases are generally capital leases. The most significant portion of our rental
obligations for landfill leases is contingent upon operating factors such as disposal volumes and often there are no contractual minimum rental obligations. Contingent rental obligations are expensed as incurred. For landfill capital leases that
provide for minimum contractual rental obligations, we record the present value of the minimum obligation as part of the landfill asset, which is amortized on a units-of-consumption basis over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the
landfill.

Acquisitions

We generally recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, based on
fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition.

Contingent Consideration —

In certain acquisitions, we agree to pay
additional amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue levels, targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for expanded landfill airspace. We have
recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition with any differences between the acquisition-date fair value and the ultimate settlement of the obligations being recognized as an
adjustment to income from operations.

Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities —

Assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies such as pre-acquisition environmental matters and litigation are recognized at their acquisition-date fair value when their respective fair values can be determined. If the fair values of such contingencies cannot be determined, they
are recognized at the acquisition date if the contingencies are probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated.

Acquisition-date fair
value estimates are revised as necessary and accounted for as an adjustment to income from operations if, and when, additional information regarding these contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. All acquisition-related transaction costs have been expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize
goodwill, but as discussed in the

Asset Impairments

section below, we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually.

Other
intangible assets consist primarily of customer and supplier relationships, covenants not-to-compete, licenses, permits (other than landfill permits, as all landfill-related intangible assets are combined with landfill tangible assets and amortized
using our landfill amortization policy), and other contracts. Other intangible assets are recorded at acquisition date fair value and are generally amortized using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis as we determine
appropriate. Customer and supplier relationships are typically



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortized over a term ranging between 10 and 15 years. Covenants not-to-compete are amortized over the term of the non-compete covenant, which is generally two to five years. Licenses, permits
and other contracts are amortized over the definitive terms of the related agreements. If the underlying agreement does not contain definitive terms and the useful life is determined to be indefinite, the asset is not amortized.

Asset Impairments

We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets
using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining
to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash
flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of
undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected
cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less
than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in the “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments
(other than goodwill) and unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our
ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.

There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills,
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, as described below.

Landfills

— The assessment of impairment
indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the
sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste
from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the
waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of
recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. At December 31, 2014, one of our landfill sites for which we believe receipt of the
expansion permit is probable, is not currently accepting waste. The net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost for this site was $247 million at December 31, 2014. We performed a test of recoverability for this landfill and the undiscounted
cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach significantly exceeded the carrying value of this site. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills,
primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern
Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis,



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI Environnement, Inc. (“RCI”), we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be avoided as we are able to
allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the carrying values of landfill assets were no longer able to be
recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote their carrying values down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets.

Refer to Note 13 for additional information related to landfill asset impairments recognized during the reported periods.

Goodwill

— At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess our goodwill for impairment using Level 3 inputs.

We assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our qualitative assessment involves
determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment.

If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. The first step in our quantitative assessment
identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second
step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Fair value is typically estimated using a combination of the income approach and market approach or only an income approach when applicable. The income approach is based on the long-term
projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent
in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our
business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported cash flows. We then apply that multiple to the
reporting units’ cash flows to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to
our reporting units.

Fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future
operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we
believe that these two methods provide a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our reporting units.

Refer to Notes 6 and 13
for additional information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Other Than Goodwill

— At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

When performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally
first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe an impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of
assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value.

Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows. We
discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is
appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business.

Fair value computed by this method is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, economic
projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. However, we believe that this method
provides a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts

As of both December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our restricted trust and escrow accounts consist principally of
funds deposited for purposes of settling landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. We often also have restricted trust and escrow account balances related to funds received from the issuance of
tax-exempt bonds held in trust for the construction of various projects or facilities. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $171 million and $167 million, respectively, of restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are primarily included
in “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Final Capping, Closure, Post-Closure and Environmental Remediation
Funds

— At several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations.
Balances maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements; (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of funds for
qualifying final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities; (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills and (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments held in the trust fund or escrow
accounts.

Tax-Exempt Bond Funds

— We obtain funds from the issuance of industrial revenue bonds for the construction of
disposal facilities and for equipment necessary to provide waste management services. Proceeds from these arrangements are directly deposited into trust accounts, and we do not have the ability to use the funds in regular operating activities.
Accordingly, these borrowings are treated as non-cash financing activities and are excluded from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As our construction and equipment expenditures are documented and approved by the applicable bond trustee,
the funds are released and we receive a cash reimbursement. These cash reimbursements are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust funds. Generally, the funds are fully
expended within one year of the debt issuance. When the debt matures, we generally repay our obligation with cash on hand and the debt repayments are included as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Investments in unconsolidated entities over which the Company has significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Investments in entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees’ operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. In addition to
equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, we support these ventures through loans and advances. These loans and advances are included as a component of “Other” within the “Net cash provided by investing activities” in
our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes our equity and cost method investments as of December 31 (in millions):

(a)

The amount reported in 2013 included $177 million attributable to our 2010 investment in Shanghai Environment Group (“SEG”), which was part of our Wheelabrator business. This investment was classified as a
current asset and reflected in “Investment in unconsolidated entity” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013, based on our intent to sell our investment in SEG within the next 12 months. We sold our investment in SEG
in the first quarter of 2014.

We monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential
impairment and write them down to their fair value when other-than-temporary declines exist. Fair value is generally based on (i) other third-party investors’ recent transactions in the securities; (ii) other information
available regarding the current market for similar assets and/or (iii) a market or income approach as deemed appropriate.

Foreign Currency

We have operations in Canada as well as a cost center in India. Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies of our
operations and investments outside the United States. The assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using
the average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation difference is reflected as a component of comprehensive income.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates. In prior years, we used interest rate swaps to maintain a strategic portion of our long-term debt obligations at variable, market-driven interest rates or in anticipation of planned senior note issuances to effectively lock in a
fixed interest rate for those anticipated issuances. Foreign currency exchange rate derivatives are used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates for anticipated intercompany debt transactions, and related interest payments, between Waste
Management Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary (“WM Holdings”), and its Canadian subsidiaries. Prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business, we used electricity commodity derivatives to mitigate the variability in our revenues and
cash flows caused by fluctuations in the market prices for electricity. The financial statement impacts of our derivatives are discussed in Notes 8 and 14.

We obtain current valuations of our interest rate and foreign currency hedging instruments from third-party pricing models. The estimated fair
values of derivatives used to hedge risks fluctuate over time and should be



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

viewed in relation to the underlying hedged transaction and the overall management of our exposure to fluctuations in the underlying risks. The fair value of derivatives is included in other
current assets, other long-term assets, current accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. Any ineffectiveness present in either fair value or cash flow hedges is recognized immediately in earnings without offset. There was
no significant ineffectiveness in 2014, 2013 or 2012.

•

Foreign Currency Derivatives

— Our foreign currency derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, which results in the unrealized changes in the fair value of the
derivative instruments being recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” within the equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated balance in other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings as the hedged
cash flows affect earnings. In each of the periods presented, these derivatives have effectively mitigated the impacts of the hedged transactions, resulting in immaterial impacts to our results of operations for the periods presented.

•

Interest Rate Derivatives

— Our previously outstanding “receive fixed, pay variable” interest rate swaps associated with outstanding fixed-rate senior notes had been designated as fair value
hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, derivative assets were accounted for as an increase in the carrying value of our underlying debt obligations and derivative liabilities were accounted for as a decrease in the carrying value of our
underlying debt instruments. These fair value adjustments are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged instruments. Treasury locks and forward-starting swaps executed in prior years were
designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The fair value of these derivative instruments were recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” within the equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated
balance in other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings as the hedged cash flows occur.

Insured and
Self-Insured Claims

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general
liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by factoring in
pending claims and historical trends and data. The gross estimated liability associated with settling unpaid claims is included in “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets if expected to be settled within one year, or
otherwise is included in long-term “Other liabilities.” Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are reflected as current “Other receivables” or long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste collection, transfer, disposal and recycling and resource recovery services; from
the sale of electricity and landfill gas, which are byproducts of our landfill operations; and from the sale of recyclable commodities, oil and gas and organic lawn and garden products. The fees charged for our services are generally defined in our
service agreements and vary based on contract-specific terms such as frequency of service, weight, volume and the general market factors influencing a region’s rates. The fees we charge for our services generally include fuel surcharges, which
are intended to pass through to customers increased direct and indirect costs incurred because of changes in market prices for fuel. We generally recognize revenue as services are performed or products are delivered. For example, revenue typically
is recognized as waste is collected, tons are received at our landfills or transfer stations, recycling commodities are delivered or as kilowatts are delivered to a customer by a waste-to-energy facility or independent power production plant.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Tangible product revenues primarily include the sale of recyclable commodities at our
material recovery facilities and through our recycling brokerage services and, to a lesser extent, sales of oil and gas, metals and organic lawn and garden products.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services include, among others, certain residential contracts that are billed on a
quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as revenue in the period service is provided.

Capitalized Interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development, including internal-use software and landfill expansion projects, and on certain
assets under construction, including operating landfills and landfill gas-to-energy projects. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, total interest costs were $487 million, $500 million and $509 million, respectively, of which $16 million was capitalized in
2014, $19 million was capitalized in 2013 and $21 million was capitalized in 2012. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, interest was capitalized primarily for landfill construction costs.

Income Taxes

The
Company is subject to income tax in the United States and Canada. Current tax obligations associated with our provision for income taxes are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of “Accrued liabilities”
and the deferred tax obligations are reflected in “Deferred income taxes.”

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference
between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions
and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we
believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.

To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued
and are classified as a component of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Contingent Liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). We are party to pending or threatened legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters in various jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict the outcome of litigation, as it is
subject to many uncertainties. Additionally, it is not always possible for management to make a meaningful estimate of the potential loss or range of loss associated with such contingencies.

(a)

The amounts reported for our landfill liabilities include a reduction of approximately $20 million for 2013 and an increase of approximately $2

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately $23 million due to the acceleration of the timing of closure and post-closure activities at two of our landfills related to landfill asset impairments, discussed further in Note 13.

(b)

The amount reported in 2013 for our environmental remediation liabilities includes the impact of an increase in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our liabilities from 1.75% at December 31, 2012 to 3.0% at
December 31, 2013, resulting in a decrease of $18 million to our environmental remediation liabilities and a corresponding decrease to “Operating” expenses.

The amount reported in 2014 for environmental remediation liabilities includes the impact of a decrease in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our liabilities from 3.0% at December 31, 2013 to 2.0% at
December 31, 2014, resulting in an increase of $13 million to our environmental remediation liabilities and a corresponding increase to “Operating” expenses.

(c)

The amounts reported for our 2014 landfill liabilities include reductions of approximately $25 million for divestitures, including the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business.

Our recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2014 include the impacts of inflating certain of these costs based on our expectations for
the timing of cash settlement and of discounting certain of these costs to present value. Anticipated payments of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as measured in current dollars are $43 million in 2015, $26 million in 2016,
$26 million in 2017, $24 million in 2018, $12 million in 2019 and $98 million thereafter.

At several of our landfills, we provide
financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. Generally, these trust funds are established to comply
with statutory requirements and operating agreements. See Note 20 for additional information related to these trusts.

6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill was $5,740 million as of December 31, 2014 compared with $6,070 million as of December 31, 2013. The $330
million decrease in goodwill during 2014 is primarily related to the sale of our Wheelabrator business and, to a lesser extent, the effect of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the goodwill associated with our Canadian operations
and goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations. See Notes 3, 13, 19 and 21 for additional information.

As
discussed more fully in Note 3, we perform our annual impairment test of our goodwill balances using a measurement date of October 1. We will also perform interim tests if an impairment indicator exists such that the fair value of a reporting
unit could potentially be less than its carrying amount. We did not encounter any events or changes in circumstances that indicated that an impairment was more likely than not during interim periods in 2014, 2013 or 2012.

During our annual 2013 impairment test of our goodwill balances we determined the fair value of our Wheelabrator business had declined and the
associated goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $483 million, which had no related tax benefit. We estimated the implied fair value of our Wheelabrator reporting unit goodwill using a combination of income and
market approaches. Because the annual impairment test indicated that Wheelabrator’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, we performed the “step two” analysis. In the “step two” analysis, the fair values of all
assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, power contracts, customer relationships and trade name for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was then
compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. The factors contributing to the $483 million goodwill impairment charge principally related to the continued challenging business environment in areas of the
country in which Wheelabrator operated, characterized by lower available disposal volumes (which impact disposal rates and overall disposal revenue, as well as the amount of electricity Wheelabrator was able to generate), lower electricity pricing
due to the pricing pressure created by availability of natural gas and increased operating costs as Wheelabrator’s facilities aged. These factors caused us to lower prior assumptions for electricity and disposal revenue, and increase assumed
operating costs. Additionally, the discount factor previously utilized in the income approach in 2013 increased mainly due to increases in interest rates. In 2013, we incurred an additional $10 million of charges to impair goodwill associated with
our Puerto Rico operations and $4 million to impair goodwill associated with our recycling business.

Amortization expense for other intangible assets was $78 million for 2014, $80 million for 2013 and $69
million for 2012. At December 31, 2014, we had $19 million of licenses, permits and other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, because they do not have stated expirations or have routine, administrative renewal processes.
Additional information related to other intangible assets acquired through business combinations is included in Note 19. As of December 31, 2014, expected annual amortization expense related to other intangible assets is $69 million in 2015;
$62 million in 2016; $55 million in 2017; $50 million in 2018 and $43 million in 2019.

Debt Classification

As of December 31, 2014, our current debt balances include (i) $947 million of senior notes repaid with available cash in January
2015 that the Company decided to redeem in advance of their scheduled maturities, including $350 million of 6.375% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2015, $147 million of 7.125% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in
December 2017 and $450 million of 7.375% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2019 and (ii) $143 million of debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $64 million of tax-exempt bonds.

As of December 31, 2014, we also have $638 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within 12 months and
an additional $501 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit. The interest rates on these bonds are reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. All recent remarketings have
successfully placed Company bonds with investors at reasonable, market-driven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be a success. However, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the
bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we have the intent and ability to use availability under our long-term U.S. revolving credit facility (“$2.25 billion revolving credit facility”) to fund the debt obligation until it can
be remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we classified these borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014.

Access to and Utilization of Credit Facilities

$2.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility

— In July 2013, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, increasing our total
credit capacity to $2.25 billion and extending the term through July 2018. This facility provides us with credit capacity to be used for either cash borrowings or to support letters of credit. The rates we pay for outstanding loans are generally
based on LIBOR plus a spread depending on the Company’s debt rating assigned by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. The spread above LIBOR ranges from 0.90% to 1.475%. At December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding
borrowings and $785 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving unused and available credit capacity of $1,465 million.

Letter of Credit Facilities

— As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate committed capacity of $400 million under letter of
credit facilities with terms ending through December 2018. This letter of credit capacity was fully utilized as of December 31, 2014. The financial assurance needs of our business are extensive so we supplement the letter of credit capacity we
have through these committed facilities with stand-alone letters of credit with various banking partners.

Canadian Credit Facility and
Term Loan

— Waste Management of Canada Corporation and WM Quebec Inc., wholly-owned subsidiaries of WM, are borrowers under a Canadian credit agreement that provides C$150 million of revolving credit capacity and initially provided C$500
million of term credit. The credit agreement matures in November 2017. WM and WM Holdings guaranty all subsidiary obligations outstanding under the credit agreement. The rates we pay for outstanding loans under the Canadian credit agreement are
generally based on the applicable Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (CDOR) plus a spread depending on the Company’s debt rating assigned by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. The spread above CDOR ranges from 1.125% to
2.15%.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we established the C$150 million revolving credit capacity to refinance borrowings outstanding
under a Canadian term credit agreement that would have matured in November 2012 and to provide additional liquidity for our Canadian operations. We have the ability to issue up to C$50 million of letters of credit under the Canadian revolving
credit facility, which if utilized, reduces the amount of credit capacity available for borrowings. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no letters of credit outstanding



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under the facility. We had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2014 and C$10 million of outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2013.

The C$500 million of term credit was established specifically to fund the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of RCI and was
fully drawn in July 2013. The term credit is non-revolving credit and principal amounts repaid may not be re-borrowed. Through December 31, 2014, we had repaid C$230 million of the term credit with available cash, reducing the outstanding
and drawn credit to C$270 million. For additional information related to borrowings and principal repayments under the term credit, see below.

Debt Borrowings and Repayments

Canadian Credit Facility and Term Loan

— Our outstanding CDOR-based advances, which are generally indexed to one-month CDOR, mature
in November 2017, but are prepayable without penalty. Accordingly, this debt has been classified as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We repaid C$170 million, or $155 million, of the advances under our Canadian credit agreement during the
year ended December 31, 2014 with available cash. The remaining change in the carrying value of our Canadian credit facility and term loan is due to changes in the Canadian currency translation rate.

Senior Notes

— In March 2014, we repaid $350 million of 5.0% senior notes upon maturity with borrowings under our $2.25 billion
revolving credit facility. In May 2014, we issued $350 million of 3.5% senior notes due May 15, 2024. The net proceeds from the debt issuance were $347 million, all of which were used to repay borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit
facility. The change in the carrying value of our senior notes from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 is principally due to fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts. Refer to Notes 8 and 14 for additional
information regarding our interest rate derivatives.

Tax-Exempt Bonds

— During the year ended December 31, 2014, we
repaid $123 million of our tax-exempt bonds with available cash.

Scheduled Debt Payments

— Principal payments of our debt and
capital leases for the next five years, based on scheduled maturities as adjusted for the Company’s optional early redemption of certain of its senior notes, are as follows: $1,075 million in 2015; $717 million in 2016; $402 million in 2017;
$801 million in 2018; and $132 million in 2019. Our recorded debt and capital lease obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities, which have been
excluded from these amounts because they will not result in cash payments.

Secured Debt

Our debt balances are generally unsecured, except for capital leases and the note payable associated with our investment in low-income housing
properties.

Debt Covenants

Our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, our Canadian credit agreement and certain other financing agreements contain financial covenants.
The following table summarizes the most restrictive requirements of these financial covenants (all terms used to measure these ratios are defined by the facilities):

Interest coverage ratio

> 2.75 to 1

Total debt to EBITDA(a)

< 3.75 to 1



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(a)

In conjunction with the amendment and restatement of our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility in July 2013, the maximum ratio was increased from 3.50:1 to 3.75:1 for quarters ending before September 30, 2015.
After such time, the covenant ratio will revert back to 3.50:1 for each fiscal quarter through maturity of the facility in July 2018.

Our credit facilities and senior notes also contain certain restrictions intended to monitor our level of subsidiary indebtedness, types of
investments and net worth. We monitor our compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or financing arrangements typical for our business. As of December 31, 2014 and
2013, we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions under all of our debt agreements that may have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have not offset fair value amounts recognized for our derivative instruments. For information related to the inputs used to measure our
derivative assets and liabilities at fair value, refer to Note 18.

Fair Value Hedges

Interest Rate Swaps

In
prior years, we entered into interest rate swaps to maintain a portion of our debt obligations at variable market interest rates. We designated these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate senior notes. Fair value hedge
accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of our debt instruments by $45 million as of December 31, 2014 and $59 million as of December 31, 2013. These fair value adjustments to long-term debt are being
amortized as a reduction to interest expense using the effective interest method over the remaining term of the related senior notes, which extend through 2028.

Gains or losses on the derivatives as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged items attributable to our interest rate swaps are
recognized in current earnings. We include gains and losses on our interest rate swaps as adjustments to interest expense, which is the same financial statement line item where offsetting gains and losses on the related hedged items are recorded.
The fair value adjustment from active interest rate swaps and the offsetting gain on the related hedged items was immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2012. We did not have any active swaps outstanding in 2014 and 2013.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We also recognize the impacts of (i) net periodic settlements of current interest on our
active interest rate swaps, if any, and (ii) the amortization of previously terminated interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense. The following table summarizes these impacts on our results of operations (in millions):

Cash Flow Hedges

Forward-Starting Interest Rate Swaps

In prior years, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $525 million to hedge the risk of changes
in semi-annual interest payments due to fluctuations in the forward ten-year LIBOR swap rate for anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances in 2011, 2012 and 2014. We designated these forward-starting interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.

The active forward-starting interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2013 related to a debt issuance initially forecasted for
March 2014, that occurred in May 2014. As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of these active interest rate derivatives of $28 million was included in current liabilities. During the first quarter of 2014, these forward-starting interest rate
swaps with a notional value of $175 million matured and we paid cash of $36 million to settle the associated liabilities.

At
December 31, 2014 and 2013, our “Accumulated other comprehensive income” included $50 million and $34 million, respectively, of after-tax deferred losses related to all terminated forward-starting interest rate swaps. These losses are
being amortized as an increase to interest expense using the effective interest method over the ten-year term of the related senior notes, which extend through 2024. As of December 31, 2014, $11 million (on a pre-tax basis) is scheduled to be
reclassified as an increase to interest expense over the next 12 months.

Foreign Currency Derivatives

We use foreign currency exchange rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates for anticipated intercompany cash
transactions between WM Holdings and its Canadian subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had foreign exchange cross currency swaps outstanding for all of the anticipated cash flows associated with intercompany loans from WM Holdings
to the wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries. The hedged cash flows as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 included C$370 million of total notional value. The scheduled principal payments of the loan and the related swaps are as follows: C$70 million
due on October 31, 2016, C$150 million due on October 31, 2017 and C$150 million due on October 31, 2018. We designated these cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement of the underlying
non-functional currency intercompany loans are recognized in current earnings in the same financial statement line item as offsetting gains or losses on the related cross currency swaps.

There was no significant ineffectiveness associated with our cash flow hedges during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
Refer to Note 14 for information regarding the impacts of our cash flow derivatives on our comprehensive income and results of operations.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Our interest rate derivative instruments have in the past, and may in the future, contain provisions related to the Company’s credit
rating. These provisions generally provide that if the Company’s credit rating were to fall to specified levels below investment grade, the counterparties have the ability to terminate the derivative agreements, resulting in settlement of all
affected transactions. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding that contained these credit-risk-related features.

Tax Implications of Divestitures

— During 2014, the Company recorded a net gain of $515 million
primarily related to the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, our Puerto Rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have
increased by $138 million. See Note 19 for more information related to divestitures.

Investment in Refined Coal Facility

— In
2011, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company, which was established to invest in and manage a refined coal facility in North Dakota. The facility’s refinement processes qualify for federal tax credits that are
expected to be realized through 2019 in accordance with Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code.

We account for our investment in
this entity using the equity method of accounting, recognizing our share of the entity’s results of operations and other reductions in the value of our investment in “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities,” within our
Consolidated Statement of Operations. We recognized $7 million, $8 million and $7 million of net losses resulting from our share of the entity’s operating losses during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our
tax provision was reduced by $21 million, $20 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily as a result of tax credits realized from this investment. See Note 20 for additional information
related to this investment.

Investment in Low-Income Housing Properties

— In 2010, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a
limited liability company established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. The entity’s low-income housing investments qualify for federal tax credits that are expected to be realized through 2020 in accordance with
Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.

We account for our investment in this entity using the equity method of accounting
recognizing our share of the entity’s results of operations and other reductions in the value of our investment in “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities,” within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The value of our
investment decreases as the tax credits are generated and utilized. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $25 million, $25 million and $24 million, respectively, of losses relating to our equity investment in
this entity, $5 million, $6 million and $7 million, respectively, of interest expense, and a reduction in our tax provision of $37 million (including $25 million of tax credits), $38 million (including $26 million of tax credits) and $38 million
(including $26 million of tax credits), respectively. See Note 20 for additional information related to this investment.

Adjustments
to Accruals and Related Deferred Taxes

— Adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes due to the filing of our income tax returns and changes in state law resulted in a reduction of $24 million and increases of $4 million and $7
million to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Tax Audit
Settlements

— We file income tax returns in the United States and Canada as well as various state and local jurisdictions. We are currently under audit by the IRS, Canada Revenue Agency and various state and local taxing authorities. Our
audits are in various stages of completion.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2014, 2013 and 2012 we settled various tax audits. The settlement of these tax
audits resulted in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $12 million, $11 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

We participate in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process, which means we work with the IRS throughout the year in order to resolve any
material issues prior to the filing of our annual tax return. We are currently in the examination phase of IRS audits for the tax years 2013, 2014 and 2015 and expect these audits to be completed within the next three, 15 and 27 months,
respectively. We are also currently undergoing audits by various state and local jurisdictions for tax years that date back to 2009, with the exception of affirmative claims in a limited number of jurisdictions that date back to 2000. We are also
under audit in Canada for the tax years 2012 and 2013. In 2011, we acquired Oakleaf Global Holdings (“Oakleaf”), which is subject to potential IRS examination for the year 2011. Pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of Oakleaf, we are
entitled to indemnification for Oakleaf’s pre-acquisition period tax liabilities.

State Net Operating Loss and Credit
Carry-Forwards

— During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized state net operating loss and credit carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $16 million, $16 million and $5 million, respectively.

Federal Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards

— During 2012, we recognized additional federal net operating loss (“NOL”)
carry-forwards resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $8 million. As a result of the acquisition of Oakleaf in 2011, we received income tax attributes (primarily federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards) and
allocated a portion of the purchase price to these acquired assets. At the time of the acquisition, we fully recognized all of the income tax attributes identified by the seller and concluded the realization of these attributes did not affect our
overall provision for income taxes. In 2012, as a result of new information, we recognized the tax benefit related to additional federal net operating loss carry-forwards received in the Oakleaf acquisition.

Tax Implications of Impairments

— A portion of the impairment charges recognized are not deductible for tax purposes. Had the
charges been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have been reduced by $8 million, $235 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively. See Notes 6 and 13 for more information related
to asset impairments and unusual items.

Unremitted Earnings in Foreign Subsidiaries

— At December 31, 2014, remaining
unremitted earnings in foreign operations were approximately $750 million, which are considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision for U.S. income taxes were accrued for these unremitted earnings. Determination of the unrecognized
deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to uncertainties related to the timing and source of any potential distribution of such funds, along with other important factors such as the amount of associated foreign tax credits.

The valuation allowance increased by $151 million in 2014 due to changes in our capital loss carry-forwards
and in our state NOL and tax credit carry-forwards, as well as the tax impacts of impairments.

At December 31, 2014, we had $28
million of federal NOL carry-forwards and $1.6 billion of state NOL carry-forwards. The federal and state NOL carry-forwards have expiration dates through the year 2034. We also have $519 million of federal capital loss carry-forwards which expire
in 2019. In addition, we have $33 million of state tax credit carry-forwards at December 31, 2014.

We have established valuation
allowances for uncertainties in realizing the benefit of certain tax loss and credit carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. While we expect to realize the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances, changes in estimates of future
taxable income or in tax laws may alter this expectation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

These liabilities are included as a component of long-term “Other liabilities” in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the Company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2014, $28 million of net unrecognized tax benefits, if
recognized in future periods, would impact our effective tax rate.

We recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in
income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $1 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively, of such interest expense as a component of our provisions for income taxes. We had $3 million and $7
million of accrued interest expense in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not have any accrued liabilities or expense for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

We are not able to reasonably estimate when we might make any cash payments required to settle
these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity. As of December 31, 2014 we anticipate that approximately $12 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits,
including accrued interest, and $3 million of related tax assets may be reversed within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals primarily relate to state tax items, none of which are material, and are expected to result from audit settlements
or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period.

Bonus Depreciation

The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law on December 19, 2014 and included an extension for one year of the bonus
depreciation allowance. As a result, 50% of qualifying capital expenditures on property placed in service before January 1, 2015 were depreciated immediately. The acceleration of deductions on 2014 qualifying capital expenditures resulting from
the bonus depreciation provisions had no impact on our effective income tax rate for 2014 although it will reduce our cash taxes. This reduction will be offset by increased cash taxes in subsequent periods when the deductions related to the capital
expenditures would have otherwise been taken.

10. Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plans —

Waste Management sponsors 401(k) retirement savings plans that cover
employees, except those working subject to collective bargaining agreements that do not allow for coverage under such plans. United States employees who are not subject to such collective bargaining agreements are generally eligible to participate
in one of our plans following a 90-day waiting period after hire and may contribute as much as 25% of their annual compensation, subject to annual contribution limitations established by the IRS. Under our largest retirement savings plan, we match,
in cash, 100% of employee contributions on the first 3% of their eligible compensation and 50% of employee contributions on the next 3% of their eligible compensation, resulting in a maximum match of 4.5% of eligible compensation. Both employee and
Company contributions vest immediately. Certain United States employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements may participate in a Company-sponsored 401(k) retirement savings plan under terms specified in their collective bargaining
agreement. Certain employees outside the United States, including those in Canada, participate in defined contribution plans maintained by the Company in compliance with laws of the appropriate jurisdiction. Charges to “Operating” and
“Selling, general and administrative” expenses for our defined contribution plans were $63 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

bargaining agreements that provide for participation in that plan. Further, qualifying Canadian employees participate in defined benefit plans sponsored by certain of our Canadian subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2014, the combined benefit obligation of these pension plans was $121 million, and the plans had $90 million of plan assets, resulting in an unfunded benefit obligation for these plans of $31 million.

In addition, WM Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries provided post-retirement health care and other benefits to eligible retirees. In
conjunction with our acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998, we limited participation in these plans to participating retirees as of December 31, 1998. The unfunded benefit obligation for these plans was $33 million at December 31, 2014.

Our accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans are $64 million as of December 31,
2014 and are included as components of “Accrued liabilities” and long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans —

We are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer,
defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that (i) assets contributed to the
multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be
required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and (iii) if we choose to stop participating in any of our multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the
plan. The following table outlines our participation in multiemployer plans considered to be individually significant (dollar amounts in millions):

(a)

Unless otherwise noted in the table, the most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2014 and 2013 is for the plan’s year-end at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The zone status is
based on information that we received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. As defined in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, among other factors, plans reported as critical are generally less than 65% funded and plans reported
as endangered are generally less than 80% funded.

(b)

The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates plans for which a Funding Improvement Plan (“FIP”) or a Rehabilitation Plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented.

(c)

A multiemployer defined benefit pension plan that has been certified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical may begin to levy a statutory surcharge on contribution rates. Once authorized, the surcharge is at
the rate of 5% for the first 12 months and 10% for any periods thereafter. Contributing employers, however, may eliminate the surcharge by entering into a collective bargaining agreement that meets the requirements of the applicable FIP or RP.

(d)

The Company was listed in the Form 5500 of the multiemployer plans considered to be individually significant as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for each of the following plans and plan years:

(e)

The Company believes there are no collective bargaining agreements remaining that require continuing contributions to this plan; however, this point is the subject of pending litigation with the trustees for the Central
States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan.

Our portion of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and
unfunded liability of the multiemployer pension plans is not material to our financial position. However, the failure of participating employers to remain solvent could affect our portion of the plans’ unfunded liability. Specific benefit
levels provided by union pension plans are not negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.

In connection with our ongoing
renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. Further, business events, such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a
customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations, which result in the decline of Company contributions to a multiemployer pension plan could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal.
In the event of a withdrawal, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized aggregate charges of $4 million, $5 million and $10 million,
respectively, to “Operating” expenses for the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from multiemployer pension plans. Refer to Note 11 for additional information related to our obligations to multiemployer plans for which we have
withdrawn or partially withdrawn.

Multiemployer Plan Benefits Other Than Pensions —

During the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 the Company made contributions of $34 million, $34 million and $36 million, respectively, to multiemployer health and welfare plans that also provide other postretirement employee benefits. Funding of benefit
payments for plan participants are made at rates as negotiated in the respective collective bargaining agreements as costs are incurred.

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Financial Instruments

— We have obtained letters of credit, surety bonds and insurance policies and have
established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, environmental remediation and other obligations. Letters of credit
generally are supported by our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and other credit facilities



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

established for that purpose. These facilities are discussed further in Note 7. Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party surety and insurance
companies; (ii) an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) wholly-owned insurance companies, the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds and/or insurance policies on our behalf.

Management does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks of future cost increases and reductions in
available capacity, we continue to evaluate various options to access cost-effective sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance coverage for protection of our assets and operations from certain risks including automobile liability, general liability, real and personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’
liability, pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy. Our exposure,
however, could increase if our insurers are unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a significant portion of
the risks related to our automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. “General liability” refers to the self-insured portion of specific third party claims made against us that may be covered under our
commercial General Liability Insurance Policy. For our self-insured retentions, the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The
accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from our assumptions used. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial General Liability Insurance Policy carried self-insurance
exposures of up to $2.5 million per incident and our workers’ compensation insurance program carried self-insurance exposures of up to $5 million per incident. As of December 31, 2014, our auto liability insurance program included a
per-incident base deductible of $5 million, subject to additional deductibles of $4.8 million in the $5 million to $10 million layer. Self-insurance claims reserves acquired as part of our acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998 were discounted at
2.0% at December 31, 2014, 3.0% at December 31, 2013 and 1.75% at December 31, 2012. The changes to our net insurance liabilities for the three years ended December 31, 2014 are summarized below (in millions):

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(b)

We currently expect substantially all of our net claims liability to be settled in cash over the next five years.

The Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance policy we choose to maintain covers only individual executive liability, often
referred to as “Broad Form Side A,” and does not provide corporate reimbursement coverage, often referred to as “Side B.” The Side A policy covers directors and officers directly for loss, including defense costs, when corporate
indemnification is unavailable. Side A-only coverage cannot be exhausted by payments to the Company, as the Company is not insured for any money it advances for defense costs or pays as indemnity to the insured directors and officers.

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating Leases

— Rental expense for leased properties was
$159 million during 2014, $170 million during 2013 and $180 million during 2012. Minimum contractual payments due for our operating lease obligations are $103 million in 2015, $83 million in 2016, $70 million in 2017, $57 million in 2018, $47
million in 2019 and $308 million thereafter. Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during future periods is less than current year rent expense due to short-term leases and the sale of our Wheelabrator business.

Other Commitments

•

Disposal

— We have several agreements expiring at various dates through 2052 that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under these put-or-pay
agreements, we are required to pay for the agreed upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the facilities. We generally fulfill our minimum contractual obligations by disposing of volumes collected in the ordinary
course of business at these disposal facilities.

Additionally, following the sale of our Wheelabrator business, we entered
into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally provide for fixed volume commitments, with certain market price resets, for up to seven years.

•

Waste Paper

— We are party to waste paper purchase agreements expiring at various dates through 2018 that require us to purchase a minimum number of tons of waste paper. The cost per ton we pay is
based on market prices.

•

Royalties

— We have various arrangements that require us to make royalty payments to third parties including prior land owners, lessors or host communities where our operations are located. Our
obligations generally are based on per ton rates for waste actually received at our transfer stations, landfills or waste-to-energy facilities. Royalty agreements that are non-cancelable and require fixed or minimum payments are included in our
“Capital leases and other” debt obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as disclosed in Note 7.

Our
unconditional purchase obligations are generally established in the ordinary course of our business and are structured in a manner that provides us with access to important resources at competitive, market-driven rates. We may also establish
unconditional purchase obligations in conjunction with acquisitions or divestitures. Our actual future minimum obligations under these outstanding purchase agreements are generally quantity driven and, as a result, our associated financial
obligations are not fixed as of December 31, 2014. For contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products
or services. As of December 31, 2014, our estimated minimum obligations for the above-described purchase obligations, which are not recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, were $189 million in 2015, $172 million in 2016, $156 million in
2017, $116 million in 2018, $91 million in 2019 and $430 million thereafter. We currently expect the products and services



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provided by these agreements to continue to meet the needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect these established arrangements to materially impact our future financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following guarantee agreements
associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2014, WM Holdings has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WM’s senior indebtedness, including its senior notes, $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement and certain letter of
credit facilities, which mature through 2039. WM has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior indebtedness of WM Holdings, which matures in 2026. Performance under these guarantee agreements would be required if either party defaulted on
their respective obligations. No additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees because the underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 23 for further information.

•

WM and WM Holdings have guaranteed subsidiary debt obligations, including the Canadian credit facility, tax-exempt bonds, capital leases and other indebtedness. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations
associated with its debt agreements as they come due, WM or WM Holdings will be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees because the underlying obligations are
reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 for information related to the balances and maturities of our tax-exempt bonds.

•

Before the divestiture of our Wheelabrator business, WM had guaranteed certain performance and financial guarantees of Wheelabrator and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. In conjunction with the
divestiture, certain WM guarantees of Wheelabrator obligations were terminated, but others continued and are now guarantees of third-party obligations. Wheelabrator is working with the various third-party beneficiaries to release WM from these
guarantees, but until they are successful, WM has agreed to retain the guarantees and, in exchange, receive a credit support fee. The most significant of these guarantees specifically define WM’s maximum financial obligation over the course of
the relevant agreements, and as of December 31, 2014, WM’s maximum future payments associated with those guarantees is $176 million. WM’s exposure under certain of the performance guarantees is variable and a maximum exposure is not
defined. We have recorded the fair value of the financial and performance guarantees, some of which could extend through 2041 if not sooner terminated, in our December 31, 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The estimated fair value of WM’s
potential obligation associated with guarantees of Wheelabrator obligations is $18 million (net of credit support fee). We currently do not expect the financial impact of such performance and financial guarantees to materially exceed the recorded
fair value.

•

We have guaranteed certain financial obligations of unconsolidated entities. The related obligations, which mature through 2020, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2014, our
maximum future payments associated with these guarantees are approximately $8 million. Any requirement to act under these guarantees would not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market or contractually-determined value of certain homeowners’ properties that are adjacent to certain of our landfills. These guarantee agreements extend
over the life of the respective landfill. Under these agreements, we would be responsible for the difference, if any, between the sale value and the guaranteed market or contractually-determined value of the homeowners’ properties. As of
December 31, 2014, we have agreements guaranteeing certain market value losses for approximately 800 homeowners’ properties adjacent to or near 20 of our landfills. We do not believe that these contingent obligations will have a material
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

We have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items that are currently
recorded as obligations, we do not believe that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations associated with these indemnities. Additionally, under certain of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional consideration to be
paid to the sellers if established financial targets are achieved post-closing. We have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on an estimate of the fair value of these contingencies at the time of acquisition. Contingent
obligations related to indemnifications arising from our divestitures and contingent consideration provided for by our acquisitions are not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

WM and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial and general operating obligations of certain of their subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual obligations as they come due, the
guarantor has an unconditional obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has been recorded for service, financial or general operating guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly accounted for as costs of
operations as services are provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly accounted for as operating or capital
leases, as appropriate.

Environmental Matters

— A significant portion of our operating costs and capital
expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection as we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for
environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to remediation activity required by state or local authorities, such liabilities include potentially responsible
party, or PRP, investigations. The costs associated with these liabilities can include settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as incremental internal and external costs directly associated with site investigation and clean-up.

As of December 31, 2014, we had been notified by the government that we are a PRP in connection with 75 locations listed on the
EPA’s Superfund National Priorities List, or NPL. Of the 75 sites at which claims have been made against us, 14 are sites we own. Each of the NPL sites we own was initially developed by others as a landfill disposal facility. At each of these
facilities, we are working in conjunction with the government to characterize or remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing the costs of remediation or are working
toward a cost-sharing agreement. We generally expect to receive any amounts due from other participating parties at or near the time that we make the remedial expenditures. The other 61 NPL sites, which we do not own, are at various procedural
stages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of these proceedings involving NPL sites that we do not own are based on allegations that certain of our subsidiaries (or their
predecessors) transported hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to or disposing at the sites. Proceedings
arising under Superfund typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or recover costs associated with site investigation and remediation, which costs could be substantial and
could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. At some of the sites at which we have been identified as a PRP, our liability is well defined as a consequence of a governmental decision and an agreement among liable
parties as to the share each will pay for implementing that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has been selected or the liable parties have been unable to agree on an appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On December 22, 2011, the Harris County Attorney in Houston, Texas filed suit against
McGinnes Industrial Maintenance Corporation (“MIMC”), WM and Waste Management of Texas, Inc., et al., seeking civil penalties and attorneys’ fees for alleged violations of the Texas Water Code and the Texas Health and Safety Code. The
County’s Original Petition filed with the District Court of Harris County, Texas (the “District Court”) alleges the mismanagement of certain waste pits that were operated from 1965 to 1966 by MIMC. In 1998, a predecessor of WM
acquired the stock of the parent entity of MIMC. On October 9, 2014, the District Court granted a motion for summary judgment that resulted in the dismissal of WM from the case. On November 12, 2014, the parties agreed to resolve this
case with a $29.2 million settlement payment by MIMC and dismissal of the claims against Waste Management of Texas, Inc. The entire settlement amount was funded into escrow in November 2014, pending finalization of the settlement. We remain focused
on the remediation of the site and maintain our active participation in the EPA process established to evaluate and determine the appropriate remedy.

Additionally, on April 30, 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii issued an indictment against Waste
Management of Hawaii, Inc. (“WMHI”) and two employees of WMHI. The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Hawaii had been investigating water discharges at the Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill, which WMHI operates for
the city and county of Honolulu, in connection with three major rainstorms in December 2010 and January 2011. The indictment alleges violations of the federal Clean Water Act, conspiracy and making false statements to the Hawaii Department of Health
and the EPA. We are vigorously defending against this action. Given the early stage of this case and significant issues in dispute, we cannot currently predict an outcome or estimate a range of loss, but we could potentially be subject to sanctions,
including requirements to pay monetary penalties.

Litigation

— In October 2011 and January 2012, we were named as a defendant
in a purported class action in the Circuit Court of Sarasota County, Florida and the Circuit Court of Lawrence County, Alabama, respectively. These cases primarily pertain to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices, generally
alleging that such charges were not properly disclosed, were unfair and were contrary to the customer service contracts. We have reached a settlement in principal of both the pending Florida and Alabama cases, and we are currently working on
documentation for the settlements. We anticipate seeking preliminary court approval of the Florida case settlement during the first quarter of 2015, with the Alabama case settlement to follow. The anticipated settlements will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

From time to time, we are also
named as defendants in personal injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have contaminated the environment or, in
certain cases, on the basis of having conducted environmental remediation activities at sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of monitoring of allegedly affected sites and health care examinations of allegedly affected
persons for a substantial period of time even where no actual damage is proven. While we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, the ultimate resolution is often substantially uncertain due to the difficulty of determining the cause,
extent and impact of alleged contamination (which may have occurred over a long period of time), the potential for successive groups of complainants to emerge, the diversity of the individual plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential
contribution or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or other third parties, among other factors. Additionally, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions
upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As a large company with operations across the United States and Canada, we are subject to
various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us include commercial, customer,
and employment-related claims, including purported class action lawsuits related to our sales and marketing practices and our customer service agreements and purported class actions involving federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The
plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. These actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We currently do not believe that the eventual outcome of any such actions
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

WM’s
charter and bylaws provide that WM shall indemnify against all liabilities and expenses, and upon request shall advance expenses to, any person who is subject to a pending or threatened proceeding because such person is a director or officer of the
Company. Such indemnification is required to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law. Accordingly, the director or officer must execute an undertaking to reimburse the Company for any fees advanced if it is later determined that the director
or officer was not entitled to have such fees advanced under Delaware law. Additionally, WM has entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of the members of its Board of Directors, its Chief Executive Officer and each of its
executive vice presidents. Additionally, the employment agreements between WM and its Chief Executive Officer and other executive and senior vice presidents contain a direct contractual obligation of the Company to provide indemnification to the
executive. The Company may incur substantial expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and indemnification obligations in connection with actions or proceedings that may be brought against its former or current
officers, directors and employees.

Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans

— About 20% of our workforce is covered by
collective bargaining agreements with various union locals across the United States and Canada. As a result of some of these agreements, certain of our subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined
benefit pension plans for the covered employees. Refer to Note 10 for additional information about our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans considered individually significant. In connection with our ongoing renegotiation of
various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. A complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan may also occur if employees
covered by a collective bargaining agreement vote to decertify a union from continuing to represent them. Any other circumstance resulting in a decline in Company contributions to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan through a reduction in
the labor force, whether through attrition over time or through a business event (such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations) may
also trigger a complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans.

One of the most significant multiemployer pension
plans in which we have participated is the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (“Central States Pension Plan”). The Central States Pension Plan is in “critical status,” as defined by the Pension Protection
Act of 2006. Since 2008, certain of our affiliates have bargained to remove covered employees from the Central States Pension Plan, resulting in a series of withdrawals, and we have recognized charges to “Operating” expenses associated
with the withdrawal of certain bargaining units from the Central States Pension Plan and other underfunded multiemployer pension plans. In October 2011, employees at the last of our affiliates with active participants in the Central States Pension
Plan voted to decertify the union that represented them, withdrawing themselves from the Central States Pension Plan. The Company believes there are no collective bargaining agreements remaining that require continuing contributions to this plan;
however, this point is the subject of pending litigation with the trustees for the Central States Pension Plan.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We are still negotiating and litigating final resolutions of our withdrawal liability for
certain previous withdrawals. Except in the case of our withdrawals from the Central States Pension Plan, we do not believe any additional liability above the charges we have already recognized for such previous withdrawals could be material to the
Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. In addition to charges recognized in prior years, we currently estimate that we could incur up to approximately $40 million in future charges based on
demands from representatives of the Central States Pension Plan. As a result, we do not anticipate that the final resolution of the Central States Pension Plan matter could be material to the Company’s business, financial condition or
liquidity; however, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and, to a lesser extent, our results of operations, for a particular reporting period. Similarly, we also do not believe that any future withdrawals, individually
or in the aggregate, from the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or liquidity. However, such withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period, depending on the number of employees withdrawn in any future period and the financial condition of the multiemployer pension plan(s) at the time of such withdrawal(s).

— We participate in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process, which means we work with the IRS throughout the year
in order to resolve any material issues prior to the filing of our annual tax return. We are currently in the examination phase of IRS audits for the tax years 2013, 2014 and 2015 and expect these audits to be completed within the next three, 15 and
27 months, respectively. We are also currently undergoing audits by various state and local jurisdictions for tax years that date back to 2009, with the exception of affirmative claims in a limited number of jurisdictions that date back to 2000. We
are also under audit in Canada for the tax years 2012 and 2013. In 2011, we acquired Oakleaf, which is subject to potential IRS examination for the year 2011. Pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of Oakleaf, we are entitled to indemnification
for Oakleaf’s pre-acquisition period tax liabilities. We maintain a liability for uncertain tax positions, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities are not currently expected to
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

2014 Restructuring

— In August 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several
Corporate functions to better support achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, including cost reduction. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations. Approximately 650 employees have
separated from our Corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring, but we do not anticipate that all of these positions will be permanently eliminated.

During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $70 million was
related to employee severance and benefit costs. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized. We do not expect to incur any material charges associated with our 2014
restructuring in future periods.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a total of $18 million of pre-tax
restructuring charges, of which $7 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with our acquisitions of Greenstar, LLC (“Greenstar”) and RCI and our 2012 restructurings discussed below. The
remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

Restructuring —

In July 2012, we announced a reorganization of operations, designed to streamline management and staff support and reduce our cost structure, while not disrupting our front-line operations. Principal organizational changes
included removing the management layer of our four geographic Groups, each of which previously constituted a reportable segment, and consolidating and reducing the number of our geographic Areas through which we evaluate and oversee our Solid Waste
subsidiaries from 22 to 17. This reorganization eliminated approximately 700 employee positions throughout the Company, including positions at both the management and support level. Voluntary separation arrangements were offered to many employees.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a total of $67 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $56 million
were related to employee severance and benefit costs associated with these reorganizations. The remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.

Through December 31, 2014, we had recognized charges of $133 million related to employee severance and benefits associated with our
restructuring efforts beginning in 2012 and we have paid approximately $94 million of these costs. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $33 million of accrued employee severance related to our restructuring efforts, which will be
substantially paid through the end of 2015.

13. Asset Impairments and Unusual Items

Goodwill impairments

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling
operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $509 million of goodwill impairment charges, primarily related to (i) $483 million associated with our Wheelabrator business; (ii) $10 million associated with our
Puerto Rico operations and (iii) $9 million associated with a majority-owned waste diversion technology company. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $4 million related to certain of our
non-Solid Waste operations. See Notes 3 and 6 for additional information related to these impairment charges as well as the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments.

WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized net income of $170 million,
primarily related to the following:

•

(Income) expense from divestitures

— We recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of
certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. Partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets. Refer to Note 19 for
additional information related to our divestitures.

•

Oil and gas properties impairments

— We recognized $272 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties, primarily as a result of the pronounced decrease in oil and gas prices in
the fourth quarter of 2014. We wrote down the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value using an income approach.

•

Other impairments

— We recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized net charges of $464 million, primarily related to the
following:

•

Landfill impairments

— We recognized $262 million of charges to impair certain of our landfills, primarily as a result of our consideration of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2013 not to
actively pursue expansion and/or development of such landfills. These charges were primarily associated with two landfills in our Eastern Canada Area, which are no longer accepting waste. We had previously concluded that receipt of permits for these
landfills was probable. However, in connection with our asset rationalization and capital allocation analysis, which was influenced, in part, by our acquisition of RCI, we determined that the future costs to construct these landfills could be
avoided as we are able to allocate disposal that would have gone to these landfills to other facilities and not materially impact operations. As a result of management’s decision, we determined that the landfill assets were no longer able
to be recovered by the undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. As such, we wrote them down to their estimated fair values using a market approach considering the highest and best use of the assets.

•

Waste-to-energy impairments

— We recognized $144 million of impairment charges relating to three waste-to-energy facilities, primarily as a result of closure or anticipated closure due to continued
difficulty securing sufficient volumes to operate the plants at capacity and the prospect of additional capacity entering the market where the largest facility is located. We wrote down the carrying value of our facilities to their estimated fair
value using a market approach.

•

Other impairments

— The remainder of our 2013 charges were attributable to (i) $31 million of charges to impair various recycling assets; (ii) $20 million of charges to write down assets related to
a majority-owned waste diversion technology company; and (iii) a $15 million charge to write down the carrying value of an oil and gas property to its estimated fair value.

•

Divestitures —

Partially offsetting these charges were $8 million of net gains on divestitures.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized impairment charges of $79 million, attributable to (i) $45 million of charges
related to three facilities in our medical waste services business as a result of projected operating losses at each of these facilities; (ii) $20 million of charges related to investments in waste diversion technology companies and
(iii) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values, all of which are individually immaterial.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

See Notes 3 and 21 for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis
involved in identifying and calculating impairments; and information related to the impact of impairments on the results of operations of our reportable segments, respectively.

Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized charges of $11 million primarily to write down equity method investments in waste
diversion technology companies to their fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a charge of $10 million related to a payment we made under a guarantee on behalf of an unconsolidated entity that went into
liquidation. This investment was accounted for under the equity method.

Other income (expense)

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized impairment charges of $22 million relating to other-than-temporary declines in the
value of investments in waste diversion technology companies accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down the carrying value of our investments to their fair value.

In the first quarter of 2014, we sold our investment in SEG, which was part of our Wheelabrator business. We received cash proceeds from the
sale of $155 million, which have been included in “Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested)” within “Net cash used in investing activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The
losses recognized related to the sale were not material.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized impairment charges
of $71 million relating to other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies accounted for under the cost method. We wrote down the carrying value of our investments to their fair value, which was
primarily determined using an income approach based on estimated future cash flow projections obtained in the fourth quarter of 2013 and, to a lesser extent, third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities. Partially
offsetting these charges was a $4 million gain on the sale of a similar investment recognized in the second quarter of 2013.

During the
year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of $16 million relating to an other-than-temporary decline in the value of another investment in a waste diversion technology company accounted for under the cost method. We wrote
down the carrying value of our investment to its fair value based on other third-party investors’ recent transactions in these securities, which are considered to be the best evidence of fair value currently available.

These net charges are recorded in “Other, net” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

15. Capital Stock, Dividends and Share Repurchases

Capital Stock

We have 1.5 billion shares of authorized common stock with a par value of $0.01 per common share. As of December 31, 2014, we had
458.5 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in series, and with respect to each series, to fix its designation, relative rights (including voting, dividend,
conversion, sinking fund, and redemption rights), preferences (including dividends and liquidation) and limitations. We have 10 million shares of authorized preferred stock, $0.01 par value, none of which is currently outstanding.

Dividends

Our
quarterly dividends have been declared and paid in accordance with our financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were $693 million in 2014, or $1.50 per common share, $683 million in 2013, or $1.46 per
common share and $658 million in 2012, or $1.42 per common share.

In February 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to
increase the quarterly dividend from $0.375 to $0.385 per share for dividends declared in 2015. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings,
financial condition, cash required for future business plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant.

Share Repurchases

Our share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. The following is a summary of our
share repurchases for the periods presented. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock in 2012.

$600

$239

(a)

In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized up to $600 million in share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with two
financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of $600 million of our common stock. At the beginning of the ASR repurchase periods, we delivered the $600 million in cash and received 9.6 million shares, which represented 70% of the shares
expected to be repurchased based on then-current market prices. These agreements were completed in February 2015 and we received approximately 2.8 million additional shares. The final weighted average per share purchase price for the completed
ASR agreements was $48.58.

The ASR agreements were accounted for as two separate transactions: (i) as shares of
reacquired common stock for the shares delivered to us upon effectiveness of the ASR agreements and (ii) as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock for the undelivered shares. The initial delivery of shares is included in treasury
stock at a cost of $420 million and resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. The $180 million forward contract indexed to
our own stock met the criteria for equity classification and this amount was recorded in additional paid-in capital.

We announced in
February 2015 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1 billion in future share repurchases. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board in
making dividend declarations.

16. Stock-Based Compensation

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) under which employees that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase
shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for two offering periods for purchases: January through June and July through December. At the end of each offering period, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a
price equal to 85% of the lesser of the market value of the stock on the first and last day of such offering period. The purchases are made at the end of an offering period with funds accumulated through payroll deductions over the course of the
offering period, and the number of shares that may be purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The total number of shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately 774,000, 928,000 and
1 million, respectively. Including the impact of the January 2015 issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2014 offering period, approximately 1.0 million shares remain available for issuance under the plan.

Accounting for our ESPP increased annual compensation expense by approximately by $6 million, or $4 million net of tax, for both 2014 and 2013
and by $7 million, or $4 million net of tax, for 2012.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Employee Stock Incentive Plans

In May 2014, our stockholders approved our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) to replace our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“2009 Plan”). The 2014 Plan authorized 23.8 million shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan, plus the approximately 1.1 million shares that then remained available for issuance under the 2009 Plan, and
any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that are subsequently cancelled, forfeited, terminate, expire or lapse. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 25.9 million shares were available for future grants under the 2014
Plan. All of our stock-based compensation awards described herein have been made pursuant to either our 2009 Plan or our 2014 Plan, collectively referred to as the “Incentive Plans.” We currently utilize treasury shares to meet the needs
of our equity-based compensation programs.

Pursuant to the Incentive Plans, we have the ability to issue stock options, stock
appreciation rights and stock awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance share units, or PSUs. The terms and conditions of equity awards granted under the Incentive Plans are determined by the Management
Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

The 2014 annual Incentive Plan awards granted to the Company’s
senior leadership team, which generally includes the Company’s executive officers, included a combination of PSUs and stock options. The annual Incentive Plan awards granted to certain key employees included a combination of PSUs, RSUs and
stock options in 2014. The Company has also periodically granted RSUs and stock options to employees working on key initiatives, in connection with new hires and promotions and to field-based managers.

The total fair market value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
was $3 million, $1 million and $11 million, respectively. Net of units deferred and units used for payment of associated taxes, we issued approximately 42,000 shares of common stock for RSUs that vested during the year ended December 31, 2014.

RSUs may not be voted or sold by award recipients until time-based vesting restrictions have lapsed. RSUs primarily provide for
three-year cliff vesting and include divided equivalents accumulated during the vesting period. Unvested units are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination. RSUs are subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s
retirement or involuntary termination other than for cause and become immediately vested in the event of an employee’s death or disability.

Compensation expense associated with RSUs is measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock and is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the required employment period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of expected forfeitures.

Performance Share Units —

Three types of PSUs are currently outstanding:
(i) PSUs for which payout is dependent on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 (“TSR PSUs”); (ii) PSUs for which payout is dependent on the Company’s performance against pre-established return on invested
capital metrics (“ROIC PSUs”) and (iii) PSUs for which payout is dependent on the Company’s performance against pre-established adjusted cash flow metrics (“Cash Flow PSUs”). All types of PSUs are payable in shares of
common stock after the end of a three-year performance period, when the Company’s financial performance for the entire performance period is reported, typically in mid- to late-February of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance
period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the targeted amount, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. A summary of our PSUs is presented in the table below (units in thousands):

The determination of achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting of PSUs for the three-year
performance period ended December 31, 2014 was performed by the Management Development and Compensation Committee in February 2015. Accordingly, vesting information for such awards is not included in the table above as of December 31,
2014. The “vested” PSUs are for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2013, as achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting was determined in February 2014. The Company’s financial results, as
measured for purposes of these awards, were lower than the target levels established but in excess of the threshold performance criteria. Accordingly, recipients of these PSU awards were entitled to receive a payout of approximately 60% of the
vested PSUs. In early 2014, we issued approximately 106,000 shares of common stock for these vested PSUs, net of units deferred and units used for payment of associated taxes.

The shares of common stock that were earned during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 on account of PSU awards had a fair
market value of $8 million, $14 million and $32 million, respectively. PSUs have no voting rights. PSUs receive dividend equivalents that are paid out in cash based on actual performance at the end of the awards’ performance period. PSUs are
payable to an employee (or his beneficiary) upon death or disability as if that employee had remained employed until the end of the performance period, are subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s retirement or involuntary termination
other than for cause and are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination.

Compensation expense associated
with our ROIC PSUs and Cash Flow PSUs that continue to vest based on future performance is measured based on the fair value of our common stock at the end of each reporting period until the performance period ends. Compensation expense is recognized
ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of both the
probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and expected forfeitures.

The grant-date fair value of our TSR PSUs is based
on a Monte Carlo valuation and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized for all TSR PSUs whether or not the market conditions are achieved less expected forfeitures.

Deferred Units —

Recipients can elect to defer some or all of the vested RSU or
PSU awards until a specified date or dates they choose. Deferred amounts are not invested, nor do they earn interest, but deferred amounts do earn dividend equivalents during deferral. Deferred amounts are paid out in shares of common stock at the
end of the deferral period. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 295,000 vested deferred units outstanding.

Stock Options
—

Stock options granted primarily vest in 25% increments on the first two anniversaries of the date of grant with the remaining 50% vesting on the third anniversary. The exercise price of the options is the average of the high and low
market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and the options have a term of 10 years. A summary of our stock options is presented in the table below (options in thousands):

We received cash proceeds of $93 million, $132 million and $43 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, from employee stock option exercises. We also realized tax benefits from these stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $5 million, $10 million and $5 million, respectively. These amounts
have been presented as cash inflows in the “Cash flows from financing activities” section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2014,
2013 and 2012 was $27 million, $41 million and $15 million, respectively.

All unvested stock options shall become exercisable upon the
award recipient’s death or disability. In the event of a recipient’s retirement, stock options shall continue to vest pursuant to the original schedule set forth in the award agreement. If the recipient is terminated by the Company without
cause or voluntarily resigns, the recipient shall be entitled to exercise all stock options outstanding and exercisable within a specified time frame after such termination. All outstanding stock options, whether exercisable or not, are forfeited
upon termination for cause.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a
Black-Scholes methodology to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $4.55, $4.26 and $4.66,
respectively. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period less expected forfeitures, except for stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees, for which expense is accelerated
over the period that the recipient becomes retirement-eligible. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to value employee stock options granted during the years ended December 31 under the Black-Scholes valuation
model:




Expected option life

4.8 years

5.4 years

5.5 years

Expected volatility

18.4%

21.8%

24.2%

Expected dividend yield

3.6%

4.0%

4.1%

Risk-free interest rate

1.6%

1.0%

1.1%

The Company bases its expected option life on the expected exercise and termination behavior of its optionees
and an appropriate model of the Company’s future stock price. The expected volatility assumption is derived from the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected
life of the Company’s stock options, combined with other relevant factors including implied volatility in market-traded options on the Company’s stock. The dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of
the option as of the grant date.

For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we recognized $59 million, $54 million and $22
million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with RSU, PSU and stock option awards as a component of “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our “Provision for income
taxes” for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 includes related deferred income tax benefits of $23 million, $21 million and $9 million, respectively. We have not capitalized any equity-based compensation costs during the
years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Compensation expense recognized in 2014 increased when compared to 2013, in part due
to the increase in expected payout of our PSUs. Compensation expense recognized in 2013 increased when compared to 2012, in part due to the payout of PSUs granted in 2010, which was approved in 2013. Expense associated with these awards had been
reversed in 2012 when it no longer appeared probable that threshold performance would be achieved. As of December 31, 2014 we estimate that a total of approximately $46 million of currently unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized
over a weighted average period of 1.4 years for unvested RSU, PSU and stock option awards issued and outstanding.

Non-Employee
Director Plan

Our non-employee directors currently receive annual grants of shares of our common stock, generally payable in two
equal installments, under the Incentive Plans described above.

18. Fair Value Measurements

Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact. Fair
value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to
the fair value measurement:

Level 1

— Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2

— Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3

— Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs. In measuring the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate.
Our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following (in millions):

Our electricity commodity derivatives were associated with our Wheelabrator business and were divested in conjunction with the sale of that business in December 2014.

Money Market Funds

We
invest portions of our “Cash and cash equivalents” and restricted trust and escrow account balances in money market funds. We measure the fair value of these investments using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair
value of our money market funds approximates our cost basis in the investments. The increase in the fair value at December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 is primarily attributable to cash proceeds received from the sale of our
Wheelabrator business.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fixed-Income Securities

We invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow balances in fixed-income securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency
securities, municipal securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. We measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets. The fair value of our fixed-income securities
approximates our cost basis in these investments.

Redeemable Preferred Stock

In 2011, we made a noncontrolling investment in redeemable preferred stock of an unconsolidated entity. The fair value of this investment
increased by $4 million during 2014 due to an increase in the price per share established in a recent stock issuance. In addition, we received $15 million of redeemable preferred stock in conjunction with the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and
certain other collection and landfill assets in the second quarter of 2014, as discussed in Note 19.

Such preferred stock is included in
“Investments in unconsolidated entities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair values of these investments have been measured based on third-party investors’ recent or pending transactions in these securities, which are
considered the best evidence of fair value currently available. When this evidence is not available, we use other valuation techniques as appropriate and available. These valuation methodologies may include transactions in similar instruments,
discounted cash flow techniques, third-party appraisals or industry multiples and public comparables.

Foreign Currency Derivatives

Our foreign currency derivatives are valued using a third-party pricing model that incorporates information about forward Canadian
dollar rates, or observable market data, as of the reporting date. The third-party pricing model used to value our foreign currency derivatives also incorporates Company and counterparty credit valuation adjustments, as appropriate. Counterparties
to these contracts are financial institutions who participate in our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. Valuations may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period due to volatility in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate.

Interest Rate Derivatives

As of December 31, 2013, we were party to forward-starting interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated
interest payments for future fixed-rate debt issuances. Our forward-starting interest rate swaps were LIBOR-based instruments. Accordingly, these derivatives were valued using a third-party pricing model that incorporated information about LIBOR
yield curves, which is considered observable market data, for each instrument’s respective term. The third-party pricing model used to value our interest rate derivatives also incorporated Company and counterparty credit valuation adjustments,
as appropriate. Counterparties to our interest rate contracts are financial institutions who participate in our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. During the first quarter of 2014, our forward-starting interest rate swaps matured.

Refer to Notes 8 and 14 for additional information regarding our derivative instruments discussed above.

Fair Value of Debt

At December 31, 2014 the carrying value of our debt was approximately $9.4 billion compared with approximately $10.2 billion at
December 31, 2013. The carrying value of our debt includes adjustments associated with fair value hedge accounting related to our interest rate swaps as discussed in Note 8.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately $10.6 billion at December 31,
2014 and approximately $11.0 billion at December 31, 2013. The estimated fair value of our senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The carrying value of remarketable debt and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities approximates
fair value due to the short-term nature of the interest rates. The fair value of our other debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current market rates for similar types of instruments. The decrease in the fair value of our
debt when comparing December 31, 2014 with December 31, 2013 is primarily related to $751 million of net repayments during 2014, partially offset by increases in the fair value attributable to an increase in market prices for fixed-rate
corporate debt securities as a result of recent decreases in long-term interest rates.

Although we have determined the estimated fair
value amounts using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The fair value
estimates are based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy available as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the
amounts presented.

19. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Pending Acquisition

On September 17, 2014, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Deffenbaugh Disposal, Inc., one of
the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the Midwest. Closing of the acquisition is expected to occur in early 2015, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Current Year Acquisitions

We continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are accretive to our Solid Waste business and enhance and expand our existing service
offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 15 businesses related to our Solid Waste business. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for all acquisitions was $32 million, which included $26 million in cash paid in 2014
and a liability for contingent consideration with a preliminary estimated fair value of $6 million. The contingent consideration is primarily based on achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals, which generally include
targeted revenues. Our estimated maximum obligations for the contingent cash payments were $6 million at the dates of acquisition. As of December 31, 2014, we had paid $4 million of this contingent consideration. In 2014, we also paid $5
million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions completed prior to 2014.

The allocation of purchase price for 2014
acquisitions was primarily to “Property and equipment,” which had an estimated fair value of $6 million; “Other intangible assets,” which had an estimated fair value of $9 million; and “Goodwill” of $17 million. Other
intangible assets included $7 million of customer and supplier relationships and $2 million of covenants not-to-compete. Goodwill is primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and is
tax deductible.

Prior Year Acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we acquired Greenstar and substantially all of the assets of RCI, which are discussed further
below. Additionally, we acquired 14 other businesses primarily related to our Solid



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Waste business and energy services operations. Total consideration, inclusive of $7 million for estimated working capital, for all acquisitions was $772 million, which included $714 million in
cash paid in 2013, debt of $22 million and a liability for contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of $29 million. The contingent consideration is primarily based on changes in certain recycling commodity indexes and, to a lesser
extent, contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals, which generally include targeted revenues. Our estimated maximum obligations for the contingent cash payments were $33 million at the dates of
acquisition. As of December 31, 2013, we had paid $4 million of this contingent consideration. In 2013, we also paid $6 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions completed prior to 2013.

The allocation of purchase price for 2013 acquisitions was primarily to “Property and equipment,” which had an estimated fair value
of $195 million; “Other intangible assets,” which had an estimated fair value of $232 million; and “Goodwill” of $327 million. Other intangible assets included $218 million of customer and supplier relationships, $5 million of
covenants not-to-compete and $9 million of other intangible assets. Goodwill is primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and is generally tax deductible.

Acquisition of Greenstar, LLC

On January 31, 2013, we paid $170 million inclusive of certain adjustments, to acquire Greenstar. Pursuant to the sale and purchase
agreement, up to an additional $40 million is payable to the sellers during the period from 2014 to 2018, of which $20 million is guaranteed. The remaining $20 million of this consideration is contingent based on changes in certain recyclable
commodity indexes and had an estimated fair value at closing of $16 million. Greenstar was an operator of recycling and resource recovery facilities. This acquisition provides the Company’s customers with greater access to recycling solutions,
having supplemented our extensive nationwide recycling network with the operations of one of the nation’s largest private recyclers.

Goodwill of $122 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future
economic benefits expected to arise from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill has been assigned predominantly to our Areas and, to a lesser extent, our recycling brokerage services, as
they are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Goodwill related to this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes. There have been no material adjustments to the purchase price allocation since the date of acquisition.

Acquisition of RCI Environnement, Inc.

On July 5, 2013, we paid C$509 million, or $481 million, to acquire substantially all of the assets of RCI, the largest waste management
company in Quebec, and certain related entities. Total consideration, inclusive of amounts for estimated working capital, was C$515 million, or $487 million. RCI provides collection, transfer, recycling and disposal operations throughout the Greater
Montreal area. The acquired RCI operations complement and expand the Company’s existing assets and operations in Quebec.

Goodwill of
$191 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately
recognized. Goodwill has been assigned to our Eastern Canada Area as it is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. A portion of goodwill related to this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes in accordance with Canadian
tax law. There have been no material adjustments to the purchase price allocation since the date of acquisition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2012, we paid $94 million for interests in oil and gas producing properties through two
transactions. The purchase price was allocated primarily to “Property and equipment.” Additionally, we acquired 32 other businesses related to our Solid Waste business. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for all acquisitions was
$244 million, which included $207 million in cash paid in 2012, deposits paid during 2011 for acquisitions completed in 2012 of $7 million, a liability for additional cash payments with a preliminary estimated fair value of $22 million, and assumed
liabilities of $8 million. The additional cash payments are contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals, which generally include targeted revenues. At the dates of acquisition, our estimated maximum obligations
for the contingent cash payments were $57 million. As of December 31, 2012, we had paid $9 million of this contingent consideration. In 2012, we also paid $34 million of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions completed prior to
2012.

The allocation of purchase price for 2012 acquisitions was primarily to “Property and equipment,” which had an estimated
fair value of $126 million; “Other intangible assets,” which had an estimated fair value of $43 million; and “Goodwill” of $69 million. Other intangible assets included $34 million of customer contracts and customer relationships
and $9 million of covenants not-to-compete. Goodwill is primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and is tax deductible.

Current Year Divestitures

The aggregate sales price for divestitures of operations was $2.09 billion in 2014, primarily related to (i) the sale of our Wheelabrator
business in December 2014; (ii) the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area in the third quarter of 2014 and (iii) the sale of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill
assets in the second quarter of 2014, as discussed further below. We recognized net gains on these divestitures of $515 million in 2014. These divestitures were made as part of our initiative to improve or divest certain non-strategic or
underperforming operations. The remaining amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows generally relate to the sale of fixed assets.

Divestiture of Wheelabrator Business

On December 19, 2014, we sold our Wheelabrator business to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95
billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale which is included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual
items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain Wheelabrator facilities. These agreements generally
provide for fixed volume commitments, with certain market price resets, for up to seven years.

Our Wheelabrator business met the criteria
to be classified as held-for-sale and was classified as “Businesses held-for-sale” within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2014.

Wheelabrator provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production
plants. Wheelabrator owns or operates 16 waste-to-energy facilities and four independent power production plants. Prior to the sale, our Wheelabrator business constituted a reportable segment, as discussed in Note 21. We concluded
that the sale of our Wheelabrator business did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting under current authoritative guidance based on our significant continuing obligations under the long-term waste supply agreements referred to above and
in Note 11.

In the third quarter of 2014, we sold certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area, which were included in Tier 3. We
received cash proceeds from the sale of $39 million and recognized a gain of $18 million.

The gain or loss on these divestitures is
included within “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments (other than goodwill) and unusual items” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remaining proceeds from divestitures in 2014 were comprised substantially of
cash.

as part of our initiative to improve or divest certain non-strategic or underperforming operations. The remaining amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows generally relate to

20. Variable Interest Entities

Following is a description of our financial interests in variable interest entities that we consider significant, including
(i) those for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity and, therefore, have consolidated the entities into our financial statements; (ii) those that represent a significant interest in an unconsolidated
entity and (iii) trusts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental remediation obligations for both consolidated and unconsolidated variable interest entities.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

Waste-to-Energy LLCs

— In June 2000, two limited liability companies were established to purchase interests in existing leveraged
lease financings at three waste-to-energy facilities that we leased, operated and maintained. Prior to the acquisitions of the noncontrolling interests, we owned a 0.5% interest in one of the LLCs (“LLC I”) and a 0.25% interest in the
second LLC (“LLC II”). John Hancock Life Insurance Company (“Hancock”) owned 99.5% of LLC I and 99.75% of LLC II was owned by LLC I and the CIT Group (“CIT”).

In December 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the LLCs from Hancock and CIT in anticipation of our sale of our Wheelabrator
business. The LLCs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestment. See Note 19 for further discussion of the sale of our Wheelabrator business.

Prior to the acquisitions of the noncontrolling interests, we had determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the LLCs and consolidated
these entities in our Consolidated Financial Statements because (i) all of the equity owners of the LLCs were considered related parties for purposes of applying this accounting guidance; (ii) the equity owners shared power over the
significant activities of the LLCs and (iii) we were the entity within the related party group whose activities were most closely associated with the LLCs.

As of December 31, 2013, our Consolidated Balance Sheets included $284 million of net property and equipment associated with the
LLCs’ waste-to-energy facilities and $239 million in noncontrolling interests associated with Hancock’s and CIT’s interests in the LLCs. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized reductions in
earnings of $39 million, $43 million and $45 million, respectively, for Hancock’s and CIT’s noncontrolling interests in the LLCs’ earnings, which are included in our consolidated net income. The LLCs’ earnings related to the
rental income generated from leasing the facilities to our subsidiaries, reduced by depreciation expense. The LLCs’ rental income is eliminated in WM’s consolidation.

Significant Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

Investment in U.K. Waste-to-Energy and Recycling Entity —

In the first quarter of 2012, we formed a U.K. joint venture (the
“JV”), together with a commercial waste management company (“Partner”), to develop, construct, operate and maintain a waste-to-energy and recycling facility in England. We owned a 50% interest in the JV. We determined that we
were not the primary beneficiary of the JV, as all major decisions of the JV require either majority vote or unanimous consent of the directors (who were appointed in equal numbers by us and our Partner) or unanimous consent of the two shareholders
of the JV. As such, our Partner shared equally in the power to direct the activities of the JV that most significantly impacted its economic performance. Accordingly, we accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting and did not
consolidate this entity.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Following delays in obtaining planning approval, the Norfolk County Council (the
“Council”), which had awarded the project to the JV, held a special meeting on April 7, 2014 and voted to terminate the project agreement with the JV. The JV then exercised its right to accelerate the effective date of the
project agreement’s termination to May 16, 2014. The Council subsequently reimbursed project development costs and losses incurred on certain foreign currency and interest rate derivatives as determined under the project agreement. Our
portion of the loss recognized by the JV for unreimbursed costs was not material and was reflected in our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities.”

Investment in Refined Coal Facility

— In 2011, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to
invest in and manage a refined coal facility. Along with the other equity investor, we support the operations of the entity in exchange for a pro-rata share of the tax credits it generates. Our initial consideration for this investment consisted of
a cash payment of $48 million. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, our investment balance was $32 million and $27 million, respectively, representing our current maximum pre-tax exposure to loss. Under the terms and conditions of the transaction, we
do not believe that we have any material exposure to loss. Required capital contributions commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and will continue through the expiration of the tax credits under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code, which
occurs at the end of 2019. We are only obligated to make future contributions to the extent tax credits are generated. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity as we do not have the power to individually direct the
entity’s activities. Accordingly, we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the entity. Additional information related to this investment is discussed in Note 9.

Investment in Low-Income Housing Properties

— In 2010, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company
established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. We support the operations of the entity in exchange for a pro-rata share of the tax credits it generates. Our target return on the investment is guaranteed and, therefore, we do not
believe that we have any material exposure to loss. Our consideration for this investment totaled $221 million, which was comprised of a $215 million note payable and an initial cash payment of $6 million. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, our
investment balance was $104 million and $129 million, respectively, and our debt balance was $104 million and $128 million, respectively. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity as we do not have the power to
individually direct the entity’s activities. Accordingly, we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the entity. Additional information related to this investment is discussed in Note 9.

Trusts for Final Capping, Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation Obligations

— We have significant financial interests
in trust funds that were created to settle certain of our final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental remediation obligations. Generally, we are the sole beneficiary of these restricted balances; however, certain of the funds have been
established for the benefit of both the Company and the host community in which we operate. We have determined that these trust funds are variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of certain of these entities because
either (i) we do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the trusts or (ii) power over the trusts’ significant activities is shared.

We account for the trusts for which we are the sole beneficiary as long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We
reflect our interests in the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities held by these trusts as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” These trusts had a fair value of $129 million at December 31,
2014 and $125 million at December 31, 2013. Our interests in the trusts that have been established for the benefit of both the Company and the host community in which we operate are accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and
receivables. These amounts are recorded in “Other receivables,” “Investments in unconsolidated entities” and long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as appropriate. Our investments and receivables
related to these trusts had an aggregate carrying value of $113 million and $110 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As the party with primary responsibility to fund the related final capping, closure,
post-closure or environmental remediation activities, we are exposed to risk of loss as a result of potential changes in the fair value of the assets of the trust. The fair value of trust assets can fluctuate due to (i) changes in the market
value of the investments held by the trusts and (ii) credit risk associated with trust receivables. Although we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the trust assets, we currently expect the trust funds to continue to meet the statutory
requirements for which they were established.

21. Segment and Related Information

We evaluate, oversee and manage the financial performance of our Solid Waste subsidiaries through our 17 Areas. The 17 Areas
constitute our operating segments and none of the Areas individually meet the quantitative criteria to be a separate reportable segment. We have evaluated the aggregation criteria and concluded that, based on the similarities between our Areas,
including the fact that our Solid Waste business is homogenous across geography with the same services offered across the Areas, aggregation of our Areas is appropriate for purposes of presenting our reportable segments. Accordingly, we have
aggregated our 17 Areas into three tiers that we believe have similar economic characteristics and future prospects based in large part on a review of the Areas’ income from operations margins. The economic variations experienced by our Areas
is attributable to a variety of factors, including regulatory environment of the Area; economic environment of the Area, including level of commercial and industrial activity; population density; service offering mix and disposal logistics, with no
one factor being singularly determinative of an Area’s current or future economic performance. As a result of our consideration of economic and other similarities, we have established the following three reportable segments for our Solid Waste
business: Tier 1, which is comprised almost exclusively of Areas in the Southern United States; Tier 2, which is comprised predominately of Areas located in the Midwest and Northeast United States; and Tier 3, which encompasses all remaining Areas,
including the Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and Eastern Canada.

Our Wheelabrator business, which managed
waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants, continued to be a separate reportable segment until the sale of the business in the fourth quarter of 2014 as it met the quantitative disclosure thresholds.

The operating segments not evaluated and overseen through the 17 Areas are presented herein as “Other” as these operating segments
do not meet the criteria to be aggregated with other operating segments and do not meet the quantitative criteria to be separately reported.

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the respective years ended December 31 is shown in the following

(a)

Our “Other” net operating revenues and “Other” income from operations include (i) the effects of those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and
administration revenues managed by our Energy and Environmental Services and Renewable Energy organizations, that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) our recycling brokerage and electronic recycling services;
and (iii) the impacts of investments in expanded service offerings, such as portable self-storage, fluorescent lamp recycling and oil and gas producing properties. In addition, our “Other” income from operations reflects the impacts
of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for the segments or financing for our Canadian operations.

(b)

Corporate operating results reflect the costs incurred for various support services that are not allocated to our reportable segments. These support services include, among other things, treasury, legal, information
technology, tax, insurance, centralized service center processes, other administrative functions and the maintenance of our closed landfills. Income from operations for “Corporate and other” also includes costs associated with our
long-term incentive program and any administrative expenses or revisions to our estimated obligations associated with divested operations.

(c)

Intercompany operating revenues reflect each segment’s total intercompany sales, including intercompany sales within a segment and between segments. Transactions within and between segments are generally made on a
basis intended to reflect the market value of the service.

(d)

For those items included in the determination of income from operations, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 3.

(e)

The income from operations provided by our Solid Waste business is generally indicative of the margins provided by our collection, landfill, transfer
and recycling businesses. From time to time the operating results of our reportable segments are significantly affected by certain transactions or events that



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

management believes are not indicative or representative of our results. In 2014, we recognized a $519 million gain on the sale of our Wheelabrator business during the fourth quarter. In
2013, we recognized $981 million of impairment charges, the most significant of which impacted our Tier 3 and Wheelabrator segments by $253 million and $627 million, respectively. Refer to Note 12 and Note 13 for an explanation of certain other
transactions and events affecting our operating results.

(f)

Includes non-cash items. Capital expenditures are reported in our reportable segments at the time they are recorded within the segments’ property, plant and equipment balances and, therefore, may include amounts
that have been accrued but not yet paid.

Basic and diluted earnings per common share for each of the quarters presented above is based on the
respective weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding for each quarter and the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted earnings per common share amounts.

Our operating revenues normally tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
trends. Through 2014, the operating results of our first quarter also often reflected higher repair and maintenance expenses because, prior to the sale of our Wheelabrator business, we relied on the slower winter months, when waste flows are
generally lower, to perform scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities. Additionally, from time to time, our operating results are significantly affected by certain transactions or events that management believes are not indicative or
representative of our results. The following significant items have affected the comparison of our operating results during the periods indicated:

First Quarter 2014

•

During the first quarter of 2014, we experienced significantly higher revenues in our Wheelabrator business and the renewable energy operations in Solid Waste from temporarily higher electricity prices driven by
weather-related demand. This increase in revenues offset reduced revenues in our collection and disposal operations due to inclement weather.

Second Quarter 2014

•

The recognition of a pre-tax loss of $25 million on the divestiture of our Puerto Rico operations and certain other collection and landfill assets. No
tax benefit was recorded in connection with the loss. In



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

addition, we incurred $32 million of tax charges to repatriate accumulated cash prior to the divestment. These charges had a negative impact of $0.12 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

The recognition of other net pre-tax charges of $16 million, primarily as a result of a $12 million impairment charge due to the decision to close a waste processing facility. These charges had a negative impact of
$0.03 on our diluted earnings per share.

Third Quarter 2014

•

The recognition of $67 million of pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to our August 2014 restructuring. These items had a negative impact of $0.09 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

The recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $20 million comprised of (i) litigation reserves and (ii) the write down of an investment in a waste diversion technology company, partially offset by a gain on
the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our Eastern Canada Area. These items had a negative impact of $0.05 on our diluted earnings per share.

Fourth Quarter 2014

•

The recognition of a pre-tax gain of $519 million on the sale of our Wheelabrator business, which positively affected our diluted earnings per share by $1.12.

•

Net income was negatively impacted by the recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $364 million comprised of (i) $270 million of charges to impair our oil and gas producing properties; (ii) $25 million
of charges to write down assets related to waste diversion technology companies; (iii) $20 million of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments in waste diversion technology companies accounted for under the cost method;
(iv) $10 million of goodwill impairment charges associated with our recycling operations and (v) other charges to write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values related to certain of our operations. These items had
a negative impact of $0.49 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was negatively impacted by pre-tax restructuring charges of $13 million, which negatively affected our diluted earnings per share by $0.02.

First Quarter 2013

•

Net income was negatively impacted by pre-tax impairment charges aggregating $15 million attributable to investments in waste diversion technology companies and goodwill related to certain of our operations. These items
had a negative impact of $0.03 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was negatively impacted by $8 million of pre-tax restructuring charges related to our acquisition of Greenstar and our July 2012 restructuring. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our
diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was negatively impacted by bad debt expense associated with collection issues in our Puerto Rico operations, which negatively affected our diluted earnings per share by $0.01.

Second Quarter 2013

•

Income from operations was negatively impacted by the recognition of pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges primarily related to an impairment
of a waste-to-energy facility as result of



WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

projected operating losses partially offset by gains on divestitures. These items had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was impacted by a favorable adjustment to “Operating” expenses due to an increase in the risk-free discount rate used to measure our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery
assets, which positively affected our diluted earnings per share by $0.01.

Third Quarter 2013

•

Net income was negatively impacted by the recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $23 million comprised of (i) $18 million related to impairments, primarily attributable to an investment in a majority-owned
waste diversion technology company and (ii) $5 million of losses on divestitures, primarily related to oil and gas producing properties. These items had a negative impact of $0.02 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was negatively impacted by the recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating $8 million primarily associated with the partial withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and, to a
lesser extent, other restructuring charges. These items had a negative impact of $0.01 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was positively impacted as a result of the collection of certain fully reserved receivables related to our Puerto Rico operations, which positively affected our diluted earnings per share by
$0.01.

Fourth Quarter 2013

•

Net income was negatively impacted by the recognition of net pre-tax charges aggregating $1 billion comprised of (i) a $483 million charge to impair goodwill associated with our Wheelabrator business;
(ii) $262 million of charges to impair certain landfills, primarily in our Eastern Canada Area; (iii) $130 million of charges to write down the carrying value of three waste-to-energy facilities; (iv) $61 million of charges
attributable to investments in waste diversion technology companies; (v) $31 million of charges to impair various recycling assets; (vi) a $15 million charge to write down the carrying value of an oil and gas property to its estimated fair
value and (vii) other charges to impair goodwill and write down the carrying value of assets to their estimated fair values related to certain of our operations, partially offset by gains on divestitures. These items had a negative impact of
$1.84 on our diluted earnings per share.

•

Income from operations was negatively impacted by pre-tax restructuring charges of $5 million which negatively affected our diluted earnings per share by $0.01.

•

Income from operations was positively impacted by net adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the timing and cost of future final capping, closure and post-closure of fully utilized airspace, and by
an increase in the risk-free discount rate used to measure environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets. These items positively affected our diluted earnings per share by $0.02.

24. New Accounting Standard Pending Adoption (Unaudited)

In May 2014, the FASB amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition. The amended guidance requires
companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the
amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. The amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The amended guidance
may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial application. We are in the process of assessing the provisions of the
amended guidance and have not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
