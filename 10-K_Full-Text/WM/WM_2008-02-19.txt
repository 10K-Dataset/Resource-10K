Item 1.

Business.

General

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
    our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
    variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary. Waste Management, Inc. is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries.
    When the terms “the Company,” “we,”
    “us” or “our” are used in this document,
    those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., its consolidated
    subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When
    we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to the
    parent holding company.

WMI was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1987 under the name
    “USA Waste Services, Inc.” and was reincorporated as a
    Delaware company in 1995. In a 1998 merger, the Illinois-based
    waste services company formerly known as Waste Management, Inc.
    became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI and changed its name to
    Waste Management Holdings, Inc. At the same time, our parent
    holding company changed its name from USA Waste Services to
    Waste Management, Inc. Like WMI, WM Holdings is a holding
    company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries. For
    detail on the financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows of WMI, WM Holdings and their subsidiaries, see
    Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
    Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. Our telephone
    number at that address is

(713) 512-6200.

are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as
    practicable after we file the reports with the SEC. Our stock is
    traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
    “WMI.”

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and waste-to-energy services. In providing
    these services, we actively pursue projects and initiatives that
    we believe make a positive difference for our environment,
    including recovering and processing the methane gas produced
    naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source. Our
    customers include commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers, other waste management companies,
    electric utilities and governmental entities. During 2007, none
    of our customers accounted for more than 1% of our operating
    revenue. We employed approximately 47,400 people as of
    December 31, 2007.

Strategy

Our Company’s goals are targeted at serving five key
    stakeholders: our customers, our employees, the environment, the
    communities in which we work, and our shareholders. Our goals
    are:

•

To be the waste solutions provider of choice for customers;

•

To be a best place to work for employees;

•

To be a leader in promoting environmental stewardship;

•

To be a trusted and valued community partner; and

•

To maximize shareholder value.

Our strategy, which we believe will enable us to meet these
    goals, remains the same as last year: improve our organization
    and maximize returns to shareholders by focusing on operational
    excellence, pricing excellence and profitably growing our
    business. We continue our efforts toward revenue growth through
    pricing and are continuously working to lower operating and
    selling, general and administrative costs through process
    standardization and productivity improvements. Additionally, we
    have been improving our portfolio of businesses through our
    “fix or seek exit” initiative. All of these measures
    help us to generate strong and consistent cash flows from
    operations that can be used to maximize shareholder value.

As we move forward, we are building on our strategy to meet the
    needs of a changing environment and to make the most of the
    successes we have had so far. As the largest waste services
    provider in North America, we believe we are well positioned to
    meet the needs of the customers and communities we serve as
    they, too, Think
    Green

®

.
    We



believe that doing things that will help our customers achieve
    their environmental goals will help us achieve profitable
    growth. We regularly help customers reduce, reuse and recycle
    the waste they produce. We also focus on what is left, and in
    many cases convert the waste to a usable energy source. By
    focusing on providing new environmentally responsible and
    sustainable solutions to our customers’ waste problems, we
    believe we can create a competitive advantage across all of our
    lines of business.

Our focus on operational excellence has provided us a foundation
    on which to build. We believe we are well positioned to enhance
    that foundation by seeking profitable growth through targeted
    sales efforts and acquisitions. We are seeking to grow our
    current business in a variety of areas, including waste-based
    energy and single-stream recycling. We also are looking at new
    ways to grow. We believe we can make investments that are
    synergistic and that are going to take advantage of what we do
    best to give us revenue and earnings growth.

Operations

General

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through six
    operating Groups, of which four are organized by geographic area
    and two are organized by function. The geographic Groups include
    our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, and the two
    functional Groups are our Wheelabrator Group, which provides
    waste-to-energy services, and our WM Recycle America
    (“WMRA”) Group, which provides recycling services not
    managed by our geographic Groups. We also provide additional
    waste management services that are not managed through our six
    Groups. These services include in-plant services, where we work
    at our clients’ facilities to provide environmental
    management systems and provide opportunities for process
    improvements and associated cost reductions in their waste
    management. Other services not managed within our Groups include
    methane gas recovery and third-party sub-contracted and
    administrative services. These services are presented in this
    report as “Other.”

The table below shows the total revenues (in millions)
    contributed annually by each of our reportable segments in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007. More information
    about our results of operations by reportable segment is
    included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and in the

Collection.

Our commitment to customers begins
    with a vast waste collection network. Collection involves
    picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to
    a transfer station or disposal site. We generally provide
    collection services under one of two types of arrangements:

•

For commercial and industrial collection services, typically we
    have a three-year service agreement. The fees under the
    agreements are influenced by factors such as collection
    frequency, type of collection equipment we furnish, type and
    volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the
    disposal facility, labor costs, cost of disposal and general
    market factors. As part of the service, we provide steel
    containers to most customers to store their solid waste between

pick-up

dates. Containers vary in size and type according to the needs
    of our customers and the restrictions of their communities. Many
    are designed to be lifted mechanically and either emptied into a
    truck’s compaction hopper or directly into a disposal site.
    By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial
    and industrial customers with trucks operated by only one
    employee.

•

For most residential collection services, we have a contract
    with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality,
    homeowners’ association or some other regional authority
    that gives us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of
    the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are
    typically for periods of one to five years. We also provide
    services under individual monthly subscriptions directly to
    households. The fees for residential collection are either paid
    by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or
    service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving
    the service.

Landfill.

Landfills are the main depositories
    for solid waste in North America and we have the largest network
    of landfills in North America. Solid waste landfills are built
    and operated on land with geological and hydrological properties
    that limit the possibility of water pollution, and are operated
    under prescribed procedures. A landfill must be maintained to
    meet federal, state or provincial, and local regulations. The
    operation and closure of a solid waste landfill includes
    excavation, construction of liners, continuous spreading and
    compacting of waste, covering of waste with earth or other inert
    material and constructing final capping of the landfill. These
    operations are carefully planned to maintain sanitary
    conditions, to maximize the use of the airspace and to prepare
    the site so it can ultimately be used for other purposes.

All solid waste management companies must have access to a
    disposal facility, such as a solid waste landfill. We believe it
    is usually preferable for our collection operations to use
    disposal facilities that we own or operate, a practice we refer
    to as internalization, rather than using third-party disposal
    facilities. Internalization generally allows us to realize
    higher consolidated margins and stronger operating cash flows.
    The fees charged at disposal facilities, which are referred to
    as tipping fees, are based on several factors, including
    competition and the type and weight or volume of solid waste
    deposited.

We also operate secure hazardous waste landfills in the United
    States. Under federal environmental laws, the federal government
    (or states with delegated authority) must issue permits for all
    hazardous waste landfills. All of our hazardous waste landfills
    have obtained the required permits, although some can accept
    only certain types of hazardous waste. These landfills must also
    comply with specialized operating standards. Only hazardous
    waste in a



stable, solid form, which meets regulatory requirements, can be
    deposited in our secure disposal cells. In some cases, hazardous
    waste can be treated before disposal. Generally, these
    treatments involve the separation or removal of solid materials
    from liquids and chemical treatments that transform waste into
    inert materials that are no longer hazardous. Our hazardous
    waste landfills are sited, constructed and operated in a manner
    designed to provide long-term containment of waste. We also
    operate a hazardous waste facility at which we isolate treated
    hazardous waste in liquid form by injection into deep wells that
    have been drilled in rock formations far below the base of fresh
    water to a point that is separated by other substantial
    geological confining layers.

We owned or operated 271 solid waste and six hazardous waste
    landfills at December 31, 2007 and we owned or operated 277
    solid waste and six hazardous waste landfills at
    December 31, 2006. The landfills that we operate but do not
    own are generally operated under a lease agreement or an
    operating contract. The differences between the two arrangements
    usually relate to the owner of the landfill operating permit.
    Under lease agreements, the permit typically is in our name and
    we operate the landfill for its entire life, making payments to
    the lessor based either on a percentage of revenue or a rate per
    ton of waste received. We are usually responsible for the
    closure and post-closure obligations of the landfills we lease.
    For operating contracts, the property owner owns the permit and
    we operate the landfill for a contracted term, which may be the
    life of the landfill. The property owner is generally
    responsible for closure and post-closure obligations under our
    operating contracts.

Based on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31,
    2007 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average
    remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated
    landfills is approximately 30 years. Many of our landfills
    have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is
    currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted
    disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether
    to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated
    future waste volumes and prices, remaining capacity and
    likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are currently
    seeking expansion permits at 54 of our landfills for which we
    consider expansions to be likely. Although no assurances can be
    made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted
    as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for
    all owned or operated landfills is approximately 37 years
    when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume. Remaining
    permitted airspace and expansion airspace are defined in the

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

section of this report
    under “— Critical Accounting Estimates and
    Assumptions.” At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    expected remaining capacity in cubic yards and tonnage of waste
    that can be accepted at our owned or operated landfills is shown

(a)

Changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the
    estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes
    in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the
    number of tons that can be placed in the future. Estimates of
    the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are
    reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of
    factors, including standard engineering techniques and
    site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste
    type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of
    years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; and
    anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or
    recirculation of landfill leachate. We continually focus on
    improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that
    include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit;
    optimizing the placement of daily cover materials; and
    increasing initial compaction through improved landfill
    equipment, operations and training.

The number of landfills we own or operate as of
    December 31, 2007, segregated by their estimated operating
    lives (in years), based on remaining permitted and expansion
    airspace and projected annual disposal volume was as follows:

The volume of waste that we received in 2007 was lower than in

(a)

In 2007, we acquired two landfills, sold three landfills, closed
    four landfills and discontinued operations at one operating
    contract site.

(b)

These amounts include 2.4 million tons at December 31,
    2007 and 2.0 million tons at December 31, 2006 that
    were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial
    purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted
    airspace to other areas of the landfill. Waste types that are
    frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for
    composting and clean dirt for

on-site

construction projects.

When a landfill we own or operate (i) reaches its permitted
    waste capacity; (ii) is permanently capped; and
    (iii) receives certification of closure from the applicable
    regulatory agency, management of the site, including remediation
    activities, is generally transferred to our closed sites
    management group. In addition to the 277 active landfills we
    managed at December 31, 2007, we managed 187 closed
    landfills.

Transfer.

At December 31, 2007, we owned
    or operated 341 transfer stations in North America. We deposit
    waste at these stations, as do other waste haulers. The solid
    waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume
    and increase the density of the waste and transported by
    transfer trucks or by rail to disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is often critical to third-party
    haulers who do not operate their own disposal facilities in
    close proximity to their collection operations. Fees charged to
    third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type
    and volume or weight of the waste transferred, the distance to
    the disposal site and general market factors.

The utilization of our transfer stations by our own collection
    operations improves internalization by allowing us to retain
    fees that we would otherwise pay to third parties for the
    disposal of the waste we collect. It allows us to manage costs
    associated with waste disposal because (i) transfer trucks,
    railcars or rail containers have larger capacities than
    collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more waste to the
    disposal facility in each trip; (ii) waste is accumulated
    and compacted at transfer stations that are strategically
    located to increase the efficiency of our collection operations;
    and (iii) we can retain the volume by managing the transfer
    of the waste to one of our own disposal sites.

The transfer stations that we operate but do not own are
    generally operated through lease agreements under which we lease
    property from third parties. There are some instances where
    transfer stations are operated under contract, generally for
    municipalities. In most cases we own the permits and will be
    responsible for the regulatory requirements relating to the
    operation, closure and post closure of the transfer station.

Wheelabrator.

As of December 31, 2007, we
    owned or operated 16 waste-to-energy facilities and five
    independent power production plants, or IPPs, that are located
    in the Northeast and in Florida, California and Washington.

At our waste-to-energy facilities, solid waste is burned at high
    temperatures in specially designed boilers to produce heat that
    is converted into high-pressure steam. As of December 31,
    2007, our waste-to-energy facilities were capable of processing
    up to 21,000 tons of solid waste each day, a decrease in
    capacity of approximately 3,000 tons per day from
    December 31, 2006. In 2007, our waste-to-energy facilities
    received and processed 7.1 million tons of solid waste, or
    approximately 19,500 tons per day. In 2006, our waste-to-energy
    facilities received and processed 7.8 million tons of solid
    waste, or approximately 21,300 tons per day. The decline in both
    the capacity and production of our waste-to-energy facilities
    during 2007 was due to the termination of an operating and
    maintenance agreement in May 2007.

Our IPPs convert various waste and conventional fuels into
    steam. The plants burn wood waste, anthracite coal waste (culm),
    tires, landfill gas and natural gas. These facilities are
    integral to the solid waste industry, disposing of urban wood,
    waste tires, railroad ties and utility poles. Our anthracite
    culm facility in Pennsylvania processes the waste materials left
    over from coal mining operations from over half a century ago.
    Ash remaining after burning the culm is used to reclaim the land
    damaged by decades of coal mining.

We sell the steam produced at our waste-to-energy facilities and
    IPPs to industrial and commercial users. Steam that is not sold
    is used to generate electricity for sale to electric utilities.
    Fees charged for steam and electricity at our waste-to-energy
    facilities and IPPs are generally subject to the terms and
    conditions of long-term contracts that include interim
    adjustments to the prices charged for changes in market
    conditions such as inflation, natural gas prices and other
    general market factors.



Recycling.

Our WMRA Group focuses on improving
    the sustainability and future growth of recycling programs
    within communities and industries. In addition to our WMRA
    Group, our four geographic operating Groups provide certain
    recycling services that are embedded within the Groups’
    other operations and, therefore, are not included within the
    WMRA Group’s financial results.

Recycling involves the separation of reusable materials from the
    waste stream for processing and resale or other disposition. Our
    recycling operations include the following:

Collection and materials processing

— Through
    our collection operations, we collect recyclable materials from
    residential, commercial and industrial customers and direct
    these materials to one of our material recovery facilities
    (“MRFs”) for processing. We operate 99 MRFs where
    paper, glass, metals and plastics are recovered for resale. We
    also operate six secondary processing facilities where materials
    received from MRFs can be further processed into raw products
    used in the manufacturing of consumer goods. Specifically,
    material processing services include data destruction, automated
    color sorting, and construction and demolition processing.

Plastics and rubber materials recycling

— Using
    state-of-the-art sorting and processing technology, we process,
    inventory and sell plastic and rubber commodities making the
    recycling of such items more cost effective and convenient.

Electronics recycling services

— We provide an
    innovative, customized approach to recycling discarded
    computers, communications equipment, and other electronic
    equipment. Services include the collection, sorting and
    disassembling of electronics in an effort to reuse or recycle
    all collected materials.

Commodities recycling

— We market and resell
    recyclable commodities to customers world-wide. We manage the
    marketing of recyclable commodities for our own facilities and
    for third parties by maintaining comprehensive service centers
    that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market
    demands and product quality.

During 2006, we also provided glass recycling services. However,
    we divested of our glass recycling facilities in 2006 as part of
    our continued focus on improving the profitability of our
    business.

Fees for recycling services are influenced by frequency of
    collection, type and volume or weight of the recyclable
    material, degree of processing required, the market value of the
    recovered material and other market factors.

Our WMRA Group purchases recyclable materials processed in our
    MRFs from various sources, including third parties and other
    operating subsidiaries of WMI. The cost per ton of material
    purchased is based on market prices and the cost to transport
    the finished goods to our customers. The price our WMRA Group
    pays for recyclable materials is often referred to as a
    “rebate” and is based upon the price we receive for
    sales of finished goods and local market conditions. As a
    result, higher commodity prices increase our revenues and
    increase the rebates we pay to our suppliers.

Other.

We provide in-plant services, in which
    employees of our Upstream organization work full-time inside our
    customers’ facilities to provide full-service waste
    management solutions. Our vertically integrated waste management
    operations allow us to provide customers with full management of
    their waste, including identifying recycling opportunities,
    minimizing waste, and determining the most efficient means
    available for waste collection and disposal.

We also develop, operate and promote projects for the beneficial
    use of landfill gas through our Waste Management Renewable
    Energy Program. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste
    decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill
    gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be
    gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel.
    The United States Environmental Protection Agency endorses
    landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, in the same
    category as wind, solar and geothermal resources. At
    December 31, 2007, landfill gas beneficial use projects
    were producing commercial quantities of methane gas at 108 of
    our solid waste landfills. At 80 of these landfills, the
    processed gas is delivered to electricity generators. The
    electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal
    utilities or power cooperatives. At 21 landfills, the gas
    is delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct
    substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. At seven
    landfills, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline-quality
    natural gas and then sold to natural gas suppliers.



In addition, we rent and service portable restroom facilities to
    municipalities and commercial customers under the name
    Port-O-Let

®

,
    and provide street and parking lot sweeping services. We also
    have begun providing portable self-storage and fluorescent lamp
    recycling services. From time to time, we are also contracted to
    construct waste facilities on behalf of third parties.

Competition

The solid waste industry is very competitive. Competition comes
    from a number of publicly held solid waste companies, private
    solid waste companies, large commercial and industrial companies
    handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and
    public and private waste-to-energy companies. We also have
    competition from municipalities and regional government
    authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid
    waste collection and solid waste landfills. The municipalities
    and regional governmental authorities are often able to offer
    lower direct charges to customers for the same service by
    subsidizing their costs through the use of tax revenues and
    tax-exempt financing. Generally, however, municipalities do not
    provide significant commercial and industrial collection or
    waste disposal.

We compete for disposal business on the basis of tipping fees,
    geographic location and quality of operations. Our ability to
    obtain disposal business may be limited in areas where other
    companies own or operate their own landfills, to which they will
    send their waste. We compete for collection accounts primarily
    on the basis of price and quality of services. Operating costs,
    disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the
    geographic areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge
    are determined locally, and typically vary by the volume and
    weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of
    handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to
    final disposal sites, the availability of airspace within the
    geographic region, labor costs and amount and type of equipment
    furnished to the customer. We face intense competition based on
    pricing and quality of service. Under certain customer service
    contracts, our ability to increase our prices or pass on cost
    increases to our customers may be limited. From time to time,
    competitors may reduce the price of their services and accept
    lower margins in an effort to expand or maintain market share or
    to successfully obtain competitively bid contracts.

Employees

At December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    47,400 full-time employees, of which approximately 7,900
    were employed in administrative and sales positions and the
    balance in operations. Approximately 11,700 of our employees are
    covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Financial
    Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial
    Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally
    require contracting parties to demonstrate financial
    responsibility for their obligations under the contract.
    Financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or
    retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits.
    Various forms of financial assurance are also required by
    regulatory agencies for estimated closure, post-closure and
    remedial obligations at many of our landfills. In addition,
    certain of our tax-exempt borrowings require us to hold funds in
    trust for the repayment of our interest and principal
    obligations.



We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of
    credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and
    financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on
    several factors; most importantly the jurisdiction, contractual
    requirements, market factors and availability of credit
    capacity. The following table summarizes the various forms and
    dollar amounts (in millions) of financial assurance that we had
    outstanding as of December 31, 2007:

(g)

WMI provides financial guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries
    to municipalities, customers and regulatory authorities. They
    are provided primarily to support our performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure activities.

The assets held in our funded trust and escrow accounts may be
    drawn and used to meet the obligations for which the trusts and
    escrows were established. Other than these permitted draws on
    funds, virtually no claims have been made against our financial
    assurance instruments in the past, and considering our current
    financial position, management does not expect there to be
    claims against these instruments that will have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. In an
    ongoing effort to mitigate the risks of future cost increases
    and reductions in available capacity, we are continually
    evaluating various options to access cost-effective sources of
    financial assurance.

Insurance

We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general
    liability, automobile liability, real and personal property,
    workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’
    liability, pollution legal liability and other coverages we
    believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for
    insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident
    deductible under the related insurance policy. Our general
    liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance
    programs have per incident deductibles of $2.5 million,
    $1.5 million and $1 million, respectively. Effective
    January 1, 2008, we increased the per incident deductible
    for our workers’ compensation insurance program to
    $5 million. We do not expect the impact of any known
    casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a
    material impact on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows. Our estimated insurance liabilities as
    of December 31, 2007 are summarized in Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state
    or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and
    transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
    are administered by the EPA and various other federal, state and
    local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health
    and safety agencies in the United States and various agencies in
    Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations
    to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have
    the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose
    civil or criminal penalties in case of violations.

Because the major component of our business is the collection
    and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner,
    a significant amount of our capital expenditures is related,
    either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection
    measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial
    and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials
    into the environment. There are costs associated with siting,
    design, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective
    actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and
    post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition,
    development or expansion of a disposal facility or transfer
    station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money
    to obtain or maintain necessary required permits and approvals.
    There cannot be any assurances that we will be able to obtain or
    maintain necessary governmental approvals. Once obtained,
    operating permits are subject to modification, suspension or
    revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with these and any
    future regulatory requirements could require us to make
    significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of
    these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and
    do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.

The primary United States federal statutes affecting our
    business are summarized below:

•

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended,
    regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and
    non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop
    programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991,
    the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA,
    which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria
    for solid waste landfills. These regulations must be implemented
    by the states, although states can impose requirements that are
    more stringent than the Subtitle D standards. We incur costs in
    complying with these standards in the ordinary course of our
    operations.

•

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which is also known as
    Superfund, provides for federal authority to respond directly to
    releases or threatened



releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have
    created actual or potential environmental hazards. CERCLA’s
    primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict
    liability for cleanup of disposal sites upon current and former
    site owners and operators, generators of the hazardous
    substances at the site and transporters who selected the
    disposal site and transported substances thereto. Liability
    under CERCLA is not dependent on the intentional disposal of
    hazardous substances; it can be based upon the release or
    threatened release, even as a result of lawful, unintentional
    and non-negligent action, of hazardous substances as the term is
    defined by CERCLA and other applicable statutes and regulations.
    Liability may include contribution for cleanup costs incurred by
    a defendant in a CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has
    previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators
    in an administrative or judicially approved settlement.
    Liability could also include liability to a PRP that voluntarily
    expends site

clean-up

costs. Further, liability may include damage to publicly owned
    natural resources. We are subject to potential liability under
    CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous
    substances have been disposed or as a generator or transporter
    of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations.

•

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, known as the
    Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into
    streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a
    variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites. If
    run-off from our operations may be discharged into surface
    waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain
    discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under
    certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in
    those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards
    for management of storm water runoff from landfills that require
    landfills to obtain storm water discharge permits. In addition,
    if a landfill or a transfer station discharges wastewater
    through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works, the
    facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the
    treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a
    landfill can alter or affect “wetlands,” a permit may
    have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement
    wetlands. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and
    administrative penalties for violations of its provisions.

•

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, provides for increased
    federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air
    pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the
    requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large municipal
    solid waste landfills and large municipal waste-to-energy
    facilities. Standards have also been imposed on manufacturers of
    transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles).
    In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards and
    emission guidelines controlling landfill gases from new and
    existing large landfills. The regulations impose limits on air
    emissions from large municipal solid waste landfills, subject
    most of our large municipal solid waste landfills to certain
    operating permitting requirements under Title V of the
    Clean Air Act, and, in many instances, require installation of
    landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions
    or to treat and utilize landfill gas on or off-site. In general,
    controlling emissions involves drilling collection wells into a
    landfill and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery
    system or combustion device. We are currently capturing and
    utilizing the renewable energy value of landfill gas at 108 of
    our solid waste landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued
    additional regulations that required affected landfills to
    prepare, by January 2004, startup, shutdown and malfunction
    plans to ensure proper operation of gas collection, control and
    treatment systems.

The EPA has issued new source performance standards and emission
    guidelines for large and small municipal waste-to-energy
    facilities, which include stringent emission limits for various
    pollutants based on Maximum Achievable Control Technology
    standards. These sources are also subject to operating permit
    requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The Clean
    Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards
    applicable to municipal waste-to-energy facilities every five
    years.

•

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended,
    establishes certain employer responsibilities, including
    maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to
    cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards
    promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, and various reporting and record keeping
    obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements.
    Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation
    and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to
    our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along
    with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain
    aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including
    safety, movement and disposal . Various state and local agencies
    with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous



waste may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in
    areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

There are also various state or provincial and local regulations
    that affect our operations. Sometimes states’ regulations
    are stricter than federal laws and regulations when not
    otherwise preempted by federal law. Additionally, our collection
    and landfill operations could be affected by legislative and
    regulatory measures requiring or encouraging waste reduction at
    the source and waste recycling.

Various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws
    that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste
    generated outside the state. While laws that overtly
    discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be
    unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory
    have been upheld in court. Additionally, certain state and local
    governments have enacted “flow control” regulations,
    which attempt to require that all waste generated within the
    state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In
    1994, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a flow control
    ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was
    privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007 the Court
    ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by
    the local government was constitutional. In addition, from time
    to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation
    authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes
    on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste.
    The United States Congress’ adoption of legislation
    allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of
    out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of
    flow control or the adoption of legislation affecting interstate
    transportation of waste at the state level could adversely
    affect our operations. Courts’ interpretation of flow
    control legislation or the Supreme Court decisions also could
    adversely affect our solid waste management services.

Many states, provinces and local jurisdictions have enacted
    “fitness” laws that allow the agencies that have
    jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or
    revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant or
    permit holder’s compliance history. Some states, provinces
    and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance
    history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in
    addition to the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize
    the agencies to make determinations of an applicant or permit
    holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate, and
    to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness,
    unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder
    has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating
    policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance
    with applicable laws and regulations.

See Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for disclosures relating to our current assessments of the
    impact of regulations on our current and future operations.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In an effort to keep our shareholders and the public informed
    about our business, we may make “forward-looking
    statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to
    future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or
    other aspects of our operations or operating results.
    Forward-looking statements generally include statements
    containing:

•

projections about accounting and finances;

•

plans and objectives for the future;

•

projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our
    performance; and

•

our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or
    future events, circumstances or performance.

You should view these statements with caution. These statements
    are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or
    events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as
    of the date the statements are made. All phases of our business
    are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many
    of which we do not control. Any of these factors, either alone
    or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us
    and could change whether any forward-looking statement
    ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no
    obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result
    of future events, circumstances or developments. The following
    discussion should be read together with the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the notes thereto. Outlined below are
    some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and
    financial statements for 2008 and beyond. These are not the only
    risks that we face. There may be other risks that we do not
    presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that
    could also impair our business and financial position.



The
    waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot
    successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial
    condition and operating results may be materially adversely
    affected.

We encounter intense competition from governmental,
    quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our
    operations. In North America, the industry consists of large
    national waste management companies, and local and regional
    companies of varying sizes and financial resources. We compete
    with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities
    that maintain their own waste collection and disposal
    operations. These counties and municipalities may have financial
    competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to
    them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them.
    Also, such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control
    or other restrictions that would give them a competitive
    advantage.

In addition, competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales
    volume or to win competitively bid contracts. When this happens,
    we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or
    retain our customers, resulting in a negative impact to our
    revenue growth from yield on base business.

If we
    do not successfully manage our costs, our income from operations
    could be lower than expected.

In recent years, we have implemented several profit improvement
    initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our
    revenues, and we continue to seek ways to reduce our selling,
    general and administrative and operating expenses. While
    generally we have been successful in managing our costs,
    including subcontractor costs and the effect of fuel price
    increases, our initiatives may not be sufficient. Even as our
    revenues increase, if we are unable to control variable costs or
    increases to our fixed costs in the future, we will be unable to
    maintain or expand our margins.

We
    cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement
    our plans and strategies to improve margins and increase our
    income from operations.

We have announced several programs and strategies that we have
    implemented or planned to improve our margins and operating
    results. For example, except when prohibited by contract, we
    have implemented price increases and environmental fees, and we
    continue our fuel surcharge programs, all of which have
    increased our internal revenue growth. The loss of volumes as a
    result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows
    or results of operations. Additionally, we continue to seek to
    divest under-performing and non-strategic assets if we cannot
    improve their profitability. We may not be able to successfully
    negotiate the divestiture of under-performing and non-strategic
    operations, which could result in asset impairments or the
    continued operation of low-margin businesses. If we are not able
    to fully implement our plans for any reason, many of which are
    out of our control, we may not see the expected improvements in
    our income from operations or our operating margins.

The
    seasonal nature of our business and changes in general and local
    economic conditions cause our quarterly results to fluctuate,
    and prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our
    future results.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
    during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
    and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
    trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
    that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
    the hurricanes experienced during 2004 and 2005, actually
    increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for
    several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
    Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
    months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities.

Our business is affected by changes in national and general
    economic factors that are also outside of our control, including
    interest rates and consumer confidence. We have
    $2.9 billion of debt as of December 31, 2007 that is
    exposed to changes in market interest rates because of the
    combined impact of our variable rate tax-exempt bonds and our
    interest rate swap agreements. Therefore, any increase in
    interest rates can significantly increase our expenses.
    Additionally, although our services are of an essential nature,
    a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of
    waste generated, which decreases our revenues. We also face
    risks related to other adverse



external factors, such as the ability of our insurers to meet
    their commitments in a timely manner and the effect that
    significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may
    have on such ability.

Any of the factors described above could materially adversely
    affect our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally,
    due to these and other factors, operating results in any interim
    period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
    an entire year, and operating results for any historical period
    are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future
    period.

We
    cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under
    environmental, health and safety laws, and cannot guarantee that
    they will not be material.

We could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage
    to our properties or to the property of other landowners,
    particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking
    water or soil. Under current law, we could even be held liable
    for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
    the assets or operations involved. Also, we could be liable if
    we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of
    hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or
    if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under
    applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner.
    Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, and
    may in the future, become involved in a variety of legal and
    administrative proceedings relating to land use and
    environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in
    which:

•

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to
    impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes
    involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to
    revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and

•

local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or
    governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or
    approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which
    we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or
    seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons
    involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If
    we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of
    these proceedings could result in, among other things, material
    increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material
    charges for asset impairments.

The
    waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation,
    and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations,
    increase our costs of operations or require us to make
    additional capital expenditures.

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
    provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have
    a substantial impact on our business. A large number of complex
    laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental
    protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and
    related matters. Among other things, they may restrict our
    operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

•

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal,
    transfer or processing facilities or expanding existing
    facilities;

•

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal
    prices, rates and volumes;

•

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of
    out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; or

•

mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of
    landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or
    remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills
    temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations
    may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or
    facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could
    be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste
    management facility, we must have various facility permits and
    other governmental approvals, including those relating to
    zoning, environmental protection and



land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time
    consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that
    limit our operations.

Governmental
    authorities may enact climate change regulations that could
    increase our costs to operate.

Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the
    United States have been focusing considerable attention on the
    emissions of greenhouse gases and their potential role in
    climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to
    implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition
    of fees or taxes, could adversely affect our collection and
    disposal operations. Additionally, certain of the states in
    which we operate are contemplating air pollution control
    regulations that are more stringent than existing and proposed
    federal regulations. Changing environmental regulations could
    require us to take any number of actions, including the purchase
    of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution
    control technology, and could make some operations less
    profitable, which could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

Significant
    shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will
    increase our operating expenses.

The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable, and can
    fluctuate significantly based on international, political and
    economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our
    control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum
    Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers,
    regional production patterns, weather conditions and
    environmental concerns. In the past two years, the
    year-over-year changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have
    ranged from an increase of 28% to a decrease of 5%. We need fuel
    to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in
    our landfill operations. Supply shortages could substantially
    increase our operating expenses. Additionally, as fuel prices
    increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our
    vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising
    costs. We have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to
    offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to
    pass through all of our increased costs and some customers’
    contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs. We
    may initiate other programs or means to guard against the rising
    costs of fuel, although there can be no assurances that we will
    be able to do so or that such programs will be successful.
    Regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, the increased
    operating costs will decrease our operating margins.

We
    have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements,
    and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
    assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could
    negatively impact our liquidity and increase our
    liabilities.

The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for
    environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements.
    We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to
    the coverage it would provide, and therefore, our coverages are
    generally maintained at the minimum statutorily required levels.
    We face the risk of incurring liabilities for environmental
    damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to
    cover those damages. We also carry a broad range of insurance
    coverages that are customary for a company our size. We use
    these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby allowing us to
    manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. To
    the extent our insurers were unable to meet their obligations,
    or our own obligations for claims were more than we estimated,
    there could be a material adverse effect to our financial
    results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with
    respect to environmental closure and post-closure liabilities,
    we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on
    insurance, including captive insurance, or fund trust and escrow
    accounts. We currently have in place all financial assurance
    instruments necessary for our operations. We do not anticipate
    any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining financial assurance
    instruments in the future. However, in the event we are unable
    to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or
    third-party insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or
    more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate
    coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial
    assurance. These types of financial assurance could be more
    expensive to obtain, which could negatively impact our liquidity
    and capital resources and our ability to meet our obligations as
    they become due.

The
    possibility of development and expansion projects or pending
    acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could
    result in a material charge against our earnings.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we
    capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to
    disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions,
    software development costs and other



projects. If a facility or operation is permanently shut down or
    determined to be impaired, a pending acquisition is not
    completed, a development or expansion project is not completed
    or is determined to be impaired, we will charge against earnings
    any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating
    to such facility, acquisition or project. We reduce the charge
    against earnings by any portion of the capitalized costs that we
    estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise.

In future periods, we may be required to incur charges against
    earnings in accordance with this policy, or due to other events
    that cause impairments. Any such charges could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our
    revenues will fluctuate based on changes in commodity
    prices.

Our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable
    materials, including fibers, aluminum and glass, all of which
    are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The
    majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper
    fibers, including old corrugated cardboard, known as OCC, and
    old newsprint, or ONP. In the past two years, the year-over-year
    changes in the quarterly average market prices for OCC ranged
    from a decrease of as much as 34% to an increase of as much as
    83%. The same comparisons for ONP have ranged from a decrease of
    as much as 16% to an increase of as much as 47%. These
    fluctuations can affect future operating income and cash flows.
    Additionally, our recycling operations offer rebates to
    suppliers, based on the market prices of commodities we buy to
    process for resale. Therefore, even if we experience higher
    revenues based on increased market prices for commodities, the
    rebates we pay will also increase.

Additionally, there may be significant price fluctuations in the
    price of methane gas, electricity and other energy related
    products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas
    recovery, waste-to-energy and independent power production plant
    operations. The marketing and sales of energy related products
    by our landfill gas and waste-to-energy operations are generally
    pursuant to long-term sales agreements. Therefore, market
    fluctuations do not have a significant effect on these
    operations in the short-term. However, as those agreements
    expire and are up for renewal, changes in market prices may
    affect our revenues. Additionally, revenues from our independent
    power production plants can be affected by price fluctuations.
    In the past two years, the year-over-year changes in the average
    quarterly electricity prices have increased or decreased by as
    much as 5%.

The
    development and acceptance of alternatives to landfill disposal
    and waste-to-energy facilities could reduce our ability to
    operate at full capacity.

Our customers are increasingly using alternatives to landfill
    and waste-to-energy disposal, such as recycling and composting.
    In addition, some state and local governments mandate recycling
    and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of
    certain types of waste, such as yard waste, at landfills or
    waste-to-energy facilities. Although such mandates are a useful
    tool to protect our environment, these developments reduce the
    volume of waste going to landfills and waste-to-energy
    facilities in certain areas, which may affect our ability to
    operate our landfills and waste-to-energy facilities at full
    capacity, as well as the prices that we can charge for landfill
    disposal and waste-to-energy services.

Efforts
    by labor unions to organize our employees could increase our
    operating expenses.

Labor unions constantly make attempts to organize our employees,
    and these efforts will likely continue in the future. Certain
    groups of our employees have already chosen to be represented by
    unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements
    with some of the groups. Additional groups of employees may seek
    union representation in the future, and, if successful, the
    negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert
    management attention and result in increased operating expenses
    and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable
    collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages, including
    strikes, could ensue. Depending on the type and duration of any
    labor disruptions, our operating expenses could increase
    significantly, which could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Currently
    pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could
    result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or
    settlements.

We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of
    our business and from time-to-time are involved in governmental
    proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. The timing
    of the final resolutions to these types



of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible
    outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse
    judgments or settlements, either of which could require
    substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.

We are
    increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if
    our technology fails, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We may experience problems with either the operation of our
    current information technology systems or the development and
    deployment of new information technology systems that could
    adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion
    of our operations until resolved. We encountered problems with
    the new revenue management application that we had been piloting
    throughout 2007, resulting in the termination of the pilot while
    we determine how to proceed on an enterprise-wide basis. The
    termination of the pilot may lead to additional costs and
    expenses, which could be material. Additionally, the delay in
    implementing a new, enterprise-wide revenue management system
    may negatively affect our ability to improve our operating
    margins. Finally, there can be no assurances that our issues
    related to the licensed application will not ultimately result
    in an impairment charge, which could be material.

Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to
    timely collect and report financial results in accordance with
    applicable law and regulations.

We may
    experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations
    as a result of adopting new accounting standards or
    interpretations.

Our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting
    rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could
    adversely affect our reported operating results or cause
    unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in
    future periods.

Unforeseen
    circumstances could result in a need for additional
    capital.

We currently expect to meet our anticipated cash needs for
    capital expenditures, acquisitions and other cash expenditures
    with our cash flows from operations and, to the extent
    necessary, additional financings. However, materially adverse
    events could reduce our cash flows from operations. Our Board of
    Directors has approved a capital allocation program that
    provides for up to $1.4 billion in aggregate dividend
    payments and share repurchases during 2008 and recently
    announced that it expects future quarterly dividend payments,
    when declared by the Board of Directors, to be $0.27 per share.
    If our cash flows from operations were negatively affected, we
    could be forced to reduce capital expenditures, acquisition
    activity, share repurchase activity or dividend declarations. In
    these circumstances we instead may elect to incur more
    indebtedness. If we made such an election, there can be no
    assurances that we would be able to obtain additional financings
    on acceptable terms. In these circumstances, we would likely use
    our revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs.

In the event of a default under our credit facility, we could be
    required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and
    make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the
    facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Additionally,
    any such default could cause a default under many of our other
    credit agreements and debt instruments. Any such default would
    have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas, where we
    lease approximately 390,000 square feet under leases
    expiring at various times through 2010. Our operating Group
    offices are in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Georgia, Arizona, New
    Hampshire and Texas. We also have field-based administrative
    offices in Arizona, Illinois and Canada. We own or lease real
    property in most locations where we have operations. We have
    operations in each of the fifty states other than Montana and
    Wyoming. We also have operations in the District of Columbia,
    Puerto Rico and throughout Canada.

Our principal property and equipment consist of land (primarily
    landfills and other disposal facilities, transfer stations and
    bases for collection operations), buildings, vehicles and
    equipment. We believe that our vehicles,



equipment, and operating properties are adequately maintained
    and sufficient for our current operations. However, we expect to
    continue to make investments in additional equipment and
    property for expansion, for replacement of assets, and in
    connection with future acquisitions. For more information, see

In October 2004, the Company announced that its Board of
    Directors approved a capital allocation program authorizing up
    to $1.2 billion of stock repurchases and dividend payments
    annually for each of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Under this program, we
    paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.20 per share for a total of
    $449 million in 2005; $0.22 per share for a total of
    $476 million in 2006; and $0.24 per share for a total of
    $495 million in 2007.

In March 2007, our Board of Directors approved up to
    $600 million of additional share repurchases for 2007, and
    in November 2007 approved up to $300 million of additional
    share repurchases, increasing the amount of capital authorized
    for our share repurchases and dividends for 2007 to
    $2.1 billion. In 2007, we repurchased approximately
    40 million shares of our common stock for
    $1,421 million. All of the repurchases were made pursuant
    to our capital allocation program. The following table

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

This section includes a discussion of our operations for the
    three years ended December 31, 2007. This discussion may
    contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based
    on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. We
    discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual
    results to differ from expectations in Item 1A,

Risk
    Factors

. The following discussion should be read in light of
    that disclosure and together with the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Overview

Our pricing program, cost control measures and fix-or-seek exit
    initiatives continued to provide earnings growth, margin
    expansion, and strong free cash flow in 2007. Despite volume
    losses resulting from pricing competition and an economic
    softening, particularly in the residential construction sector,
    our 2007 operating results were strong.

We improved our income from operations in 2007 by
    $225 million, or 11%, as compared with 2006. In addition,
    income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased by
    1.7 percentage points in 2007 as compared with 2006. This
    earnings growth and margin expansion is a reflection of our
    continued focus on improving our cost structure and pricing each
    customer to provide profitable returns, as well as significant
    returns provided by our recycling operations in 2007, largely
    due to a very strong market for recycling commodities.

Our revenues in 2007 decreased by $53 million, or 0.4%, as
    compared with 2006, primarily as a result of volume declines and
    divestitures, offset largely by increased yield from base
    business and higher recycling commodity prices. The loss of
    revenue due to volume declines in 2007 has resulted primarily
    from pricing competition and a significant slowdown in
    residential construction across the United States.

In 2007, we decreased our operating expenses despite incurring
    $35 million in operating costs during the year for labor
    disputes in Oakland and Los Angeles, California. In 2007,
    operating expenses decreased by $185 million, or 2.2%, and
    as a percentage of revenue, declined by 1.2 percentage
    points as compared with 2006. Our selling, general and
    administrative expenses increased by $44 million, or 3.2%,
    as compared with 2006, primarily a result of higher costs
    associated with the implementation and execution of our
    strategic initiatives that we believe will improve operations
    and processes over the long-term.



Our free cash flow increased in 2007 due to lower capital
    spending and increased proceeds from divestitures, the effects
    of which were partially offset by lower net cash provided by
    operating activities. Our capital expenditures were less in 2007
    than 2006 largely due to relatively high levels of fleet capital
    spending in 2006 to prepare for significant mandated changes in
    heavy-duty truck engines that began in January 2007. The
    increase in proceeds from divestitures was a result of our
    continued fix-or-seek exit initiative. We calculate free cash
    flow as shown in the table below (in millions):

We have included free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of
    liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the
    evaluation and management of our business and believe it is
    indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends,
    repurchase our common stock and fund acquisitions and other
    investments. Free cash flow is not intended to replace the GAAP
    measure of “Net cash provided by operating
    activities,” which is the most comparable GAAP measure.
    However, by subtracting cash used for capital expenditures and
    adding the cash proceeds from divestitures and other asset
    sales, we believe free cash flow gives investors greater insight
    into our liquidity.

We expect that in 2008 we may continue to face challenges
    related to volume losses as a result of general economic
    conditions and pricing competition. However, we are redirecting
    some of the focus in our sales department from the right-pricing
    of existing customers, which has largely been completed, to
    seeking out new customers that will provide profitable growth to
    our business. Throughout 2007, we continued to focus on building
    a trusted brand that stands for quality, reliable service,
    safety and environmental protection. We plan to cultivate this
    reputation; focus on quality customer service; actively manage
    our capital requirements and scheduled debt repayments; and grow
    our business with targeted acquisitions and other investments
    that will improve our current operations’ performance and
    enhance and expand our services. We believe all of these
    measures will ensure our ability to return value to our
    shareholders.

Technology Update — For the last several years, we
    have been introducing systems and technologies to improve our
    business processes and profitability. We recently have
    successfully deployed our FastLane system, an enterprise-wide,
    automated point-of-sale system for management of scale house
    ticketing and our Compass system, a fleet maintenance system
    that automates many shop functions and tracks repairs. We also
    are proceeding with pilots of onboard computer systems for our
    fleet collection operations and modules for our pricing program.
    As part of our focus on technology, in October 2005, we entered
    into agreements with a major software vendor to license its
    waste and recycling revenue management application and have the
    vendor implement the licensed software throughout the Company on
    a fixed price basis. In January 2007, we began a pilot test of
    the licensed application in one of our smaller market areas,
    while the rest of our market areas continued to operate using
    our existing revenue management system. The results of the pilot
    demonstrated to us that the licensed application would not work.
    In the fourth quarter of 2007, we terminated the pilot and the
    pilot market area’s operations are being returned to our
    existing revenue management system. Although we have continued
    to press the vendor to provide a revenue management application
    that fulfills its obligations to the Company, our negotiations
    have not yet resulted in a satisfactory commitment from the
    vendor. In March 2008, in an effort to avoid litigation, we will
    mediate and attempt to resolve our disputes with the vendor.
    Therefore, we will not be able to deploy a new revenue
    management system in the foreseeable future and we will continue
    to run our current system, although it does not provide the
    benefits we were expecting to get from the licensed application.
    However, we may be able to make enhancements to our current
    system. Our plans to install a new revenue management system, to
    make enhancements to our current system and to address the
    issues with the software vendor may result in cost increases,
    each of which could negatively affect our future cash flow and
    earnings.

Accounting Changes — FIN 48, Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109) and FSP

No. 48-1,

Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48 —

Effective January 1, 2007, we
    adopted FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1.

FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
    attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. In
    addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the de-recognition,
    classification and disclosure of tax positions, as well as the
    accounting for related interest and penalties. FSP

No. 48-1

provides guidance associated with the criteria that must be
    evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively
    settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit.

SFAS No. 123(R) — Share-Based
    Payment

— On January 1, 2006, we adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

, which requires compensation expense to be
    recognized for all share-based payments made to employees based
    on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. We adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method,
    which results in (i) the recognition of compensation
    expense using the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) for
    all share-based awards granted or modified after
    December 31, 2005 and (ii) the recognition of
    compensation expense using the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

for all unvested awards outstanding at the date
    of adoption.

Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information related to the impact of the
    implementation of these new accounting pronouncements on our
    results of operations and financial position.

Reclassification of Segment Information

— In
    the first quarter of 2007, we realigned our Eastern, Midwest and
    Western Group organizations to facilitate improved business
    execution. We moved certain market areas in the Eastern and
    Midwest Groups to the Midwest and Western Groups, respectively.
    In addition, in early 2007 we moved certain of our WMRA
    operations to our Western Group to more closely align their
    recycling operations with the related collection, transfer and
    disposal operations. We have reflected the impact of these
    realignments for all periods presented to provide financial
    information that consistently reflects our current approach to
    managing our operations.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
    with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting
    for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset
    impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as
    described below. Actual results could differ materially from the
    estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our
    financial statements.

Landfills

— The cost estimates for final
    capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for
    which we have responsibility are estimated based on our
    interpretations of current requirements and proposed or
    anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional
    costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143,
    based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform
    such activities even when we expect to perform these activities
    internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to
    each final capping event and the timing of each final capping
    event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because
    landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are
    measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques,
    changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping
    and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on
    these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.

Landfill Costs

— We estimate the total cost to
    develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as
    landfill liner material and installation, excavation for
    airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest,

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs.
    Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases
    for landfill



footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection
    of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events.
    The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs
    to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion
    capacity and includes amounts previously expended and
    capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and
    projections of future purchase and development costs.

Final Capping Costs

— We estimate the cost for
    each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped
    and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates
    also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor
    in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel
    allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping
    events. The landfill capacity associated with each final capping
    event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each
    event are amortized over the related capacity associated with
    the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review
    these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change.
    Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction,
    for final capping events immediately impact the required
    liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in
    estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to
    the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. When
    the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has
    not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is
    recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill
    airspace amortization.

Closure and Post-Closure Costs

— We base our
    estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our
    interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for
    closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The
    estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also
    consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in
    inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal
    and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of
    these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less
    certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure
    events immediately impact the required liability and the
    corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a
    fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be
    amortized immediately through expense. When the change in
    estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully
    consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income
    prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

Expansion Airspace

— We include currently
    unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include
    airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally
    expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted
    within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received
    within five years. Second, we must believe the success of
    obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the
    following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a



specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion
    must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that
    includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by
    the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly
    basis. Of the 54 landfill sites with expansions at
    December 31, 2007, 18 landfills required the Chief
    Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted
    airspace. Eight of these landfills required approval by the
    Chief Financial Officer because of a lack of community or
    political support that could impede the expansion process. The
    remaining ten landfills required approval primarily due to the
    permit application processes not meeting the one- or five-year
    requirements, generally as a result of state-specific permitting
    procedures.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is
    established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion
    capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured
    density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted
    to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is
    forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors
    including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and
    projected waste density, estimated number of years of life
    remaining, depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to
    moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill
    leachate. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is
    subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering
    group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and
    revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally
    indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater
    later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the
    landfill approaches its highest point under the permit
    requirements.

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    available airspace, we also include the projected costs for
    development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost
    related to final capping, and closure and post-closure of the
    expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill
    amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream,
    geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the
    number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We
    then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us
    the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is
    received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton
    amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with
    each final capping event, for assets related to closure and
    post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or
    to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or
    higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the
    opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will
    receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is
    determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be
    considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill
    asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If
    it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion
    permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the
    expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— We are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
    that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities
    include potentially responsible party, or PRP, investigations,
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs
    directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such
    as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to
    the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with
    environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review
    and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our
    estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates
    and assumptions.

We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with



respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost
    for the likely remedy are then either developed using our
    internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or
    other service providers. Internally developed estimates are
    based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.

Asset Impairments

— Our long-lived assets,
    including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our
    financial statements based on their cost less accumulated
    depreciation or amortization. We review the carrying value of
    our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
    may not be recoverable. In order to assess whether a potential
    impairment exists, the assets’ carrying values are compared
    with their undiscounted expected future cash flows. Estimating
    future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors
    such as general economic conditions and projected growth rates,
    and our estimates often vary from cash flows eventually
    realized. Impairments are measured by comparing the fair value
    of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by
    either an internally developed discounted projected cash flow
    analysis of the asset or an actual third-party valuation. If the
    fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the
    carrying amount of the asset, an impairment in the amount of the
    difference is recorded in the period that the impairment
    indicator occurs.

There are other considerations for impairments of landfills and
    goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the carrying value of each Group’s goodwill to
    its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is
    determined by deducting the fair value of each Group’s
    identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the
    Group as a whole. We rely on discounted cash flow analysis,
    which requires significant judgments and estimates about the
    future operations of each Group, to develop our estimates of
    fair value. Additional impairment assessments may be performed
    on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in
    circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not,
    the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired.

Self-insurance reserves and recoveries

— We
    have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our
    health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our liabilities
    associated with the exposure for unpaid claims and associated
    expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, generally
    is estimated with the assistance of external actuaries and by
    factoring in pending claims and historical trends and data. Our
    estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly
    different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the
    frequency or severity of future incidents are significantly
    different than what we assume. Estimated insurance recoveries
    related to recorded liabilities are recorded as assets when we
    believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Operating
    Revenues

Our operating revenues in 2007 were $13.3 billion, compared
    with $13.4 billion in 2006 and $13.1 billion in 2005.
    We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and WMRA
    Groups. These six operating Groups are our reportable segments.
    Shown below (in millions) is the contribution to revenues during

Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
    collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling
    services. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of
    tipping fees, which are generally based on the weight, volume
    and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities.
    Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the
    volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of
    loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a
    disposal site. Our Wheelabrator revenues are based on the type
    and volume of waste received at our waste-to-energy facilities
    and IPPs and fees charged for the sale of energy and steam.
    Recycling revenue, which is generated by our WMRA Group as well
    as recycling operations embedded in the operations of our four
    geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of
    recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Our
    “other” revenues include our in-plant services,
    methane gas operations,
    Port-O-Let

services and street and parking lot sweeping services.

    the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our
    collection, transfer, disposal and waste-to-energy operations,
    exclusive of volume changes. Revenue growth from base business
    yield includes not only price increases, but also (i) price
    decreases to retain customers; (ii) changes in average
    price from new and lost business; and (iii) changes related
    to the overall mix of services, which are due principally to the
    types of services provided and the geographic locations where
    our services are provided.

In both 2006 and 2007, our pricing excellence initiative was the
    primary contributor to our base business yield growth. The
    increases in base business yield were driven by our collection
    operations, which experienced substantial growth in every
    geographic operating Group primarily as a result of our
    continued focus on pricing our services based on market-specific
    factors, including our costs. In 2006, increased collection
    revenues due to pricing were partially offset by revenue
    declines from lower collection volumes and in 2007, the
    increased collection revenues were more than offset by revenue
    declines from lower collection volumes. However, we continue to
    find that, in spite of collection volume declines, increased
    yield on base business and a focus on controlling variable costs
    provide notable margin improvements and earnings expansion in
    our collection line of business.

Throughout 2007, we experienced increases in revenue due to
    yield on base business from our pricing excellence initiatives
    at our transfer stations and the municipal solid waste, special
    waste and construction and demolition waste streams at our
    landfills. The increases in transfer station revenues in 2007
    were the most significant in the Eastern and Western portions of
    the United States. At our landfills, municipal solid waste
    revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the South
    and East; special waste revenue growth from yield was the most
    significant in the West; and our construction and demolition
    revenue growth from yield was the most significant in the South.

Revenues from our environmental fee, which is included in base
    business yield, were $121 million, $76 million and
    $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Commodity

— Recycling prices approached all
    time highs in 2007 and drove the substantial revenue growth from
    yield. Increases in the prices of the recycling commodities we
    process contributed $306 million of revenue growth in 2007.
    Average prices for old corrugated cardboard increased by 62% and
    average prices for old newsprint increased by 39% in 2007.
    Approximately 50% of the increase in revenue from yield on our
    recycling operations is associated with our relatively lower
    margin brokerage activities.

Our revenues in 2006 declined $48 million as compared with
    the prior year due to price decreases in recycling commodities.
    In 2006, average prices for old corrugated cardboard dropped by
    8% and average prices for old newsprint were down by about 7%.



Fuel surcharges and mandated fees

— Fuel
    surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by $29 million
    in 2007. This increase is due to our continued effort to pass on
    higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. We
    experienced relatively flat market prices for fuel for the first
    nine months of the year. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we
    experienced a significantly higher increase in market prices for
    fuel, which contributed all of the revenue increase due to fuel
    surcharges in 2007.

Fuel surcharges increased revenues year-over-year by
    $117 million for 2006. The substantial 2006 increases in
    revenue provided by our fuel surcharge program can generally be
    attributed to (i) increases in market prices for fuel;
    (ii) an increase in the number of customers who participate
    in our fuel surcharge program; and (iii) the revision of
    our fuel surcharge program at the beginning of the third quarter
    of 2005 to incorporate the indirect fuel cost increases passed
    on to us by subcontracted haulers and vendors.

Increases in our operating expenses due to higher diesel fuel
    prices include our direct fuel costs for our operations, which
    are included in

Operating Expenses — Fuel

, as
    well as estimated indirect fuel costs, which are included
    primarily in

Operating Expenses — Subcontractor
    Costs

.

The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily
    related to the pass-through of fees and taxes assessed by
    various state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our
    landfills and transfer stations. These mandated fees have not
    had a significant impact on the comparability of revenues for
    the periods included in the table above.

Volume

— The declines in our revenues due to
    lower volumes when comparing 2007 and 2006 with the
    corresponding prior year periods have been driven by declines in
    our collection volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower transfer
    station and third-party disposal volumes.

Volume reductions in 2007 have significantly affected the
    revenues of each of our collection lines of business in each
    geographic operating Group. Our industrial collection operations
    have experienced the most significant revenue declines due to
    lower volumes. Reduced volumes continue to be significantly
    affected by our focus on improving margins through increased
    pricing. Volume declines in our industrial collection business
    have also been affected by the significant slowdown in
    residential construction across the United States. Our
    commercial and residential collection operations have
    experienced revenue declines due to lower volumes in each
    geographic group as well.

Declines in revenue due to lower third-party volumes in our
    transfer station operations have been the most notable in our
    Eastern Group and can generally be attributed to the effects of
    pricing. In 2007, we also experienced declines in third-party
    revenue at our landfills due to reduced disposal volumes. The
    most significant declines were in our construction and
    demolition waste, particularly in our Southern Group. The
    reduction in construction and demolition volumes was largely due
    to the significant slowdown in residential construction across
    the United States. The volume declines for our municipal solid
    waste disposal operations have been the most significant in our
    Midwest Group due primarily to our focus on pricing increases.
    Waste-to-energy revenue from disposal volumes also declined in
    2007, largely due to the termination of an operating and
    maintenance agreement in May 2007. The revenue decline due to
    lower third-party volumes in our recycling business was
    primarily attributable to decreases in certain brokerage
    activities and the closure of a plastics processing facility.

The revenue declines in our collection businesses in 2006 were
    partially offset by increased disposal volumes in all of our
    geographic operating Groups through the first nine months of the
    year. Our special waste, municipal solid waste and construction
    and demolition waste streams were the primary drivers of this
    growth in revenues due to higher volumes. We believe that the
    strength of the economy throughout most of the year and
    favorable weather in many parts of the country were the primary
    drivers of the higher disposal volumes. In the fourth quarter of
    2006, we experienced a decline in disposal volumes as compared
    with the fourth quarter of 2005, which we believe was due to the
    lack of hurricane volumes in 2006, competition, impacts of our
    pricing initiatives and an economic softening that caused a
    significant decline in residential construction.

Divestitures

— Divestitures of under-performing
    and non-strategic operations accounted for decreased revenues of
    $320 million in 2007 and $154 million in 2006. These
    divestitures were primarily comprised of collection operations
    and, to a lesser extent, transfer station and recycling
    operations.



Operating
    Expenses

Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related
    benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and
    repairs included below), which include salaries and wages,
    bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and
    the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and
    disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party
    disposal facilities and transfer stations;
    (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment,
    vehicles and facilities and related labor costs;
    (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of
    independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to
    disposal facilities and are driven by transportation costs such
    as fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are
    primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with
    recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the
    costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill
    operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and
    taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees,
    host community fees and royalties; (viii) landfill
    operating costs, which include landfill remediation costs,
    leachate and methane collection and treatment, other landfill
    site costs and interest accretion on asset retirement
    obligations; (ix) risk management costs, which include
    workers’ compensation and insurance and claim costs and
    (x) other operating costs, which include, among other
    costs, equipment and facility rent and property taxes.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
    operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency
    translation, for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

The decreases in operating expenses for both 2007 and 2006 as
    compared with the prior year periods can be attributed primarily
    to (i) our efforts to maximize margin expansion by focusing
    on managing our fixed costs and reducing our variable costs;
    (ii) the divestiture of under-performing and low margin
    businesses; and (iii) volume declines due to our pricing
    program and the slowdown in residential construction. In 2007,
    our cost containment efforts had the most significant impact on
    our risk management and maintenance and repair costs, while the
    impact of divestitures and volume declines provided significant
    reductions in transfer, disposal and subcontractor costs. The
    operating expense declines during 2007 were partially offset by
    increased “Cost of goods sold” due to significantly
    higher commodity prices and “Other” operating expenses
    incurred for labor disputes in Oakland and Los Angeles,
    California. These expenses are discussed below.

In addition to lowering overall costs the last two years, our
    operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by
    1.2 percentage points for 2007, from 64.3% in 2006 to 63.1%
    in 2007, building on the improvement of 1.7 percentage
    points during 2006. The improvement in operating expenses as a
    percentage of revenues reflects our continued focus on
    identifying operational efficiencies that translate into cost
    savings, revenue growth on base business yield, shedding low
    margin volumes and divesting operations that are not improving.

As discussed above, the changes in our “Operating”
    expenses when comparing 2007, 2006 and 2005 can largely be
    attributed to our focus on cost control, volume declines and
    divestitures. Overall, these favorable items have been slightly
    offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in Canadian currency
    exchange rates. However, there



are several additional items that affect the comparability of
    our operating expenses by category for the periods presented.
    These additional items are summarized, by category, below:

Labor and related benefits

— In each year, wage
    increases due to annual merit adjustments have partially offset
    cost reductions due to headcount reductions related to operating
    efficiencies, divestitures and volume declines. During 2006,
    bonus expense was higher than either 2007 or 2005 due to the
    out-performance of 2006 incentive plan measures. The
    Company’s performance in both 2007 and 2005 was more in
    line with established incentive plan targets.

Transfer and disposal costs

— In addition to
    the impacts of divestitures and volume declines, the costs
    incurred by our collection operations to dispose of waste at
    third-party transfer stations or landfills have declined due to
    our focus on improving internalization.

Maintenance and repairs

— Throughout 2006 and
    2007, cost savings were generated from (i) various fleet
    initiatives targeted at improving our maintenance practices
    while reducing maintenance, parts and supplies costs; and
    (ii) changes in the scope of maintenance projects at our
    waste-to-energy facilities. In 2006, year-over-year reductions
    due to divestitures, volume declines and the items previously
    noted were outweighed by increased labor costs.

Subcontractor costs

— During the fourth quarter
    of 2007 and throughout 2006, we experienced increases in
    subcontractor costs due to higher diesel fuel prices, which
    drive the fuel surcharges we pay to third-party subcontractors.
    These cost increases were offset in part by the revenue
    generated from our fuel surcharge program, which is reflected as
    fuel yield increases within

Operating Revenues

.
    Additionally, in 2006, we incurred significant subcontractor
    costs during the first quarter of 2006 to assist in providing
    hurricane related services.

Cost of goods sold

— Fluctuations in these
    costs are generally based on changes in our recycling revenues
    because they are primarily related to rebates we pay to our
    recycling suppliers. When comparing 2007 with 2006,
    substantially higher market prices for recyclable commodities
    resulted in significant revenue growth and higher cost of goods
    sold. When comparing 2006 with 2005, these costs were lower due
    to a decrease in market prices for recyclable commodities and
    reduced recycling volumes. Additionally, in 2006, the decrease
    in costs of goods sold was partially due to the completion of
    the construction of an integrated waste facility in Canada in
    early 2006.

Fuel

— We experienced an estimated average
    increase of $0.18 per gallon for 2007 as compared with 2006 and
    of $0.31 per gallon for 2006 as compared with 2005. Fuel costs
    were relatively constant through the first nine months of 2007,
    but increased sharply during the fourth quarter. While our fuel
    surcharge is designed to respond to changes in the market price
    for fuel, the sharp increase late in 2007 negatively affected
    our ability to recover increased costs resulting from higher
    fuel prices within the year due to a lag in the timing of
    increased revenues following fuel cost increases. In each year,
    increased fuel costs have negatively affected our operating
    margin percentages. Revenues generated by our fuel surcharge
    program are reflected as fuel yield increases within

Operating Revenues.

Disposal and franchise fees and taxes

— In
    2007, these cost declines were partially due to the resolution
    of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern Group, which resulted in
    the recognition of $18 million in favorable adjustments to
    operating costs during 2007. In 2006, we experienced increases
    in rates for mandated fees and taxes in certain markets. Certain
    of these cost increases are passed through to our customers, and
    have been reflected as fee yield increases within

Operating
    Revenues.

Landfill operating costs

— These costs
    increased during 2007 due to charges for revisions in our
    estimates associated with remediation obligations and changes in
    the risk-free discount rate that we use to estimate the present
    value of these obligations. During 2007 we recorded an
    $8 million charge to reduce the discount rate from 4.75% to
    4.00% and during 2006 we recorded a $6 million decrease in
    expense to reflect an increase in the rate from 4.25% to 4.75%.
    For 2006, the cost increases as compared with 2005 generally
    related to higher site maintenance, leachate collection,
    monitoring and testing, and closure and post-closure expenses.

Risk management

— Over the last two years, we
    have been increasingly successful in reducing these costs, which
    can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced
    accident and injury rates. For 2007, the decrease in expense was
    largely associated with reduced actuarial projections of auto
    and general liability claims and, to a lesser extent, reduced
    workers’ compensation costs. During 2006, the decline in
    expenses as compared with 2005 was primarily due to reduced
    workers’ compensation costs.



Other operating expenses

— In the third and
    fourth quarters of 2007, we incurred a significant increase in
    “Other” expenses due in large part to costs incurred
    for labor disputes with the Teamsters Local 70 in Oakland,
    California that was resolved in July 2007 and with Teamsters
    Local 396 in Los Angeles that was resolved in October 2007.
    These labor disputes negatively affected the “Income from
    operations” of our Western Group by $37 million,
    including $33 million of additional “Other”
    operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    The increased operating costs were primarily related to security
    and the deployment and lodging costs incurred for the
    Company’s replacement workers who were brought to
    California from across the organization. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, our Eastern Group incurred
    $14 million for similar costs, which were primarily for a
    labor strike in the New York City area.

Also affecting the comparability of our “Other”
    operating expenses for 2007 as compared with 2006 were
    (i) $21 million of lease termination costs incurred
    during the first quarter of 2007 associated with the purchase of
    one of our independent power production plants that had
    previously been operated through a lease agreement;
    (ii) lower lease and rental expenses in 2007; and
    (iii) an increase in gains recognized on the sales of
    assets for 2007.

The lower costs in 2006 as compared with 2005 can be attributed
    to (i) Hurricane Katrina related support costs in 2005,
    particularly in Louisiana, where we built Camp Waste Management
    to house and feed employees who worked in the New Orleans area
    to help with the cleanup efforts; (ii) comparatively higher
    rental expense in 2005; and (iii) a decrease related to the
    deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in early 2006.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
    (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related
    insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and
    equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which
    include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services;
    (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances
    for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and
    (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which
    include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and
    data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment,
    rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial
    impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our
    “other” selling, general and administrative expenses.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
    selling, general and administrative costs for the years ended
    December 31 (in millions):

Our labor and related benefits, professional fees and other
    general and administrative costs for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 increased by $24 million as a result
    of non-capitalizable costs associated with investments in our
    information technology and our people strategies. Other
    significant changes in our selling, general and administrative
    expenses are summarized below.

Labor and related benefits

— In both 2007 and
    2006, these costs increased year-over-year due to higher
    compensation costs driven by an increase in the size of our
    sales force; increased investments in our information technology
    and people strategies, as noted above; higher non-cash
    compensation expense associated with the equity-based
    compensation provided for by our long-term incentive plan; and
    annual merit raises. The higher labor costs for our pricing,
    people and other initiatives are necessary as we implement new
    ways to grow our business and strengthen our ongoing operations.
    Our bonus expenses were relatively higher in 2006 than either
    2005 or 2007 due to the strength of our performance against
    incentive plan measures in that year. Fluctuations in our use of
    contract labor for corporate support functions also caused an
    increase in 2006 as compared with 2005. These cost increases in
    2006 were partially offset by savings associated with our 2005
    restructuring.

Professional Fees

— In both 2007 and 2006, our
    consulting fees increased as a result of our strategic
    initiatives. In 2007, this increase was offset by (i) lower
    consulting costs associated with our pricing initiatives; and



(ii) reductions in legal fees and expenses, largely as a
    result of higher costs in 2006 related to indemnification
    obligations for former officers in legacy litigation brought by
    the SEC.

Other

— Our “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses for the years ended 2007 and 2006
    included net charges of approximately $2 million and
    $20 million, respectively, to record our estimated
    obligations for unclaimed property. Refer to Note 10 of our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    related to the nature of these charges.

Additionally, in both 2007 and 2006, our other costs increased
    due to higher sales and marketing costs and higher travel and
    entertainment costs due partially to the development of our
    revenue management system and our efforts to implement various
    initiatives.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation of
    property and equipment, including assets recorded due to capital
    leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 50 years;
    (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those
    incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill
    development, construction, asset retirement costs arising from
    closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as
    landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining
    permitted and expansion capacity of a site;
    (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs
    arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption
    method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity
    associated with each final capping event; and
    (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite
    life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a
    straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related
    agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the
    type of asset.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,259 million,
    or 9.5% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2007;
    $1,334 million, or 10.0% of revenues, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006; and $1,361 million, or 10.4% of
    revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
    $75 million decrease when comparing 2007 with 2006 can be
    attributed, in part, to landfill volume declines. The
    $27 million decrease when comparing 2006 with 2005 was
    primarily due to the suspension of depreciation on assets
    held-for-sale and divestitures. Additonally, in both 2007 and
    2006 there were decreases in depreciation due to components of
    enterprise-wide software becoming fully depreciated.

The comparability of our depreciation and amortization expense
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 has
    also been significantly affected by (i) a $21 million
    charge to landfill amortization recognized in 2005 to adjust the
    amortization periods of nine of our leased landfills and
    (ii) adjustments to landfill airspace and landfill asset
    retirement cost amortization recorded in each year for changes
    in estimates related to our final capping, closure and
    post-closure obligations. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, landfill amortization
    expense was reduced by $17 million, $1 million and
    $13 million, respectively, for the effects of these changes
    in estimates. In each year, the majority of the reduced expense
    resulting from the revised estimates was associated with final
    capping changes.

Restructuring

Management continuously reviews our organization to determine if
    we are operating under the most advantageous structure. Our 2007
    and 2005 restructurings were the result of reviews that
    highlighted opportunities for efficiencies and cost savings. The
    most significant cost savings we have obtained through our
    restructurings have been attributable to the labor and related
    benefits component of our “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses.

In the first quarter of 2007, we restructured certain operations
    and functions, resulting in the recognition of a charge of
    approximately $9 million. We incurred an additional
    $1 million of costs for this restructuring during the
    second quarter of 2007, increasing the costs incurred to date to
    $10 million. Approximately $7 million of our
    restructuring costs was incurred by our Corporate organization,
    $2 million was incurred by our Midwest Group and
    $1 million was incurred by our Western Group. These charges
    included approximately $8 million for employee severance
    and benefit costs and approximately $2 million related to
    operating lease agreements.

During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified
    our organizational structure by eliminating certain support
    functions performed at the Group or Corporate office. We also
    eliminated the Canadian Group office, which reduced the number
    of our operating Groups from seven to six. This reorganization
    reduced costs at



the Group and Corporate offices and increased the accountability
    of our Market Areas. We recorded $28 million of pre-tax
    charges in 2005 for costs associated with the implementation of
    the new structure, principally for employee severance and
    benefit costs.

(Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale
    impairments)

— The net gains from divestitures in
    all three years were a result of our fix-or-seek exit
    initiative, and 2005 also included a $39 million gain from
    the divestiture of a landfill in Canada as a result of a
    Divestiture Order by the Competition Bureau. Gains recognized
    from divestitures in 2006 were partially offset by the
    recognition of aggregate impairment charges of $18 million
    for operations held for sale as required by
    SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.

Impairments of assets held-for-use

— During
    2007, we recognized $12 million in impairment charges due
    to impairments recognized for two landfills in our Southern
    Group. The impairments were necessary as a result of the
    re-evaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and
    the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be
    renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for
    the second landfill.

The $24 million of impairment charges recognized during
    2006 was primarily related to the impairment of a landfill in
    our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations
    for future expansions and the impairment of under-performing
    operations in our WMRA Group.

During the second quarter of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a
    $35 million charge for the impairment of the Pottstown
    Landfill in Pennsylvania. We determined that the impairment was
    necessary after the denial of a permit application for a
    vertical expansion at the landfill was upheld and we decided not
    to pursue an appeal of that decision. In addition, during 2005
    we recorded $68 million in impairment charges associated
    with capitalized software, driven by a $59 million charge
    for revenue management system software that had previously been
    under development. The remaining impairment charges recognized
    in 2005 were largely related to the impairment of a landfill in
    our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations
    for future expansions.

Other

— In both 2006 and 2005 we recognized
    charges associated with the termination of legal matters related
    to issues that arose in 2000 and earlier. In 2006, we recognized
    a $26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration
    ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture
    relationship in 2000. In 2005, we recognized a $16 million
    charge for the impact of a settlement reached with a group of
    stockholders that had opted not to participate in the settlement
    of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to
    1998 and 1999 activity and a $27 million charge to settle
    our ongoing defense costs associated with possible indemnity
    obligations to former officers of WM Holdings related to
    the litigation brought against them by the SEC. The 2005 charges
    were partially offset by the recognition of a net benefit of
    $12 million, primarily for adjustments to receivables and
    estimated obligations for non-solid waste operations that had
    been sold in 1999 and 2000.

Operating segments

— Increased yield on base
    business as a result of our pricing strategies, our continued
    focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies and
    higher-margin disposal volumes have improved the operating
    income of our geographic Groups each year during the three-year
    period ended December 31, 2007. Base business yield
    provided revenue growth for each line of business in 2007 and in
    2006, and was driven primarily by our collection operations,
    where we experienced substantial revenue growth in every
    geographic operating Group for the third consecutive year. The
    improvements in operating income have been partially offset by
    the effects of declines in revenues due to lower volumes, which
    generally are the result of pricing competition, as well as the
    significant downturn in residential construction and the
    slowdown of the general economic environment in 2007. See
    additional discussion in the

Operating Revenues

section
    above.

Other significant items affecting the comparability of the
    operating segments’ results of operations for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized below:

Eastern

— The Group’s operating income for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 includes (i) net
    divestiture gains of $33 million; (ii) an
    $18 million decrease in disposal fees and taxes due to the
    favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter; and (iii) a
    reduction in landfill amortization expense as a result of
    changes in certain estimates related to our final capping,
    closure and post-closure obligations. The Group’s operating
    income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively
    affected by $26 million in charges associated with
    (i) the impairment of businesses being sold as part of our
    divestiture program and (ii) the impairment of a landfill.
    The year ended December 31, 2005 was negatively affected by
    the recognition of $44 million in impairment charges
    related primarily to the Pottstown landfill. Finally, the
    operating results of our Eastern Group for 2006 and 2005 were
    negatively affected by costs incurred in connection with labor
    strikes. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred
    $14 million of costs related primarily to a strike in the
    New York City area. The Group incurred similar costs during the
    first quarter of 2005 for a labor strike in New Jersey, which
    decreased operating income for the year ended December 31,
    2005 by approximately $9 million.

Midwest

— Positively affecting operating
    results in 2007 and in 2005 were reductions in landfill
    amortization expense resulting from changes in certain estimates
    related to our final capping, closure and post-closure
    obligations.

Southern

— During 2007, the Group recorded
    $12 million of impairment charges attributable to two of
    its landfills. These charges were offset by gains on
    divestitures of $11 million. During 2005, several large
    non-recurring type items were recognized, impacting comparisons
    to the other periods presented. These items include
    $13 million of pre-tax gains recognized on the divestiture
    of operations during 2005 and declines in earnings related to
    (i) hurricanes, largely due to the temporary suspension of
    operations in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina;
    (ii) the effects of higher landfill amortization costs,
    generally due to reductions in landfill



amortization periods to align the lives of the landfills for
    amortization purposes with the terms of the underlying
    contractual agreements supporting their operations; and
    (iii) higher landfill amortization expense as a result of
    changes in certain estimates related to our final capping,
    closure and post-closure obligations.

Western

— The Group’s 2007 operating
    results were negatively affected by $37 million as a result
    of various labor disputes, which are discussed in the

Operating Expenses

section above. Gains on divestitures
    of operations were $16 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared with $48 million for
    2006 and $24 million for 2005.

Wheelabrator

— The decline in operating income
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by a
    $21 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007
    for the early termination of a lease agreement. The early
    termination was due to the Group’s purchase of an
    independent power production plant that it had previously
    operated through a lease agreement. Additionally, the
    termination of an operating and maintenance agreement in May
    2007 resulted in a decline in revenue and operating income
    compared with the prior years.

WMRA

— The Group’s 2007 operating income
    has benefited from substantial increases in market prices for
    commodities and $7 million of net gains on divestitures. In
    addition, the Group has experienced significant returns from
    operational improvements, including an increased focus on
    maintaining or reducing rebates made to suppliers. During 2006,
    the Group recognized $10 million of charges for a loss from
    a divestiture and an impairment of certain under-performing
    operations, which were slightly more than offset by savings
    associated with the Group’s cost control efforts. Income
    from operations in our WMRA Group during 2005 includes costs
    related to the deployment of new software.

Significant items affecting the comparability of the remaining
    components of our results of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized below:

Other

— The changes in operating results for
    the periods presented are largely related to certain year-end
    adjustments recorded in consolidation related to our reportable
    segments that were not included in the measure of segment income
    from operations used to assess their performance for the periods
    disclosed. The unfavorable change in operating results in 2007
    when compared with 2006 can also be attributed, in part, to the
    deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in April 2006. The
    favorable operating results in 2005 were also significantly
    affected by a $39 million pre-tax gain resulting from the
    divestiture of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada. This
    impact is included in “(Income) expense from divestitures,
    asset impairments and unusual items” within our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. As this landfill had been
    divested at the time of our 2005 reorganization, historical
    financial information associated with its operations has not
    been allocated to our remaining reportable segments.
    Accordingly, these impacts have been included in Other.

Corporate and Other

— In 2007 and 2006 we
    experienced significantly lower risk management costs largely
    due to our focus on safety and controlling costs. Other
    significant items occurring in 2007 include (i) a reduction
    in expenses from the discontinuation of depreciation for certain
    enterprise-wide software that is now fully depreciated;
    (ii) increased spending on the support and development of
    our information technology, people and pricing strategic
    initiatives; (iii) increased labor and related benefits
    costs; and (iv) restructuring charges.

When comparing 2006 operating results with 2005, in addition to
    lower risk management costs, we experienced lower employee
    health and welfare plan costs, also as a result of our focus on
    controlling costs. These cost savings were largely offset by:
    (i) a $20 million charge recorded to recognize
    unrecorded obligations associated with unclaimed property, which
    is discussed in the

Selling, General and Administrative

section above; (ii) increased incentive compensation
    expense; (iii) higher consulting fees and sales commissions
    primarily related to our pricing initiatives; (iv) an
    increase in our marketing costs due to our national advertising
    campaign; (v) the centralization of support functions that
    were provided by our Group offices prior to our 2005
    reorganization; and (vi) a $26 million charge
    associated with an arbitration ruling against us related to a
    joint venture relationship that terminated in 2000.

Our 2005 operating results include impairment charges of
    $68 million associated with capitalized software costs and
    $31 million of net charges associated with various legal
    and divestiture matters. Also contributing to expenses during
    2005 were costs at Corporate associated with our July 2005
    restructuring charge and other organizational changes, which
    were partially offset by the associated savings at Corporate.

    Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion
    of the relationship between current year and prior year activity.

Interest
    Expense

The variances in interest expense during the reported periods
    are generally related to (i) decreases in our outstanding
    debt balances due to our repayment of borrowings throughout 2006
    and 2007; (ii) the maturity of higher rate debt that we
    have effectively refinanced at lower interest rates; and
    (ii) fluctuations in market interest rates, which influence
    the impacts of our interest rate swaps and the interest rates of
    our variable rate debt.

We use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure
    to changes in market interest rates. The combined impact of
    active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in
    a net interest expense increase of $11 million for 2007 and
    $4 million for 2006. For the year ended December 31,
    2005, interest rate swaps reduced net interest expense by
    $39 million. The significant decline in the benefit
    recognized as a result of our active interest rate swap
    agreements is attributable to the increase in short-term market
    interest rates. Our periodic interest obligations under our
    active interest rate swap agreements are based on a spread from
    the three-month LIBOR, which has varied significantly during the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007. Specifically,
    the three-month LIBOR was as low as 2.75% in early 2005 and as
    high as 5.62% in the second half of 2007. Included in the
    $11 million net increase in interest expense realized in
    2007 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements is
    a $37 million reduction in interest expense related to the
    amortization of terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate
    swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by
    $33 million in 2008, $19 million in 2009 and
    $12 million in 2010.

Interest
    Income

In 2007, decreases in our average cash and investment balances
    on a year-over-year basis resulted in a decline in interest
    income. In addition, interest income for 2006 included interest
    income of $14 million realized on tax refunds received from
    the IRS for the settlement of several federal audits. When
    comparing 2006 with 2005, the increase in interest income was
    due to the 2006 tax refund and an increase in our investments in
    variable rate demand notes and auction rate securities
    throughout the year.

Equity
    in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities

Our “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities”
    is primarily related to our equity interests in two coal-based
    synthetic fuel production facilities. Our equity in the losses
    of these facilities was $42 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, $41 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 and $112 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The equity losses generated by the
    facilities are offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of
    these investments as discussed below within

Provision for
    (benefit from) income taxes.

Our equity in the losses of the facilities in both 2007 and 2006
    have been significantly affected by our expectations for a
    partial phase-out of Section 45K credits on our contractual
    obligations associated with funding the facilities’ losses.
    The IRS has not yet published the phase-out percentage that must
    be applied to Section 45K tax credits generated in 2007.
    Accordingly, we have used market information for oil prices to
    estimate that we expect 69% of Section 45K tax credits
    generated in 2007 to be phased-out. The IRS establishment of the
    final phase-out of



Section 45K credits generated during 2007 could further
    impact the equity in losses of the facilities we recognized for
    2007. Any subsequent adjustment to the amount of realizable
    Section 45K credits and related equity losses will be
    reflected in our 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2006, we had estimated that 36% of
    Section 45K tax credits generated during 2006 would be
    phased out. On April 4, 2007, the IRS established the final
    phase-out of Section 45K credits generated during 2006 at
    approximately 33%. We did not experience any phase-out of
    Section 45K tax credits in 2005.

In addition, the facilities temporarily suspended operations in
    May 2006, reducing our obligations associated with funding the
    facilities’ losses for the year ended December 31,
    2006. During the second quarter of 2006, we also recognized a
    cumulative adjustment necessary to appropriately reflect our
    life-to-date obligations to fund the costs of operating the
    facilities and the value of our investment.

Minority
    Interest

On December 31, 2003, we consolidated two limited liability
    companies that own three waste-to-energy facilities operated by
    our Wheelabrator Group as a result of our implementation of
    FIN 46(R). Our minority interest expense for 2007, 2006 and
    2005 is primarily related to the other members’ equity
    interest in the earnings of these entities. Additional
    information related to these investments is included in
    Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Provision
    for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

We recorded a provision for income taxes of $540 million in
    2007 and $325 million in 2006, and a benefit from income
    taxes of $90 million in 2005. These tax provisions resulted
    in an effective income tax rate of approximately 31.7%, 22.1%
    and (8.2)% for each of the three years, respectively. The
    comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is primarily affected by
    (i) increases in our income before taxes and
    (ii) differences in the impacts of tax audit settlements
    and non-conventional fuel tax credits, which are discussed in
    more detail below. Other items that have affected our reported
    income taxes during the reported periods include the following:

•

Canadian tax rate changes and the related revaluation of
    deferred tax balances resulted in a $30 million tax benefit
    during 2007 compared with a $20 million tax benefit in 2006
    and $4 million of additional income tax expense in 2005.

•

We recorded reductions to income tax expense of $9 million
    in 2007, $20 million in 2006 and $16 million in 2005
    due to state-related tax items. These impacts were generally due
    to either (i) the revaluation of net accumulated deferred
    tax liabilities as a result of a decrease in our effective state
    tax rate or (ii) reductions in our valuation allowance
    related to the expected utilization of state net operating loss
    and credit carryforwards.

•

In 2005, we recognized $34 million of tax expense for the
    repatriation of net accumulated earnings and capital from
    certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in accordance with the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

The impacts of tax audit settlements and non-conventional fuel
    tax credits, which are the items that had the most significant
    impacts on the comparability of our effective tax rate during
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, are
    summarized below:

•

Tax audit settlements

— When excluding the
    effect of interest income, the settlement of various federal and
    state tax audits resulted in a reduction in income tax expense
    of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    (representing a 2.3 percentage point reduction in our
    effective tax rate), $149 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 (representing a 10.1 percentage
    point reduction in our effective tax rate) and $398 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 (representing a
    36.4 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate).

•

Non-conventional fuel tax credits

— Non-conventional fuel tax credits are derived
    from our landfills and our investments in the two coal-based,
    synthetic fuel production facilities discussed in the

Equity
    in net losses of unconsolidated entities

section above.
    Pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code, these
    tax credits are phased-out if the price of oil exceeds an annual
    average as determined by the IRS. Based on an



estimated phase-out of 69% of Section 45K tax credits
    generated during 2007, our income taxes for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 include $50 million of
    non-conventional fuel tax credits. These tax credits resulted in
    a 2.9 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate
    for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our income taxes for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 included $71 million
    of non-conventional fuel tax credits, resulting in a
    4.8 percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate,
    and our income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005
    included $133 million of non-conventional fuel tax credits,
    resulting in a 12.2 percentage point reduction in our
    effective tax rate.

Non-conventional fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2007
    pursuant to Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Accordingly, at current income levels, we expect that our 2008
    effective tax rate will be approximately 40% without the benefit
    of the tax credits.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our
    liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our
    present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may
    arise during the year as a result of changing business
    conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working
    capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
    ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
    construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
    to and maintenance of our trucking fleet;
    (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at
    waste-to-energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the
    container and equipment needs of our operations;
    (v) capping, closure and post-closure activities at our
    landfills; and (vi) repaying debt and discharging other
    obligations. We also are committed to providing our shareholders
    with a return on their investment through our capital allocation
    program that provides for dividend payments, share repurchases
    and investments in acquisitions that we believe will be
    accretive and provide continued growth in our business.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allowed
    U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign
    subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005. Our Chief
    Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic
    reinvestment plan under which we repatriated $496 million
    of our accumulated foreign earnings and capital in 2005. The
    repatriation was funded with cash on hand and bank borrowings.
    For a discussion of the tax impact and bank borrowings see
    Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates
    of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade
    commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three
    months or less.

Short-term investments available for use

—
    Periodically, we have invested in auction rate securities and
    variable rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with
    long-term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset
    dates. The interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments
    results in a periodic remarketing of the underlying securities
    through an auction process. Due to the liquidity provided by the
    interest rate reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our
    investment in these securities, they have been classified as
    current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the
    decline in our overall cash balances near the end of 2007, we
    did not hold any of these investments as of December 31,
    2007.

Restricted trust and escrow accounts

—
    Restricted trust and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds
    held in trust for the construction of various facilities or
    repayment of our debt obligations, funds deposited for purposes
    of settling landfill closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These
    balances are primarily included within long-term “Other
    assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    discussion.

Debt

— We use long-term borrowings in addition
    to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall
    financial strategy to support and grow our business. We
    primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a
    long-term basis, but also use other instruments and facilities
    when appropriate. The components of our long-term borrowings as
    of December 31, 2007 are described in Note 7 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in our outstanding debt balances from December 31,
    2006 to December 31, 2007 can primarily be attributed to
    (i) the cash repayment of $1,200 million of
    outstanding borrowings at their scheduled maturities;
    (ii) $944 million of cash borrowings, generally to
    refinance amounts repaid in cash during the year;
    (iii) non-cash proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of
    principal payments made directly from trust funds of
    $144 million; (iv) a $53 million increase in the
    carrying value of our debt due to hedge accounting for interest
    rate swaps; and (v) the impacts of accounting for other
    non-cash changes in our balances due to foreign currency
    translation, interest and capital leases.

We have approximately $1.2 billion of scheduled debt
    maturities during the next twelve months. We have classified
    approximately $840 million of these borrowings as long-term
    as of December 31, 2007 based on our intent and ability to
    refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities — The
    comparability of our operating cash flows for the periods
    presented is affected by our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires reductions in income taxes
    payable attributable to excess tax benefits associated with
    equity-based transactions to be included in cash flows from
    financing activities, which are discussed below. Prior to
    adopting SFAS No. 123(R), our excess tax benefits
    associated with equity-based transactions were included within
    cash flows from operating activities as a change in
    “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.” During
    2005, these excess tax benefits improved our operating cash
    flows by approximately $17 million.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    operating cash flows for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below:

•

Earnings improvements

— Our income from
    operations, net of depreciation and amortization, increased by
    $150 million, on a year-over-year basis, which positively
    affected our cash flows from operations in 2007.



•

Decreased income tax payments and refunds —

Cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits
    associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately
    $80 million lower on a year-over-year basis, largely due to
    excess tax payments in 2006, which reduced our estimated tax
    payment made in the third quarter of 2007. Cash tax refunds
    attributable to audit settlements decreased by approximately
    $40 million on a year-over-year basis.

•

Risk management assets and liabilities —

During
    2007, we have been able to reduce risk management liabilities by
    approximately $80 million, primarily as a result of reduced
    actuarial projections of claim losses for auto and general
    liability and worker’s compensation claims, which can be
    attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident
    and injury rates. While this non-cash reserve reduction has had
    a positive impact on income from operations, it did not have a
    significant impact on our cash flow from operations.

•

Trade receivables —

The change in our
    receivables balances, net of effects of acquisitions and
    divestitures, negatively affected the comparison of our cash
    flows from operations by approximately $70 million. This
    decline is primarily attributable to increased trade receivables
    when comparing 2007 and 2006 as compared to decreased trade
    receivables when comparing 2006 to 2005.

•

Increased bonus payments —

Our bonus payments
    for 2006, which were paid in the first quarter of 2007, were
    higher than bonus payments for 2005 paid in 2006 due to the
    relative strength of our financial performance against incentive
    plan measures in 2006 as compared with 2005. The comparative
    changes in our liabilities for bonuses negatively affected the
    comparison of our cash flow from operations by approximately
    $60 million.

•

Liabilities for unclaimed property

— In 2007,
    we made significant cash payments for our obligations associated
    with unclaimed property, reducing our liabilities. In 2006, our
    liabilities for unclaimed property increased, primarily due to
    the charge to earnings required to fully record our obligations.
    The changes in our recorded obligations for unclaimed property
    negatively affected the comparison of our cash flow from
    operations by approximately $30 million.

The most significant items affecting the comparison of our
    operating cash flows for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below:

•

Earnings improvements

— Our income from
    operations, net of depreciation and amortization, increased by
    $292 million, on a year-over-year basis. This increase
    positively affected our cash flows from operations in 2006.

•

Receivables

— The change in our receivables
    balances, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures,
    provided a source of cash of $12 million in 2006, compared
    to a use of cash in 2005 of $102 million. In 2006, our
    receivables balances declined in part due to a decrease in
    fourth quarter revenues as compared with the prior year, but
    also due to improved efficiency of collections as a result of
    new processes we implemented to assist our Market Areas with
    collections. The increases in our receivables balances, and
    resulting uses of cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows, in 2005 were primarily related to increased revenues.

•

Increased tax payments

— We made income tax
    payments of $475 million in 2006 and $233 million in
    2005. The increase in 2006 is primarily the result of improved
    earnings and a decline in the tax benefit of Section 45K tax
    credits. The decline in the benefit of Section 45K tax
    credits when comparing 2006 with 2005 was largely due to a 36%
    phase-out of the credits generated during 2006 and the temporary
    shutdown of our two coal-based synthetic fuel production
    facilities, which generate a significant portion of the credits,
    from May 2006 to late-September 2006. There was no phase-out of
    Section 45K tax credits or temporary shutdown of the
    coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities in 2005.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Capital expenditures —

We used
    $1,211 million during 2007 for capital expenditures,
    compared with $1,329 million in 2006 and
    $1,180 million in 2005. Increased capital expenditures in
    2006 were due to relatively high levels of fleet capital
    spending in order to adequately prepare for any potential
    operational difficulties that could be encountered as a result
    of significant mandated changes in heavy-duty truck engines
    beginning in January 2007.



•

Purchases and sales of short-term investments —

Net sales of short-term investments provided
    $184 million of cash in 2007, compared with
    $122 million during 2006 and net purchases of
    $295 million during 2005. In both 2006 and 2007, we
    decreased our short-term investments to provide cash that we
    used to fund our common stock repurchases, dividend payments and
    debt repayments, which are discussed below.

•

Proceeds from divestitures —

Proceeds from
    divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets
    were $278 million in 2007, $240 million in 2006 and
    $194 million in 2005. In 2006 and 2007, our proceeds from
    divestitures have been driven by the divestiture of
    under-performing and non-strategic operations. Approximately
    $89 million of our 2005 proceeds were related to the sale
    of one of our landfills in Ontario, Canada as required by a
    Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Tribunal.

•

Cash paid for acquisitions —

Our spending on
    acquisitions increased from $32 million during 2006 to
    $90 million in 2007 due to an increased focus on accretive
    acquisitions and other investments that will contribute to
    improved future results of operations and enhance and expand our
    existing service offerings. Cash paid for acquisitions in 2005
    was $142 million, and was related principally to tuck-in
    acquisitions of relatively small operations that could be easily
    integrated with our core operations.

•

Net receipts from restricted funds —

Net funds
    received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts, which
    are largely generated from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for
    our capital needs, contributed $120 million to our
    investing activities in 2007 compared with $253 million in
    2006 and $395 million in 2005. The decrease is generally
    due to a decline in new tax-exempt borrowings.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

— The
    most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing
    cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:

•

Share repurchases and dividend payments —

Our
    2007, 2006 and 2005 share repurchases and dividend payments
    have been made in accordance with a three-year capital
    allocation program that was approved by our Board of Directors.
    This capital allocation program authorized up to
    $1.2 billion of combined share repurchases and dividend
    payments each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. In June 2006, the
    Board of Directors authorized up to $350 million of
    additional share repurchases in 2006, increasing the total of
    capital authorized for share repurchases and dividends in 2006
    to $1.55 billion. In March 2007, our Board of Directors
    approved up to $600 million of additional share repurchases
    for 2007, and in November 2007 approved up to $300 million
    of additional share repurchases. As a result, the maximum amount
    of capital to be allocated to our share repurchases and dividend
    payments in 2007 was $2.1 billion. Any remaining portion of
    the $300 million of additional share repurchases approved
    by the Board of Directors in November 2007 that was not utilized
    in 2007 may be utilized in future years.

In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new capital
    allocation program that includes the authorization for up to
    $1.4 billion in combined cash dividends and common stock
    repurchases in 2008. Approximately $184 million of the
    additional authorization of $300 million in November 2007
    was not used in 2007. As a result, the maximum amount of capital
    to be allocated to our share repurchases and dividend payments
    in 2008 is $1,584 million. We currently intend to allocate
    up to $1.4 billion of capital to dividends and share
    repurchases in 2008.

We paid $1,421 million for share repurchases in 2007, as
    compared with $1,072 million in 2006 and $706 million
    in 2005. We repurchased approximately 40 million,
    31 million and 25 million shares of our common stock
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We currently expect to
    continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation
    program discussed above.

We paid an aggregate of $495 million in cash dividends
    during 2007 compared with $476 million in 2006 and
    $449 million in 2005. The increase in dividend payments is
    due to our quarterly per share dividend increasing from $0.20 in
    2005, to $0.22 in 2006 and to $0.24 in 2007. The impact of the
    year-over-year increases in the per share dividend has been
    partially offset by a reduction in the number of our outstanding
    shares as a result of our share repurchase program. In December
    2007, the Board of Directors announced that it expects future
    quarterly dividend payments will be $0.27 per share. All future
    dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net
    earnings, financial condition, cash required for future
    prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant.



•

Proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of options and
    warrants —

The exercise of common stock options
    and warrants and the related excess tax benefits generated a
    total of $168 million of financing cash inflows during
    2007, compared with $340 million in 2006 and
    $129 million in 2005. We believe the significant increase
    in stock option and warrant exercises in 2006 was due to the
    substantial increase in the market value of our common stock
    during 2006. The accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock
    options in December 2005 also resulted in increased cash
    proceeds from stock option exercises because the acceleration
    made additional options available for exercise. As discussed
    above, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1,
    2006 resulted in the classification of tax savings provided by
    equity-based compensation as a financing cash inflow rather than
    an operating cash inflow beginning in the first quarter of 2006.
    This change in accounting increased cash flows from financing
    activities by $26 million in 2007 and $45 million in
    2006.

•

Net debt repayments —

Net debt repayments were
    $256 million in 2007, $500 million in 2006 and
    $11 million in 2005. The following summarizes our most
    significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during each
    year (in millions):

Change in cash overdraft position —

Changes in
    our cash overdraft position are reflected as “Other”
    financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
    Flows. The significant changes in our cash overdraft positions
    as of each year-end are generally attributable to the timing of
    cash deposits.

We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely.
    As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been
    included in the above table. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    these contingencies.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated
    entities as discussed in the

Guarantees

section of
    Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our
    third-party guarantee arrangements are generally established to
    support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations.
    These arrangements have not materially affected our financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity during the year
    ended December 31, 2007 nor are they expected to have a
    material impact on our future financial position, results of
    operations or liquidity.

Seasonal
    Trends and Inflation

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
    during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
    and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
    trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
    that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
    the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005, can actually
    increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for
    several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
    Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
    months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities.

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
    fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we
    believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near
    future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on
    our results of operations. However, management’s estimates
    associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have,
    an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental
    remediation liabilities.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2008. We do not currently expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 to
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
    However, we are continuing to assess the potential effects of
    SFAS No. 157 as additional guidance becomes available.

SFAS No. 159 —
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

—

Including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115

, which permits entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for the
    Company beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has elected
    not to measure eligible items at fair value upon initial
    adoption and does not believe the adoption of this statement
    will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

SFAS No. 141(R) —
    Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and
    measures in the financial statements the



identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    non-controlling interest in the acquiree. This statement also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination and determines what
    information to disclose to enable users of the financial
    statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
    business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) will be
    effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. We are
    currently evaluating the effect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our accounting and
    reporting for future acquisitions.

SFAS No. 160 —
    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an
    amendment of ARB No. 51

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160
    will be effective for the Company beginning January 1,
    2009. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of
    SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market
    risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency
    rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use
    derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our
    derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that
    provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no
    multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2007, all of
    our derivative transactions were related to actual or
    anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did
    not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk
    in the event of non-performance by our derivative
    counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by
    regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of
    the counterparties, all of whom we either consider
    credit-worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support
    their performance.

We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market
    rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk
    sensitive derivatives and related positions. These analyses are
    inherently limited because they reflect a singular, hypothetical
    set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary
    significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market
    movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions
    and our rights and obligations not covered by the sensitivity
    analyses. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative
    of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the
    assumed market rate movements.

Interest Rate Exposure.

Our exposure to market
    risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt
    obligations, which are primarily denominated in
    U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to
    manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations,
    which directly impacts variability in interest costs. An
    instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates
    across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have
    decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate
    swap positions by approximately $445 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $460 million at
    December 31, 2006. This analysis does not reflect the
    effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items,
    such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would
    have on interest expense and cash payments for interest.

We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have
    $418 million and $377 million of assets held in
    restricted trust funds and escrow accounts primarily included
    within long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    These assets are generally restricted for future capital
    expenditures and closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation activities at our disposal facilities and are,
    therefore, invested in high quality, liquid instruments
    including money market accounts and U.S. government agency
    debt securities. Because of the short terms to maturity of these
    investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair
    value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant.

Currency Rate Exposure.

From time to time, we
    have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of
    currency translation on cash flows of intercompany
    Canadian-currency denominated debt transactions. Our foreign



currency derivatives have not materially affected our financial
    position or results of operations for the periods presented. In
    addition, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates could
    significantly affect the fair value of our foreign currency
    derivatives, we believe these changes in fair value would not
    have a material impact to the Company.

Commodities Price Exposure.

We market recycled
    products such as wastepaper, aluminum and glass from our
    material recovery facilities. We have entered into commodity
    swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from
    a portion of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a
    floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed
    period of time. With regard to our option agreements, we have
    purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via
    synthetic floors (put options) and price protection on certain
    wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options).
    Additionally, we have entered into collars (combination of a put
    and call option) with financial institutions in which we receive
    the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a
    specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value
    of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings,
    as required. The fair value position of our commodity
    derivatives is not material to our financial position at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal
    controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to
    (i) the reliability of our financial reporting;
    (ii) the reliability of the preparation and presentation of
    the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States; and (iii) the safeguarding of assets from
    unauthorized use or disposition.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Through this
    evaluation, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our
    internal controls. There are inherent limitations in the
    effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
    reporting; however, based on our evaluation, we have concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Waste Management, Inc. at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)” and FASB
    Staff Position

No. FIN 48-1

“Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48.” Additionally, effective January 1, 2006,
    the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Waste
    Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 18, 2008 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waste Management, Inc.

We have audited Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Waste Management,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 and our report dated February 18,
    2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

1.

Business

The financial statements presented in this report represent the
    consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
    our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
    variable interest entities for which we have determined that we
    are the primary beneficiary (See Note 19). Waste
    Management, Inc. is a holding company and all operations are
    conducted by subsidiaries. When the terms “the
    Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”
    are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste
    Management, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated
    variable interest entities. When we use the term
    “WMI,” we are referring only to the parent holding
    company.

We are the leading provider of integrated waste services in
    North America. Using our vast network of assets and employees,
    we provide a comprehensive range of waste management services.
    Through our subsidiaries we provide collection, transfer,
    recycling, disposal and waste-to-energy services. In providing
    these services, we actively pursue projects and initiatives that
    we believe make a positive difference for our environment,
    including recovering and processing the methane gas produced
    naturally by landfills into a renewable energy source. Our
    customers include commercial, industrial, municipal and
    residential customers, other waste management companies,
    electric utilities and governmental entities.

We manage and evaluate our principal operations through six
    operating Groups, of which four are organized by geographic area
    and two are organized by function. The geographic Groups include
    our Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western Groups, and the two
    functional Groups are our Wheelabrator Group, which provides
    waste-to-energy services, and our WM Recycle America, or WMRA,
    Group, which provides recycling services not managed by our
    geographic Groups. We also provide additional waste management
    services that are not managed through our six Groups, which are
    presented in this report as “Other.” Refer to
    Note 20 for additional information related to our segments.

Accounting
    Changes and Reclassifications

Accounting
    Changes

FIN 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109)

. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement
    recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected
    to be taken in tax returns. In addition, FIN 48 provides
    guidance on the de-recognition, classification and disclosure of
    tax positions, as well as the accounting for related interest
    and penalties. On May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FSP

No. FIN 48-1,

Definition of

Settlement

in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48

, to provide guidance associated with the
    criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position
    has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax
    benefit.

Our adoption of FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1

effective January 1, 2007 resulted in the recognition of a
    $28 million increase in our liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits, a $32 million increase in our non-current
    deferred tax assets and a $4 million increase in our
    beginning retained earnings as a cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle.

Refer to Note 8 for additional information about our
    unrecognized tax benefits.

SFAS No. 158 —
    Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

.
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the
    overfunded or underfunded status of their defined benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans as an asset or liability
    and to recognize changes in that funded status through
    comprehensive

    (Continued)

income in the year in which the changes occur. As required, the
    Company adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31,
    2006, we recorded a liability and a corresponding deferred loss
    adjustment to “Accumulated other comprehensive income”
    of $2 million related to the previously unaccrued liability
    balance associated with our defined benefit pension and other
    post-retirement plans. The December 31, 2006 net
    increase of $1 million in “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” attributable to the underfunded
    status of our post-retirement plans is associated with the net
    impact of adjustments to increase deferred tax assets by
    $3 million, partially offset by the additional
    $2 million related to liabilities recorded.

SFAS No. 123(R) —
    Share-Based Payment

On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, which requires
    compensation expense to be recognized for all share-based
    payments made to employees based on the fair value of the award
    at the date of grant. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using
    the modified prospective method, which results in (i) the
    recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based awards granted or
    modified after December 31, 2005 and (ii) the
    recognition of compensation expense using the provisions of

for all unvested awards outstanding at the date
    of adoption. Under this transition method, the results of
    operations of prior periods have not been restated. Accordingly,
    we will continue to provide pro forma financial information for
    periods prior to January 1, 2006 to illustrate the effect
    on net income and earnings per share of applying the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Through December 31, 2005, as permitted by
    SFAS No. 123, we accounted for equity-based
    compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees

, as amended. Under APB No. 25, we recognized
    compensation expense based on an award’s intrinsic value.
    For stock options, which were the primary form of equity-based
    awards we granted through December 31, 2004, this meant we
    recognized no compensation expense in connection with the
    grants, as the exercise price of the options was equal to the
    fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and
    all other provisions were fixed. As discussed below, beginning
    in 2005, restricted stock units and performance share units
    became the primary form of equity-based compensation awarded
    under our long-term incentive plans. For restricted stock units,
    intrinsic value is equal to the market value of our common stock
    on the date of grant. For performance share units, APB
    No. 25 required “variable accounting,” which
    resulted in the recognition of compensation expense based on the
    intrinsic value of each award at the end of each reporting
    period until such time that the number of shares to be issued
    and all other provisions are fixed.

The most significant difference between the fair value
    approaches prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and
    SFAS No. 123(R) and the intrinsic value method
    prescribed by APB No. 25 relates to the recognition of
    compensation expense for stock option awards based on their
    grant date fair value. Under SFAS No. 123, we
    estimated the fair value of stock option grants using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following table
    reflects the pro forma impact on net income and earnings per
    common share for the year ended December 31, 2005 of

In December 2005, the Management Development and Compensation
    Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of
    the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our
    stock incentive plans, effective December 28, 2005. The
    decision to accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options
    was made primarily to reduce the non-cash compensation expense
    that we would have otherwise recorded in future periods as a
    result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). We estimated that
    the acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of
    cumulative pre-tax compensation charges that would have been
    recognized during 2006, 2007 and 2008 as the stock options would
    have continued to vest. We recognized a $2 million pre-tax
    charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005
    as a result of the acceleration, but do not expect to recognize
    future compensation expense for the accelerated options under
    SFAS No. 123(R). Total equity-based compensation
    expense per SFAS No. 123, net of tax benefit as
    presented in the table above, includes a pro forma charge of
    $41 million, net of tax benefit, for the December 2005
    accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options.

Additionally, as a result of changes in accounting required by
    SFAS No. 123(R) and a desire to design our long-term
    incentive plans in a manner that creates a stronger link to
    operating and market performance, the Management Development and
    Compensation Committee approved a substantial change in the form
    of awards that we grant. Beginning in 2005, annual stock option
    grants were eliminated and, for key members of our management
    and operations personnel, replaced with grants of restricted
    stock units and performance share units. Stock option grants in
    connection with new hires and promotions were replaced with
    grants of restricted stock units. The terms of our restricted
    stock units and performance share units are summarized in
    Note 15.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

As a result of the acceleration of the vesting of stock options
    and the replacement of future awards of stock options with other
    forms of equity awards, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 did not
    significantly affect our accounting for equity-based
    compensation or our net income for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 or 2006. We do not currently expect this
    change in accounting to significantly impact our future results
    of operations. However, we do expect equity-based compensation
    expense to increase over the next two years because of the
    incremental expense that will be recognized each year as
    additional awards are granted.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we included
    all tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation as
    operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires any reduction in taxes
    payable resulting from tax deductions that exceed the recognized
    tax benefit associated with compensation expense (excess tax
    benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. We included
    $26 million and $45 million of excess tax benefits in
    our cash flows from financing activities for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively that would have
    been classified as an operating cash flow if we had not been
    required to adopt SFAS No. 123(R). During the year
    ended December 31, 2005, excess tax benefits improved our
    operating cash flows by approximately $17 million.

Reclassifications

In the first quarter of 2007, we realigned our Eastern, Midwest
    and Western Group organizations to facilitate improved business
    execution. We reassigned responsibility for the management of
    certain market areas in the Eastern and Midwest Groups to the
    Midwest and Western Groups, respectively. In addition, in early
    2007 we moved certain of our WMRA operations to our Western
    Group to more closely align their recycling operations with the
    related collection, transfer and disposal operations. We have
    reflected the impact of these realignments for all periods
    presented to provide financial information that consistently
    reflects our current approach to managing our operations. Refer
    to Note 20 for further discussion about our reportable
    segments.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of WMI, its wholly-owned and majority-owned
    subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we
    have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All
    material intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities in which we do not have a
    controlling financial interest are accounted for under either
    the equity method or cost method of accounting, as appropriate.

Estimates
    and assumptions

In preparing our financial statements, we make numerous
    estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and
    recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities,
    stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses. We must make
    these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
    we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
    a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
    be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
    In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
    determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
    preparing our financial statements, the most difficult,
    subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
    with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting
    for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset
    impairments, and self-insurance reserves and recoveries. Each of
    these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual
    results could differ materially from the estimates and
    assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial
    statements.

Cash
    and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit,
    certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment
    grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of
    three months or less.

Short-term
    investments available for use

Periodically, we invest in auction rate securities and variable
    rate demand notes, which are debt instruments with long-term
    scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates. The
    interest rate reset mechanism for these instruments results in a
    periodic remarketing of the underlying securities through an
    auction process. Due to the liquidity provided by the interest
    rate reset mechanism and the short-term nature of our investment
    in these securities, they have been classified as current assets
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31,
    2006, $184 million of investments in auction rate
    securities and variable rate demand notes have been included as
    a component of current “Other assets.” We did not have
    any investments in this type of securities as of
    December 31, 2007. Gross purchases and sales of these
    investments are presented within “Cash flows from investing
    activities” in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Concentrations
    of credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term investments, investments held within our
    trust funds and escrow accounts, accounts receivable and
    derivative instruments. We control our exposure to credit risk
    associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets
    and other financial interests with a diverse group of
    credit-worthy financial institutions; (ii) holding
    high-quality financial instruments while limiting investments in
    any one instrument; and (iii) maintaining strict policies
    over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit
    limits and monitoring procedures, although generally we do not
    have collateral requirements. In addition, our overall credit
    risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the
    large number of geographically diverse customers we service. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, no single customer represented
    greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.

Trade
    and other receivables

Our receivables are recorded when billed or advanced and
    represent claims against third parties that will be settled in
    cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net
    realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful
    accounts based on historical collection trends, type of
    customer, such as municipal or non-municipal, the age of
    outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions. If
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific
    receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is
    given to the collectibility of those balances and the allowance
    is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are
    written-off when our internal collection efforts have been
    unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Also, we recognize
    interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable
    as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes.

Landfill
    accounting

Cost Basis of Landfill Assets

— We capitalize
    various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept
    waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land
    (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer
    property), permitting, excavation, liner material and
    installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
    collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
    groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
    capitalized interest, and

on-site

road
    construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost
    basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future
    costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities in accordance with
    SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

and its Interpretations. These costs are
    discussed below.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs

—
    Following is a description of our asset retirement activities
    and our related accounting:

•

Final Capping

— Involves the installation
    of flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners,
    drainage and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a
    landfill where total airspace capacity has been consumed. Final
    capping asset retirement obligations are recorded on a
    units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed related to
    the specific final capping event with a corresponding increase
    in the landfill asset. Each final capping event is accounted for
    as a discrete obligation and recorded as an asset and a
    liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows and
    capacity associated with each final capping event.

•

Closure

— Includes the construction of the
    final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required),
    demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs
    incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but before the
    landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state
    regulatory agency. These costs are accrued as an asset
    retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of
    the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill
    asset. Closure obligations are accrued over the life of the
    landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows
    associated with performing closure activities.

•

Post-Closure

— Involves the maintenance and
    monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by
    the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to
    maintain and monitor landfill sites for a

30-year

period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an
    asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the
    life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the
    landfill asset. Post-closure obligations are accrued over the
    life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash
    flows associated with performing post-closure activities.

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from
    our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our
    estimates are based on our interpretation of current
    requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to
    approximate fair value under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 143. Absent quoted market prices, the
    estimate of fair value should be based on the best available
    information, including the results of present value techniques.
    In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our
    obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use
    historical experience, professional engineering judgment and
    quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the
    fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize
    these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract
    with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those
    instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the
    incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component
    of operating income when the work is performed.

Additionally, an estimate of fair value should also include the
    price that marketplace participants are able to receive for
    bearing the uncertainties inherent in these cash flows. However,
    when using discounted cash flow techniques, reliable estimates
    of market premiums may not be obtainable. In the waste industry,
    there is generally not a market for selling the responsibility
    for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations
    independent of selling the landfill in its entirety.
    Accordingly, we do not believe that it is possible to develop a
    methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium. We have
    excluded any such market risk premium from our determination of
    expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations.

Once we have determined the final capping, closure and
    post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time
    of payment and discount those expected future costs back to
    present value. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, we inflated these costs in current dollars until the
    expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 2.5%. We
    discount these costs to present value using the credit-adjusted,
    risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred
    consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in
    expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated
    cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the
    current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the
    historical weighted-average rate of the recorded obligation. As
    a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

each individual asset retirement obligation. The
    weighted-average rate applicable to our asset retirement
    obligations at December 31, 2007 is between 6.00% and
    7.25%, the range of the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount
    rates effective since adopting SFAS No. 143 in 2003.

We record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and
    post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the capacity
    consumed through the current period. The fair value of final
    capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the
    airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the
    expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of
    closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our
    estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire
    landfill and the expected timing of each closure and
    post-closure activity. Because these obligations are measured at
    estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in
    the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure
    and post-closure activities could result in a material change in
    these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We
    assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our
    recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts
    change.

Changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or
    extent of future final capping and closure and post-closure
    activities typically result in both (i) a current
    adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset; and
    (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded
    prospectively over either the remaining capacity of the related
    discrete final capping event or the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace (as defined below) of the landfill. Any
    changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the
    landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our
    amortization policy, which would generally result in
    amortization expense being recognized prospectively over the
    remaining capacity of the final capping event or the remaining
    permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as
    appropriate. Changes in such estimates associated with airspace
    that has been fully utilized result in an adjustment to the
    recorded liability and landfill assets with an immediate
    corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace amortization
    expense.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    adjustments associated with changes in our expectations for the
    timing and cost of future final capping, closure and
    post-closure of fully utilized airspace resulted in
    $17 million, $1 million and $13 million in net
    credits to landfill airspace amortization expense, respectively,
    with the majority of these credits resulting from revised
    estimates associated with final capping changes. In managing our
    landfills, our engineers look for ways to reduce or defer our
    construction costs, including final capping costs. Most of the
    benefit recognized in these years was the result of concerted
    efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our landfills
    allowing us to delay spending for final capping activities,
    landfill expansions that resulted in reduced or deferred final
    capping costs, or completed final capping construction that cost
    less than anticipated.

Interest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure
    liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and
    is recorded as final capping, closure and post-closure expense,
    which is included in “Operating” costs and expenses
    within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Amortization of Landfill Assets

— The
    amortizable basis of a landfill includes (i) amounts
    previously expended and capitalized; (ii) capitalized
    landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs;
    (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs
    required to develop the landfill site to its remaining permitted
    and expansion capacity; and (iv) projected asset retirement
    costs related to landfill final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities.

Amortization is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis,
    applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated
    by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a
    landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding
    asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do not own, but
    operate through operating or lease arrangements, the rate per
    ton is calculated based on the lesser of the contractual term of
    the underlying agreement or the life of the landfill.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

We apply the following guidelines in determining a
    landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:

•

Remaining Permitted Airspace

— Our engineers,
    in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and
    surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted
    airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is
    determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare
    the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill
    topography.

•

Expansion Airspace

— We also include currently
    unpermitted airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include
    airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally
    expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted
    within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received
    within five years. Second, we must believe the success of
    obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the
    following criteria:

•

Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local,
    state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing
    landfill;

•

It is likely that the approvals will be received within the
    normal application and processing time periods for approvals in
    the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located;

•

We have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in
    the expansion plan;

•

There are no significant known technical, legal, community,
    business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could
    impair the success of such expansion;

•

Financial analysis has been completed, and the results
    demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and
    operational impact; and

•

Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and
    post-closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual
    design.

For unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our
    estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the
    expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above.
    These criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers,
    accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles
    to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is
    included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be
    included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if
    these criteria are no longer met, based on the facts and
    circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances,
    continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific
    review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial
    Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 54 landfill sites
    with expansions at December 31, 2007, 18 landfills
    required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of
    the unpermitted airspace. Eight of these landfills required
    approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of a lack of
    community or political support that could impede the expansion
    process. The remaining ten landfills required approval primarily
    due to the permit application processes not meeting the one- or
    five-year requirements, as a result of state-specific permitting
    procedures.

Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is
    determined, an airspace utilization factor, or AUF, is
    established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion
    capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured
    density obtained from previous annual surveys and then adjusted
    to account for settlement. The amount of settlement that is
    forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors
    including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and
    projected waste density, estimated number of years of life
    remaining, depth of underlying waste, and anticipated access to
    moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill
    leachate. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is
    subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering
    group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and
    revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally
    indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater
    later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the
    landfill approaches its highest point under the permit
    requirements.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of
    remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the
    projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset
    retirement costs related to final capping, and closure and
    post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the
    landfill.

After determining the costs and remaining permitted and
    expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the
    per ton rates that will be expensed through landfill
    amortization. We look at factors such as the waste stream,
    geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the
    number of tons necessary to fill the remaining permitted and
    expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We
    then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us
    the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is
    received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton
    amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with
    each final capping event, for assets related to closure and
    post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or
    to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated
    annually, or more often, as significant facts change.

It is possible that actual results, including the amount of
    costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and
    post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success
    of our expansion efforts, could ultimately turn out to be
    significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To
    the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to
    be significantly different than actual results, lower
    profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization
    rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or
    higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the
    opposite occurs. Most significantly, if our belief that we will
    receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is
    determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be
    considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill
    asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If
    it is determined that the likelihood of receiving the expansion
    permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the
    expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

— We are
    subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that
    existed before we acquired a site. Such liabilities include
    potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations,
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs
    directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such
    as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to
    the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with
    environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. We routinely review
    and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our
    estimated cost for the likely remedy based on several estimates
    and assumptions.

We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred based on
    site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and
    evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we
    were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site,
    the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number
    of years we were associated with the site. Next, we review the
    same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
    PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
    either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
    environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
    developed estimates are based on:

•

Management’s judgment and experience in remediating our own
    and unrelated parties’ sites;

•

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
    remediation;

•

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
    responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
    of a specific site; and

•

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs unless the actual
    allocation has been determined.

There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the
    costs associated with the likely remedy of a site. In these
    cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our
    best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a
    better estimate than any other, we use the amounts that are the
    low ends of such ranges in accordance

Accounting for Contingencies

and its Interpretations. If we used the high ends of such
    ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately
    $190 million higher on a discounted basis than the
    $284 million recorded in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements as of December 31, 2007.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation of a
    particular site is inherently difficult and determining the
    method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number
    of assumptions be made. Our ultimate responsibility may differ
    materially from current estimates. It is possible that
    technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the
    results of environmental studies, the inability to identify
    other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the
    settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require
    us to record additional liabilities that could be material.
    Additionally, our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities
    could result in revisions that could cause upward or downward
    adjustments to income from operations. These adjustments could
    also be material in any given period.

Where we believe that both the amount of a particular
    environmental remediation liability and the timing of the
    payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in
    current dollars (by 2.5% at both December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006) until the expected time of payment
    and discount the cost to present value using a risk-free
    discount rate, which is based on the rate for United States
    treasury bonds with a term approximating the weighted average
    period until settlement of the underlying obligation. We
    determine the risk-free discount rate and the inflation rate on
    an annual basis unless interim changes would significantly
    impact our results of operations. As a result of an increase in
    our risk-free discount rate, from 4.25% for 2005 to 4.75% for
    2006, we recorded a $6 million reduction in
    “Operating” expenses during the first quarter of 2006
    and a corresponding decrease in environmental remediation
    liabilities. As a result of a decrease in our risk-free discount
    rate, from 4.75% for 2006 to 4.00% for 2007, we recorded an
    $8 million charge to “Operating” expenses during
    the fourth quarter of 2007 and a corresponding increase in
    environmental remediation liabilities. For remedial liabilities
    that have been discounted, we include interest accretion, based
    on the effective interest method, in “Operating” costs
    and expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    portion of our recorded environmental remediation liabilities
    that has never been subject to inflation or discounting as the
    amounts and timing of payments are not readily determinable was
    $47 million and $55 million at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Had we not discounted any portion of our
    environmental remediation liability, the amount recorded would
    have been increased by $28 million at December 31,
    2007 and $41 million at December 31, 2006.

Property
    and equipment (Exclusive of landfills discussed
    above)

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
    major additions and improvements are capitalized while major
    maintenance activities are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of these assets using
    the straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for our
    depreciable property and equipment. The estimated useful lives
    for significant property and equipment categories are as follows
    (in years):

Useful Lives

Vehicles — excluding rail haul cars

3 to 10

Vehicles — rail haul cars

10 to 20

Machinery and equipment

3 to 30

Buildings and improvements — excluding waste-to-energy
    facilities

5 to 40

Waste-to-energy facilities and related equipment

up to 50

Furniture, fixtures and office equipment

3 to 10

We include capitalized costs associated with developing or
    obtaining internal-use software within furniture, fixtures and
    office equipment. These costs include external direct costs of
    materials and services used in developing or obtaining the
    software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees
    directly associated with the software development project. As of
    December 31, 2007, capitalized costs for software placed in
    service, net of accumulated



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

depreciation, were $40 million. In addition, our furniture,
    fixtures and office equipment includes $81 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and $68 million as of
    December 31, 2006 for costs incurred for software under
    development. This includes $70 million of costs associated
    with the development of our revenue management system. Our
    implementation processes associated with this software
    identified issues with the software that have delayed the
    development and implementation of the system. Based on this
    information, we are currently evaluating the overall
    effectiveness of the software portion of the system and
    re-examining our implementation plan. No impairment of this
    asset has been required through December 31, 2007, although
    there can be no assurances that an impairment may not be
    required in future periods.

When property and equipment are retired, sold or otherwise
    disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
    from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
    results of operations as offsets or increases to operating
    expense for the period.

Leases

We lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our
    business. Our most significant lease obligations are for
    property and equipment specific to our industry, including real
    property operated as a landfill, transfer station or
    waste-to-energy facility and equipment such as compactors. Our
    leases have varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase
    options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other
    obligations that we consider in determining minimum lease
    payments. The leases are classified as either operating leases
    or capital leases, as appropriate.

Operating leases

— The majority of our leases
    are operating leases. This classification generally can be
    attributed to either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease
    payments as a result of real property lease obligations that
    vary based on the volume of waste we receive or process or
    (ii) minimum lease terms that are much shorter than the
    assets’ economic useful lives. Management expects that in
    the normal course of business our operating leases will be
    renewed, replaced by other leases, or replaced with fixed asset
    expenditures. Our rent expense during each of the last three
    years and our future minimum operating lease payments for each
    of the next five years, for which we are contractually obligated
    as of December 31, 2007, are disclosed in Note 10.

Capital leases

— Assets under capital leases
    are capitalized using interest rates appropriate at the
    inception of each lease and are amortized over either the useful
    life of the asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a
    straight-line basis. The present value of the related lease
    payments is recorded as a debt obligation. Our future minimum
    annual capital lease payments are included in our total future
    debt obligations as disclosed in Note 7.

Business
    combinations

We account for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination based on fair value estimates as of the
    date of acquisition. These estimates are revised during the
    allocation period as necessary if, and when, information
    regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and
    quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation
    period generally does not exceed one year. To the extent
    contingencies such as preacquisition environmental matters,
    litigation and related legal fees are resolved or settled during
    the allocation period, such items are included in the revised
    allocation of the purchase price. After the allocation period,
    the effect of changes in such contingencies is included in
    results of operations in the periods in which the adjustments
    are determined.

In certain business combinations, we agree to pay additional
    amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired
    businesses of certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue
    levels, targeted disposal volumes or the issuance of permits for
    expanded landfill airspace. Contingent payments, when incurred,
    are recorded as purchase price adjustments or compensation
    expense, as appropriate, based on the nature of each contingent
    payment. Refer to the

Guarantees

section of Note 10
    for additional information related to these contingent
    obligations.

Assets
    held-for-sale

During our operations review processes, we, from time to time,
    identify under-performing operations. We assess these operations
    for opportunities to improve their performance. A possible
    conclusion of this review may be that offering the related
    assets for sale to others is in our best interests.
    Additionally, we continually review our real estate portfolio
    and identify any surplus property.

We classify these assets as held-for-sale when they meet the
    following criteria: (i) management, having the authority to
    approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the assets;
    (ii) the assets are available for immediate sale in their
    present condition, subject only to conditions that are usual and
    customary for the sale of such assets; (iii) we are
    actively searching for a buyer; (iv) the assets are being
    marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to their
    current fair value; (v) actions necessary to complete the
    plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to
    the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn; and
    (vi) the sale is probable and the transfer is expected to
    qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year.

These assets are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount
    or their fair value less the estimated cost to sell and are
    included within current “Other assets” within our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We continue to review our
    classification of assets held-for-sale to ensure they meet our
    held-for-sale criteria.

Discontinued
    operations

We analyze our operations that have been divested or classified
    as held-for-sale in order to determine if they qualify for
    discontinued operations accounting. Only operations that qualify
    as a component of an entity (“Component”) under
    generally accepted accounting principles can be included in
    discontinued operations. Only Components where we do not have
    significant continuing involvement with the divested operations
    would qualify for discontinued operations accounting. For our
    purposes, continuing involvement would include continuing to
    receive waste at our landfill, waste-to-energy facility or
    recycling facility from a divested hauling operation or transfer
    station or continuing to dispose of waste at a divested landfill
    or transfer station. After completing our analysis at
    December 31, 2007, we determined that the operations that
    qualify for discontinued operations accounting are not material
    to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets

Goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value
    of the net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

, we do not amortize goodwill. As discussed in the

Asset impairments

section below, we assess our goodwill
    for impairment at least annually.

Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts,
    customer lists, covenants not-to-compete, licenses, permits
    (other than landfill permits, as all landfill related intangible
    assets are combined with landfill tangible assets and amortized
    using our landfill amortization policy) and other contracts.
    Other intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized
    using either a 150% declining balance approach or on a
    straight-line basis as we determine appropriate. Customer
    contracts and customer lists are generally amortized over seven
    to ten years. Covenants not-to-compete are amortized over the
    term of the non-compete covenant, which is generally two to five
    years. Licenses, permits and other contracts are amortized over
    the definitive terms of the related agreements. If the
    underlying agreement does not contain definitive terms and the
    useful life is determined to be indefinite, the asset is not
    amortized.

Asset
    impairments

We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If an indication of
    impairment occurs, the asset is reviewed to determine whether
    there has been an impairment. An impairment loss is recorded as
    the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

asset. If significant events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may
    not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by
    comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its
    undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be
    separately and independently identified for a single asset, we
    will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group
    of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flow. If
    the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected
    future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the
    fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.
    Fair value is determined by either an internally developed
    discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset
    group or an actual third-party valuation. If the fair value of
    an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the
    carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in
    the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the
    impairment indicator occurs and is included in the
    “(Income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and
    unusual items” line item in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant
    judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually
    realized. There are other considerations for impairments of
    landfills and goodwill, as described below.

Landfills

— Certain impairment indicators
    require significant judgment and understanding of the waste
    industry when applied to landfill development or expansion
    projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill
    expansion permit application though the expansion permit is
    ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically
    divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining
    permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could
    occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be
    considered indicators of impairment of our landfill assets due
    to the unique nature of the waste industry.

Goodwill

— At least annually, we assess whether
    goodwill is impaired. We assess whether an impairment exists by
    comparing the carrying value of each Group’s goodwill to
    its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is
    determined by deducting the fair value of each Group’s
    identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the
    Group as a whole. We rely on discounted cash flow analysis,
    which requires significant judgments and estimates about the
    future operations of each Group, to develop our estimates of
    fair value. Additional impairment assessments may be performed
    on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in
    circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not,
    the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired.

Restricted
    trust and escrow accounts

As of December 31, 2007, our restricted trust and escrow
    accounts consist principally of (i) funds deposited for
    purposes of settling landfill closure, post-closure and
    environmental remediation obligations; (ii) funds held in
    trust for the construction of various facilities; and
    (iii) funds held in trust for the repayment of our debt
    obligations. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had
    $418 million and $377 million, respectively, of
    restricted trust and escrow accounts, which are primarily
    included in long-term “Other assets” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Closure, post-closure and environmental remediation
    funds

— At several of our landfills, we provide
    financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust
    funds or escrow accounts for purposes of settling closure,
    post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. Balances
    maintained in these trust funds and escrow accounts will
    fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements;
    (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual
    arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of funds for qualifying
    closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities;
    (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills; and
    (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments
    held in the trust fund or escrow accounts.

Tax-exempt bond funds

— We obtain funds from
    the issuance of industrial revenue bonds for the construction of
    collection and disposal facilities and for equipment necessary
    to provide waste management services. Proceeds from these
    arrangements are directly deposited into trust accounts, and we
    do not have the ability to use the funds in regular operating
    activities. Accordingly, these borrowings are excluded from
    financing activities in our Statement of Cash Flows. At the time
    our construction and equipment expenditures have been documented
    and approved by the applicable bond trustee, the funds are
    released and we receive cash. These amounts are reported in the
    Statement of Cash Flows as an investing activity when the cash
    is released from the trust funds. Generally, the funds are fully



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

expended within a few years of the debt issuance. When the debt
    matures, we repay our obligation with cash on hand and the debt
    repayments are included as a financing activity in the Statement
    of Cash Flows.

Debt service funds

— Funds are held in trust to
    meet future principal and interest payments required under
    certain of our tax-exempt project bonds.

Derivative
    financial instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk
    associated with fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices
    and foreign currency exchange rates. We use interest rate swaps
    to maintain a strategic portion of our debt obligations at
    variable, market-driven interest rates. In prior periods, we
    have entered into interest rate derivatives in anticipation of
    our senior note issuances to effectively lock in a fixed
    interest rate. We have entered into commodity derivatives,
    including swaps and options, to mitigate some of the risk
    associated with our WMRA Group’s transactions, which can be
    significantly affected by market prices for recyclable
    commodities. Foreign currency exchange rate derivatives are
    often used to hedge our exposure to changes in exchange rates
    for anticipated cash transactions between WM Holdings and
    its Canadian subsidiaries.

We obtain current valuations of our interest rate hedging
    instruments from third-party pricing models to account for the
    fair value of outstanding interest rate derivatives. We estimate
    the future prices of commodity fiber products based upon traded
    exchange market prices and broker price quotations to derive the
    current fair value of commodity derivatives. The fair value of
    our foreign currency exchange rate derivatives is based on
    quoted market prices. The estimated fair values of derivatives
    used to hedge risks fluctuate over time and should be viewed in
    relation to the underlying hedged transaction and the overall
    management of our exposure to fluctuations in the underlying
    risks. The fair value of derivatives is included in other
    current assets, other long-term assets, accrued liabilities or
    other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. Any ineffectiveness
    present in either fair value or cash flow hedges is recognized
    immediately in earnings without offset. There was no significant
    ineffectiveness in 2007, 2006 or 2005.

•

Cash flow hedges

— The effective portion of
    those derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for accounting
    purposes is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive
    income” within the equity section of our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Upon termination, the associated balance in
    other comprehensive income is amortized to earnings as the
    hedged cash flows occur.

•

Fair value hedges

— The offsetting amounts for
    those derivatives designated as fair value hedges for accounting
    purposes are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of
    the hedged items. Upon termination, this carrying value
    adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of
    the hedged item.

As of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the net fair value
    and earnings impact of our commodity and foreign currency
    derivatives were immaterial to our financial position and
    results of operations. As further discussed in Note 7, our
    use of interest rate derivatives to manage our fixed to floating
    rate position has had a material impact on our operating cash
    flows, carrying value of debt and interest expense during these
    periods.

Self-insurance
    reserves and recoveries

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and
    workers’ compensation insurance programs. The exposure for
    unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but
    not reported losses, generally is estimated with the assistance
    of external actuaries and by factoring in pending claims and
    historical trends and data. The gross estimated liability
    associated with settling unpaid claims is included in
    “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets if expected to be settled within one year, or otherwise
    is included in long-term “Other liabilities.”
    Estimated insurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities
    are reflected as current “Other receivables” or
    long-term “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is
    probable.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Foreign
    currency

We have significant operations in Canada. The functional
    currency of our Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars. The
    assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated
    to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance
    sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate during the
    period. The resulting translation difference is reflected as a
    component of comprehensive income.

Revenue
    recognition

Our revenues are generated from the fees we charge for waste
    collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services and the
    sale of recycled commodities, electricity and steam. The fees
    charged for our services are generally defined in our service
    agreements and vary based on contract specific terms such as
    frequency of service, weight, volume and the general market
    factors influencing a region’s rates. We generally
    recognize revenue as services are performed or products are
    delivered. For example, revenue typically is recognized as waste
    is collected, tons are received at our landfills or transfer
    stations, recycling commodities are delivered or as kilowatts
    are delivered to a customer by a waste-to-energy facility or
    independent power production plant.

We bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services
    include, among others, certain residential contracts that are
    billed on a quarterly basis and equipment rentals. These advance
    billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as
    revenue in the period service is provided.

Capitalized
    interest

We capitalize interest on certain projects under development,
    including internal-use software and landfill expansion projects,
    and on certain assets under construction, including operating
    landfills and waste-to-energy facilities. During 2007, 2006 and
    2005, total interest costs were $543 million,
    $563 million and $505 million, respectively, of which
    $22 million for 2007, $18 million for 2006 and
    $9 million for 2005, were capitalized, primarily for
    landfill construction costs. The capitalization of interest for
    operating landfills is based on the costs incurred on discrete
    landfill cell construction projects that are expected to exceed
    $500,000 and require over 60 days to construct. In addition
    to the direct cost of the cell construction project, the
    calculation of capitalized interest includes an allocated
    portion of the common landfill site costs. The common landfill
    site costs include the development costs of a landfill project
    or the purchase price of an operating landfill, and the ongoing
    infrastructure costs benefiting the landfill over its useful
    life. These costs are amortized to expense in a manner
    consistent with other landfill site costs. Interest capitalized
    in 2005 included fewer projects on which interest was
    capitalized and an adjustment in the second quarter of 2005
    reducing amounts previously capitalized to a large capital
    project.

Income
    taxes

The Company is subject to income tax in the United States,
    Canada and Puerto Rico. Current tax obligations associated with
    our provision for income taxes are reflected in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of “Accrued
    liabilities,” and the deferred tax obligations are
    reflected in “Deferred income taxes.”

Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the
    financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The
    deferred income tax provision represents the change during the
    reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions.
    Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards
    and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant
    judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of
    deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when,
    despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
    supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged
    and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change,
    we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing
    authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have
    been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax
    expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elected
    this accounting policy, which is a continuation of our
    historical policy, in connection with our adoption of
    FIN 48.

Contingent
    liabilities

We estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with
    respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. We are party to pending or threatened
    legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters in various
    jurisdictions. It is not always possible to predict the outcome
    of litigation, as it is subject to many uncertainties.
    Additionally, it is not always possible for management to make a
    meaningful estimate of the potential loss or range of loss
    associated with such litigation.

Supplemental
    cash flow information

Non-cash investing and financing activities are excluded from
    the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, non-cash activities
    included proceeds from tax-exempt borrowings, net of principal
    payments made directly from trust funds, of $144 million,
    $157 million and $201 million, respectively.

On December 15, 2005, we declared our first quarterly cash
    dividend for 2006. The first quarter 2006 dividend was $0.22 per
    common share and was paid on March 24, 2006 to stockholders
    of record on March 6, 2006. As of December 31, 2005,
    $122 million had been accrued for this dividend
    declaration. As the dividend payments did not occur until March
    2006 they were excluded from our “Net cash used in
    financing activities” in our Consolidated Statement of Cash
    Flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. This dividend
    payment was reflected as “Cash dividends” in our
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

At several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by

    for purposes of settling closure, post-closure and environmental
    remediation obligations. The fair value of these escrow accounts
    and trust funds was $231 million at December 31, 2007
    and $219 million at December 31, 2006, and is
    primarily included as long-term “Other assets” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances maintained in these
    restricted trust funds and escrow accounts will fluctuate based
    on (i) changes in statutory requirements; (ii) future
    deposits made to comply with contractual arrangements;
    (iii) the ongoing use of funds for qualifying closure,
    post-closure and environmental remediation activities;
    (iv) acquisitions or divestitures of landfills; and

Revolving credit facility

— On August 17,
    2006, WMI entered into a five-year, $2.4 billion revolving
    credit facility, replacing the $2.4 billion syndicated
    revolving credit facility that would have expired in October
    2009. This facility provides us with credit capacity to be used
    for either cash borrowings or to support letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2007, we had $300 million of outstanding
    borrowings and $1,437 million of letters of credit issued
    and supported by the facility. Our unused and available credit
    capacity of the facility was $663 million as of
    December 31, 2007. The borrowings outstanding at
    December 31, 2007 mature in the first quarter of 2008. In
    January 2008, we repaid $50 million of the outstanding
    borrowings with available cash. We currently intend to refinance
    the remaining outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis.
    Accordingly, $250 million of this outstanding debt
    obligation has been reflected as long-term in our
    December 31, 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Letter of credit facilities

— We have a
    $350 million letter of credit facility that matures in
    December 2008 and three letter of credit and term loan
    agreements for an aggregate of $295 million maturing at
    various points from 2008 through 2013. These facilities are
    currently being used to back letters of credit issued to support
    our bonding and financial assurance needs. Our letters of credit
    generally have terms providing for automatic renewal after one
    year. In the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of
    credit, the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit

provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining
    term of the respective agreement or facility. Through
    December 31, 2007, we had not experienced any unreimbursed
    draws on letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2007, no borrowings were outstanding
    under our letter of credit facilities, and we had unused and
    available credit capacity of $1 million under the
    facilities. The following table summarizes our outstanding
    letters of credit (in millions) categorized by each facility
    outstanding at December 31:

Canadian Credit Facility

— In November 2005,
    Waste Management of Canada Corporation, one of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, entered into a three-year credit facility
    agreement with an initial credit capacity of up to Canadian
    $410 million. The agreement was entered into to facilitate
    WMI’s repatriation of accumulated earnings and capital from
    its Canadian subsidiaries, which is discussed in Note 8. In
    December 2007, we amended the agreement to increase the
    available capacity, which had been reduced to Canadian
    $305 million due to debt repayments, to Canadian
    $340 million, extend the maturity date to November 2012 and
    add an uncommitted option to increase the capacity by an
    additional Canadian $25 million.

As of December 31, 2007, we had US $342 million of
    principal (US $336 million net of discount) outstanding
    under this credit facility. Advances under the facility do not
    accrue interest during their terms. Accordingly, the proceeds we
    initially received were for the principal amount of the advances
    net of the total interest obligation due for the term of the
    advance, and the debt was initially recorded based on the net
    proceeds received. The advances have a weighted average
    effective interest rate of 5.3% at December 31, 2007, which
    is being amortized to interest expense with a corresponding
    increase in our recorded debt obligation using the effective
    interest method. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    we increased the carrying value of the debt for the recognition
    of $15 million of interest expense. A total of
    $36 million of advances under the facility matured during
    2007 and were repaid with available cash. Accounting for changes
    in the Canadian currency translation rate increased the carrying
    value of these borrowings by $49 million during 2007.

Our outstanding advances mature less than one year from the date
    of issuance, but may be renewed under the terms of the facility,
    which matures in November 2012. We currently expect to repay a
    portion of our borrowings under the facility with available cash
    and refinance the remaining borrowings. Accordingly,
    $281 million of these borrowings are classified as
    long-term in our December 31, 2007 Consolidated Balance
    Sheet based on our intent and ability to refinance the
    obligations under the terms of the facility. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had expected to repay our borrowings
    under the facility within one year with available cash and these
    borrowings were classified as current in our December 31,
    2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Senior notes

— On October 1, 2007,
    $300 million of 7.125% senior notes matured and were
    repaid with available cash. We have $244 million of
    8.75% senior notes that become callable by us in May 2008
    and $386 million of 6.5% senior notes that mature in
    November 2008. We are currently evaluating our repayment options
    associated with these obligations, but currently expect to
    refinance them on a long-term basis. The $244 million of
    callable senior notes are classified as long-term as of
    December 31, 2007 based on the terms of their scheduled
    maturity, which is May 2018. Approximately $310 million of
    our $386 million senior notes that mature in November 2008
    is classified as long-term as of December 31, 2007 based on
    our intent and ability to refinance the obligation on a
    long-term basis.

Tax-exempt bonds

— We actively issue tax-exempt
    bonds as a means of accessing low-cost financing for capital
    expenditures. We issued $145 million of tax-exempt bonds
    during 2007. The proceeds from these debt issuances may only be
    used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised,
    which is generally to finance



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

expenditures for landfill construction and development,
    equipment, vehicles and facilities in support of our operations.
    Proceeds from bond issues are held in trust until such time as
    we incur qualified expenditures, at which time we are reimbursed
    from the trust funds. We issue both fixed and floating rate
    obligations. Interest rates on floating rate bonds are re-set on
    a weekly basis and the underlying bonds are supported by letters
    of credit. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    $52 million of our tax-exempt bonds matured and were repaid
    with either available cash or debt service funds.

As of December 31, 2007, $192 million of fixed rate
    tax-exempt bonds are subject to repricing within the next twelve
    months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the
    re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can
    be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not
    backed by letters of credit supported by our revolving credit
    facility that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of
    a failed re-offering and are, therefore, considered a current
    obligation for financial reporting purposes. However, these
    bonds have been classified as long-term in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007. The classification
    of these obligations as long-term was based upon our intent to
    refinance the borrowings with other long-term financings in the
    event of a failed re-offering and our ability, in the event
    other sources of long-term financing are not available, to use
    our five-year revolving credit facility.

In addition, as of December 31, 2007, we have
    $696 million of tax-exempt bonds that are remarketed either
    daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a
    variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket
    the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us.
    These bonds are supported by letters of credit guaranteeing
    repayment of the bonds in this event. We classified these
    borrowings as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 2007 because the borrowings are supported by
    letters of credit issued under our five-year revolving credit
    facility, which is long-term.

Tax-exempt project bonds

— Tax-exempt project
    bonds have been used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the
    development of waste-to-energy facilities. These facilities are
    integral to the local communities they serve, and, as such, are
    supported by long-term contracts with multiple municipalities.
    The bonds generally have periodic amortizations that are
    supported by the cash flow of each specific facility being
    financed. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we
    repaid $61 million of our tax-exempt project bonds with
    either available cash or debt service funds. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had $46 million of tax-exempt
    project bonds that are remarketed either daily or weekly by a
    remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If
    the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the
    remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds are
    supported by letters of credit guaranteeing repayment of the
    bonds in this event. We classified these borrowings as long-term
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007
    because the borrowings are supported by letters of credit issued
    under our five-year revolving credit facility, which is
    long-term.

Capital leases and other

— The decrease in
    our capital leases and other debt obligations in 2007 is
    primarily related to the repayment of various borrowings upon
    their scheduled maturities.

Scheduled debt and capital lease payments

— The
    schedule of anticipated debt and capital lease payments
    (including the current portion) for the next five years is
    presented below (in millions). Our recorded debt and capital
    lease obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with
    discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate
    hedging activities, which have been excluded here because they
    will not result in cash payments.

Secured debt

— Our debt balances are generally
    unsecured, except for $201 million of the tax-exempt
    project bonds outstanding at December 31, 2007 that were
    issued by certain subsidiaries within our Wheelabrator Group.
    These bonds are secured by the related subsidiaries’ assets
    that have a carrying value of $447 million and the related
    subsidiaries’ future revenue. Additionally, our
    consolidated variable interest entities have $13 million of
    outstanding borrowings that are collateralized by certain of
    their assets. These assets have a carrying value of
    $271 million as of December 31, 2007. See Note 19
    for further discussion.

Debt
    Covenants

Our revolving credit facility and certain other financing
    agreements contain financial covenants. The most restrictive of
    these financial covenants are contained in our revolving credit
    facility. The following table summarizes the requirements of
    these financial covenants and the results of the calculation, as
    defined by the revolving credit facility:

Our revolving credit facility and senior notes also contain
    certain restrictions intended to monitor our level of
    indebtedness, types of investments and net worth. We monitor our
    compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they
    significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or
    financing arrangements typical for our business. As of
    December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants
    and restrictions under all of our debt agreements.

Interest
    rate swaps

We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio largely
    by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position
    of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2007,
    the interest payments on $2.1 billion of our fixed rate
    debt have been swapped to variable rates, allowing us to
    maintain approximately 66% of our debt at fixed interest rates
    and approximately 34% of our debt at variable interest rates. We
    do not use interest rate derivatives for trading or speculative
    purposes. Our significant interest rate swap agreements that
    were outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 are set
    forth in the table below (dollars in millions):

(a)

At December 31, 2007, $33 million (on a pre-tax basis)
    of the carrying value of debt associated with terminated swap
    agreements is scheduled to be reclassified as a credit to
    interest expense over the next twelve months. Approximately
    $37 million (on a pre-tax basis) of the December 31,
    2006 balance was reclassified into earnings during 2007.

Interest rate swap agreements increased net interest expense by
    $11 million and $4 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and reduced net
    interest expense by $39 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The significant decline in the benefit
    recognized as a result of our interest rate swap agreements is
    largely attributable to the increase in short-term market
    interest rates, which drive our periodic interest obligations
    under these agreements. The significant terms of the interest
    rate contracts and the underlying debt instruments are identical
    and therefore no ineffectiveness has been realized.

Interest
    rate locks

In the past, we have entered into cash flow hedges to secure
    underlying interest rates in anticipation of senior note
    issuances. These hedging agreements resulted in a deferred loss,
    net of taxes, of $24 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $28 million at December 31, 2006, which is included in
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” As of
    December 31, 2007, $6 million (on a pre-tax basis) is
    scheduled to be reclassified into interest expense over the next
    twelve months.

The comparability of our reported income taxes for the reported
    periods has been significantly affected by increases in our
    income before income taxes, tax audit settlements and
    non-conventional fuel tax credits, which are discussed in more
    detail below. For financial reporting purposes, income before
    income taxes showing domestic and foreign sources was as follows
    (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005:

balances; (ii) a reduction in the valuation allowance
    related to the expected utilization of state net operating loss
    and credit carryforwards; and (iii) the 2005 repatriation
    of net accumulated earnings and capital from certain of our
    Canadian subsidiaries in accordance with the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004. The impacts of these items on our reported
    income taxes and our effective tax rate are discussed in more
    detail below.

Tax audit settlements

— The Company and its
    subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States and
    Puerto Rico, as well as various state and local jurisdictions
    and Canada. We are currently under audit by the IRS and from
    time to time we are audited by other taxing authorities. Our
    audits are in various stages of completion.

During 2007, we settled an IRS audit for the tax years 2004 and
    2005 and various state tax audits, resulting in a reduction in
    income tax expense of $40 million, or $0.08 per diluted
    share. Our 2007 net income also increased by
    $1 million due to interest income recognized from audit
    settlements. During 2006 we completed the IRS audit for the
    years 2002 and 2003. The settlement of the IRS audit, as well as
    other state and foreign tax audit matters, resulted in a
    reduction in income tax expense (excluding the effects of
    related interest income) of $149 million, or $0.27 per
    diluted share, for 2006. Our 2006 net income also increased
    by $14 million, or $9 million net of tax, principally
    due to interest income from audit settlements. The IRS audits
    for the tax years 1989 to 2001 were completed during 2005,
    resulting in net tax benefits of $398 million, or $0.70 per
    diluted share. The reduction in income taxes recognized as a
    result of these settlements is primarily due to the associated
    reduction in our long-term accrued tax liabilities. Our recorded
    liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions are
    discussed below.

We are currently in the examination phase of an IRS audit for
    the years 2006 and 2007, and expect this audit to be completed
    within the next 12 months. Audits associated with state and
    local jurisdictions date back to 1999 and Canadian examinations
    date back to 2002.

Non-conventional fuel tax credits

— The impact
    of non-conventional fuel tax credits on our effective tax rate
    has been derived from our investments in two coal-based,
    synthetic fuel production facilities and our landfill
    gas-to-energy projects. The fuel generated from the facilities
    and our landfill gas-to-energy projects qualified for tax
    credits through 2007 under Section 45K of the Internal
    Revenue Code.

The tax credits are subject to a phase-out if the price of crude
    oil exceeds an annual average price threshold determined by the
    Internal Revenue Service. The IRS has not yet published the
    phase-out percentage that must be applied to Section 45K
    tax credits generated in 2007. Accordingly, we have used market
    information for oil prices to estimate that we expect 69% of
    Section 45K tax credits generated in 2007 to be phased-out.
    The IRS establishment of the final phase-out of Section 45K
    credits generated during 2007 could further impact the
    Section 45K tax benefits we recognized for 2007. Any
    subsequent adjustment to the amount of realizable
    Section 45K credits will be reflected in our 2008
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2006, we had estimated that 36% of
    Section 45K tax credits generated during 2006 would be
    phased out. On April 4, 2007, the IRS established the final
    phase-out of Section 45K credits generated during 2006 at
    approximately 33%. We did not experience any phase-out of
    Section 45K tax credits in 2005.

Our minority ownership interests in the facilities result in the
    recognition of our pro-rata share of the facilities’
    losses, the amortization of our investments, and additional
    expense associated with other estimated obligations all being
    recorded as “Equity in net losses of unconsolidated
    entities” within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    We are required to pay for tax credits based on the
    facilities’ production, regardless of whether or not a
    phase-out of the tax credits is anticipated. Amounts paid to the
    facilities for which we do not ultimately realize a tax benefit
    are refundable to us, subject to certain limitations.

(a)

The comparison of the impacts of our investments in the
    facilities during the periods presented have been significantly
    affected by the phase-out of 69% of Section 45K tax credits
    in 2007 and 36% in 2006. In addition, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, our “Equity in net losses of
    unconsolidated entities” was reduced by a cumulative
    adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2006, which was
    necessary to appropriately reflect our life-to-date obligations
    to fund the costs of operating the facilities and the value of
    our investment. We determined that the recognition of the
    cumulative adjustment was not material to our financial
    statements presented herein. Equity losses for our estimate of
    contractual obligations associated with the facilities’
    operations and associated tax benefits were also relatively
    lower in 2006 due to the suspension of operations of the
    facilities from May 2006 to late September 2006.

(b)

The benefit from income taxes attributable to the facilities
    includes tax credits of $37 million, $47 million and
    $99 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

The tax credits generated by our landfills are provided by our
    Renewable Energy Program, under which we develop, operate and
    promote the beneficial use of landfill gas. Our recorded taxes
    include benefits of $13 million, $24 million, and
    $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, from tax credits generated by our
    landfill gas-to-energy projects.

Effective state tax rate change

— Our estimated
    effective state tax rate declined during 2006 and 2005,
    resulting in a net benefit of $9 million and
    $16 million, respectively, related to the revaluation of
    net accumulated deferred tax liabilities. Our state estimated
    effective tax rate did not change in 2007; therefore no
    revaluation of net accumulated deferred tax liabilities was
    necessary in the current reporting period.

Canada statutory tax rate change

— During 2007,
    the Canadian federal government enacted tax rate reductions,
    which resulted in a $30 million tax benefit for the
    revaluation of our deferred tax balances. During 2006, both the
    Canadian federal government and several provinces enacted tax
    rate reductions. The revaluation of our deferred tax balances
    for these rate changes resulted in a $20 million tax
    benefit for the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally,
    during 2005 a provincial tax rate change in Quebec resulted in
    additional income tax expense of $4 million.

Repatriation of earnings in foreign
    subsidiaries

— The American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004 allowed U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from
    their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate during 2005. We
    repatriated net accumulated earnings and capital from certain of
    our Canadian subsidiaries in accordance with this provision,
    which were previously accounted for as permanently reinvested in
    accordance with APB Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes — Special Areas

. During 2005, our
    Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a
    domestic reinvestment plan under which we repatriated
    $496 million of our accumulated foreign earnings and
    capital through cash on hand as well as debt borrowings. During
    2005, we accrued $34 million in tax expense for these
    repatriations. The repatriation of earnings from our Canadian
    subsidiaries increased our 2005 effective tax rate by
    approximately 3.1%, which has been reflected as a component of
    the “Tax rate differential on foreign income” line
    item of the effective tax rate reconciliation provided above.
    During 2006, we repatriated an



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

additional $12 million of our accumulated foreign earnings
    resulting in an increase in tax expense of $3 million. No
    additional foreign earnings were repatriated during 2007.

At December 31, 2007, remaining unremitted earnings in
    foreign operations were approximately $400 million, which
    are considered permanently invested and, therefore, no provision
    for U.S. income taxes has been accrued for these unremitted
    earnings.

Deferred
    tax assets (liabilities)

The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at
    December 31 are as follows (in millions):

At December 31, 2007 we had $27 million of federal net
    operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, $2.0 billion of
    state NOL carryforwards, and $13 million of Canadian NOL
    carryforwards. The federal and state NOL carryforwards have
    expiration dates through the year 2027. The Canadian NOL
    carryforwards have the following expiry: $11 million in
    2009 and $2 million in 2015. In addition, we have
    $42 million of state tax credit carryforwards at
    December 31, 2007.

We have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in
    realizing the benefit of tax loss and credit carryforwards and
    other deferred tax assets. While we expect to realize the
    deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances, changes in
    estimates of future taxable income or in tax laws may alter this
    expectation. The valuation allowance decreased $120 million
    in 2007. We realized a $9 million state tax benefit due to
    a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the expected
    utilization of state NOL and credit carryforwards. The remaining
    reduction in our valuation allowance was offset by changes in
    our gross deferred tax assets due to changes in state NOL and
    credit carryforwards and our adoption of FIN 48.

Liabilities
    for uncertain tax positions

As discussed in Note 2, we adopted FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1

effective January 1, 2007. As a result of both of these
    adoptions, we recognized, as a cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle, a $28 million increase in our
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, a $32 million
    increase in our non-current deferred tax assets and a
    $4 million increase in our beginning retained earnings.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Upon adoption of FIN 48 and FSP

No. 48-1,

our income tax liabilities as of January 1, 2007 included a
    total of $101 million for unrecognized tax benefits and
    $16 million of related accrued interest. A reconciliation
    of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits,
    including accrued interest, is as follows (in millions):

$


These liabilities are primarily included as a component of
    long-term “Other liabilities” in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate
    that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash
    within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2007,
    $72 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized in
    future periods, would impact our effective tax rate.

We recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in tax expense. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recognized
    approximately $7 million, $7 million and
    $18 million, respectively, of such interest expense as a
    component of our “Provision for (benefit from) income
    taxes” We had approximately $13 million and
    $16 million of accrued interest in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We do
    not have any accrued liabilities or expense for penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

We anticipate that approximately $29 million of liabilities
    for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, and
    $8 million of related deferred tax assets may be reversed
    within the next 12 months. The anticipated reversals are
    primarily related to state tax items, none of which are
    material, and are expected to result from audit settlements or
    the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Defined contribution plans —

Our Waste
    Management Retirement Savings Plan covers employees (except
    those working subject to collective bargaining agreements, which
    do not provide for coverage under such plans) following a

90-day

waiting period after hire. Eligible employees may contribute as
    much as 25% of their annual compensation under the Savings Plan.
    All employee contributions are subject to annual contribution
    limitations established by the IRS. Under the Savings Plan, we
    match, in cash, 100% of employee contributions on the first 3%
    of their eligible compensation and match 50% of employee
    contributions on the next 3% of their eligible compensation,
    resulting in a maximum match of 4.5%. Both employee and company
    contributions vest immediately. Charges to “Operating”
    and “Selling, general and administrative” expenses for
    our defined contribution plans were $54 million in 2007,
    $51 million in 2006 and $48 million in 2005.

Defined benefit plans —

Certain of the
    Company’s subsidiaries sponsor pension plans that cover
    employees not covered by the Savings Plan. These employees are
    members of collective bargaining units. In addition,
    Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary,
    sponsors a pension plan for its former executives and former
    Board members. The combined benefit obligation of these pension
    plans is $63 million as of December 31, 2007. These
    plans have approximately $53 million of plan assets as of
    December 31, 2007.

In addition, Waste Management Holdings, Inc. and certain of its
    subsidiaries provided post-retirement health care and other
    benefits to eligible employees. In conjunction with our
    acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998, we



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

limited participation in these plans to participating retired
    employees as of December 31, 1998. The unfunded benefit
    obligation for these plans was $58 million at
    December 31, 2007.

Our accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension
    and other post-retirement plans are $68 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and are included as a component of
    “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

In addition, certain of our subsidiaries participate in various
    multi-employer employee benefit and pension plans covering union
    employees not covered under other pension plans. These
    multi-employer plans are generally defined contribution plans.
    Specific benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not
    negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.
    Additionally, we have one instance of a site-specific plan for
    employees not covered under other plans. The projected benefit
    obligation, plan assets and unfunded liability of the
    multi-employer pension plans and the site specific plan are not
    material. Contributions of $33 million in 2007,
    $37 million in 2006 and $38 million in 2005 were
    charged to operations for those subsidiaries’ defined
    benefit and contribution plans.

10.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Financial instruments

— We have obtained
    letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies and
    have established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to
    support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill
    closure and post-closure requirements, environmental
    remediation, and other obligations.

Historically, our revolving credit facilities have been used to
    obtain letters of credit to support our bonding and financial
    assurance needs. We also have letter of credit and term loan
    agreements and a letter of credit facility that were established
    to provide us with additional sources of capacity from which we
    may obtain letters of credit. These facilities and agreements
    are discussed further in Note 7. We obtain surety bonds and
    insurance policies from two entities in which we have a
    non-controlling financial interest. We also obtain insurance
    from a wholly-owned insurance company, the sole business of
    which is to issue policies for the parent holding company and
    its other subsidiaries, to secure such performance obligations.
    In those instances where our use of captive insurance is not
    allowed, we generally have available alternative bonding
    mechanisms.

Because virtually no claims have been made against the financial
    instruments we use to support our obligations, and considering
    our current financial position, management does not expect that
    any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty
    in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for
    our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks
    of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity,
    we continue to evaluate various options to access cost-effective
    sources of financial assurance.

Insurance

— We carry insurance coverage for
    protection of our assets and operations from certain risks
    including automobile liability, general liability, real and
    personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’
    and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability and
    other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our
    exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to
    the per incident deductible under the related insurance policy.
    Our exposure, however, could increase if our insurers were
    unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.

We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to
    our automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation
    insurance programs. For our self-insured retentions, the
    exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including
    incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial
    valuation and internal estimates. The estimated accruals for
    these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences or
    loss development significantly differ from the assumptions used.
    As of December 31, 2007, our general liability,
    workers’ compensation and auto liability insurance programs
    carry self-insurance exposures of up to $2.5 million,
    $1.5 million and $1 million per incident,
    respectively. Effective January 1, 2008, we increased the
    per incident deductible of our worker’s compensation
    insurance program to $5 million. Self-insurance claims
    reserves acquired as part of our acquisition of WM Holdings
    in July 1998 were discounted at 4.0% at December 31, 2007
    and 4.65% at December 31, 2006. The

Amounts reported as estimated insurance recoveries are related
    to both paid and unpaid claims liabilities.

For the 14 months ended January 1, 2000, we insured
    certain risks, including auto, general liability and
    workers’ compensation, with Reliance National Insurance
    Company, whose parent filed for bankruptcy in June 2001. In
    October 2001, the parent and certain of its subsidiaries,
    including Reliance National Insurance Company, were placed in
    liquidation. We believe that because of probable recoveries from
    the liquidation, currently estimated to be $18 million, it
    is unlikely that events relating to Reliance will have a
    material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property,
    environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Operating leases

— Rental expense for leased
    properties was $135 million, $122 million and
    $129 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    These amounts primarily include rents under operating leases.
    Minimum contractual payments due during each of the next five
    years for our operating lease obligations are noted below (in
    millions):






$ 87

$


$


$


$


Our minimum contractual payments for lease agreements during
    future periods is significantly less than current year rent
    expense because our significant lease agreements at landfills
    have variable terms based either on a percentage of revenue or a
    rate per ton of waste received.

Other commitments

— We have the following
    unconditional obligations:

•

Share Repurchases

— In November 2007, we
    entered into a plan under SEC

Rule 10b5-1

to effect market purchases of our common stock during the first
    quarter of 2008. See Note 14 for additional information
    related to this agreement.

•

Fuel Supply

— We have purchase agreements
    expiring at various dates through 2011 that require us to
    purchase minimum amounts of waste and conventional fuels at our
    independent power production plants. These fuel supplies are
    used to produce electricity for sale to electric utilities,
    which is generally subject to



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

the terms and conditions of long-term contracts. Our purchase
    agreements have been established based on the plants’
    anticipated fuel supply needs to meet the demands of our
    customers under these long-term electricity sale contracts.
    Under our fuel supply take-or-pay contracts, we are generally
    obligated to pay for a minimum amount of waste or conventional
    fuel at a stated rate even if such quantities are not required
    in our operations.

•

Disposal

— We have several agreements expiring
    at various dates through 2024 that require us to dispose of a
    minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under
    these put-or-pay agreements, we are required to pay for the
    agreed upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of
    tons placed at the facilities.

•

Waste Paper

— We are party to a waste paper
    purchase agreement that requires us to purchase a minimum number
    of tons of waste paper. The cost per ton we pay is based on
    market prices plus the cost of delivery to our customers. We
    currently expect to fulfill our purchase obligation in 2012.

•

Royalties

— At some of our landfills, we are
    required to make minimum royalty payments to the prior land
    owners, lessors or host communities where the landfills are
    located. Our obligations expire at various dates through 2023.
    Although we have an obligation to make minimum payments, actual
    payments are based on per ton rates for waste received at the
    landfill and are significantly higher.

•

Property

— From time to time, we make
    commitments to purchase assets that we expect to use in our
    operations. We are currently party to an agreement to purchase a
    corporate aircraft to replace an existing aircraft, the lease
    for which is expiring in 2010. The agreement requires that we
    make installment payments between now and delivery, expected in
    2010, based on the total purchase price for the aircraft.

Our unconditional obligations are established in the ordinary
    course of our business and are structured in a manner that
    provides us with access to important resources at competitive,
    market-driven rates. Our actual future obligations under these
    outstanding agreements are generally quantity driven, and, as a
    result, our associated financial obligations are not fixed as of
    December 31, 2007. We currently expect the products and
    services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the
    needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect
    these established arrangements to materially impact our future
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees

— We have entered into the following
    guarantee agreements associated with our operations:

•

As of December 31, 2007, WM Holdings has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior
    indebtedness, which matures through 2032. WMI has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed all of the senior indebtedness of
    WM Holdings, which matures through 2026. Performance under
    these guarantee agreements would be required if either party
    defaulted on their respective obligations. No additional
    liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees because the
    underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. See Note 22 for further information.

WMI and WM Holdings have guaranteed the tax-exempt bonds
    and other debt obligations of their subsidiaries. If a
    subsidiary fails to meet its obligations associated with its
    debt agreements as they come due, WMI or WM Holdings will
    be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No
    additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees
    because the underlying obligations are reflected in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 for information
    related to the balances and maturities of our tax-exempt bonds.

•

We have guaranteed certain financial obligations of
    unconsolidated entities. The related obligations, which mature
    through 2020, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of December 31, 2007, our maximum future
    payments associated with these guarantees are approximately
    $12 million. We do not believe that it is likely that we
    will be required to perform under these guarantees.

•

WM Holdings has guaranteed all reimbursement obligations of
    WMI under its $350 million letter of credit facility and
    $295 million letter of credit and term loan agreements.
    Under those facilities, WMI must reimburse the entities funding
    the facilities for any draw on a letter of credit supported by
    the facilities. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    $644 million in outstanding letters of credit under these
    facilities.

•

In connection with the $350 million letter of credit
    facility, WMI and WM Holdings guaranteed the interest rate
    swaps entered into by the entity funding the letter of credit
    facility. The probability of loss for the guarantees was
    determined to be remote and the fair value of the guarantees is
    immaterial to our financial position and results of operations.

•

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market value of
    certain homeowners’ properties that are adjacent to certain
    of our landfills. These guarantee agreements extend over the
    life of the respective landfill. Under these agreements, we
    would be responsible for the difference between the sale value
    and the guaranteed market value of the homeowners’
    properties, if any. Generally, it is not possible to determine
    the contingent obligation associated with these guarantees, but
    we do not believe that these contingent obligations will have a
    material effect on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

•

We have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested
    assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of
    our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items
    that are currently recorded as obligations, we do not believe
    that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations
    associated with these indemnities. Additionally, under certain
    of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional
    consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial
    targets are achieved post-closing. The costs associated with any
    additional consideration requirements are accounted for as
    incurred.

•

WMI and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial
    and general operating obligations of certain of their
    subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual
    obligations as they come due, the guarantor has an unconditional
    obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has
    been recorded for service, financial or general operating
    guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are
    properly accounted for as costs of operations as services are
    provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No
    additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees
    because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly
    accounted for as operating or capital leases, as appropriate.

We currently do not believe it is reasonably likely that we
    would be called upon to perform under these guarantees and do
    not believe that any of the obligations would have a material
    effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Environmental matters

— Our business is
    intrinsically connected with the protection of the environment.
    As such, a significant portion of our operating costs and
    capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of
    environmental protection. Such costs may increase in the future
    as a result of legislation or regulation. However, we generally
    do not believe that increases in environmental regulation
    negatively affect our business, because such regulations
    increase the demand for our services, and we have the resources
    and experience to manage environmental risk.

We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to
    the protection of the environment. Under current laws and
    regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
    caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that
    existed before we acquired a site. Such liabilities include
    potentially responsible party , or PRP, investigations,
    settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs
    directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such
    as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to
    the remedy.

Estimating our degree of responsibility for remediation of a
    particular site is inherently difficult and determining the
    method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number
    of assumptions be made. Our ultimate responsibility may differ
    materially from current estimates. It is possible that
    technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the
    results of environmental studies, the inability to identify
    other PRPs, the inability of



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

other PRPs to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities,
    or other factors could require us to record additional
    liabilities that could be material. There can sometimes be a
    range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with the
    likely remedy of a site. In these cases, we use the amount
    within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If no
    amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any
    other, we use the amounts that are the low ends of such ranges
    in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies

, and its interpretations. If we used the high
    ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be
    approximately $190 million higher than the
    $284 million recorded in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements as of December 31, 2007. Our ongoing review of
    our remediation liabilities could result in revisions that could
    cause upward or downward adjustments to income from operations.
    These adjustments could also be material in any given period.

As of December 31, 2007, we had been notified that we are a
    PRP in connection with 75 locations listed on the EPA’s
    National Priorities List , or NPL. Of the 75 sites at which
    claims have been made against us, 16 are sites we own. Each of
    the NPL sites we own were initially developed by others as
    landfill disposal facilities. At each of these facilities, we
    are working in conjunction with the government to characterize
    or remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed
    with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing
    the costs of remediation or are pursuing resolution of an
    allocation formula. We generally expect to receive any amounts
    due from these parties at or near the time that we make the
    remedial expenditures. The other 59 NPL sites, which we do not
    own, are at various procedural stages under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
    as amended, known as CERCLA or Superfund.

The majority of these proceedings involve allegations that
    certain of our subsidiaries (or their predecessors) transported
    hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our
    acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for
    liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to
    or disposing at the sites. Proceedings arising under Superfund
    typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste
    transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or
    recover costs associated with site investigation and
    remediation, which costs could be substantial and could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. At some of the sites at which we have been
    identified as a PRP, our liability is well defined as a
    consequence of a governmental decision and an agreement among
    liable parties as to the share each will pay for implementing
    that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has been selected
    or the liable parties have been unable to agree on an
    appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain. Any of
    these matters potentially could have a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated financial statements.

For more information regarding commitments and contingencies
    with respect to environmental matters, see Note 3.

Litigation

— In December 1999, an individual
    brought an action against WMI, five former officers of
    WM Holdings, and WM Holdings’ former independent
    auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, in Illinois state court on behalf
    of a proposed class of individuals who purchased
    WM Holdings common stock before November 3, 1994, and
    who held that stock through February 24, 1998. The action
    is for alleged acts of common law fraud, negligence and breach
    of fiduciary duty. This case has been dormant for some time, and
    based on U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the Company believes
    this case will not proceed as a class action, thereby ending the
    litigation.

In April 2002, a former participant in WM Holdings’
    ERISA plans and another individual filed a lawsuit in
    Washington, D.C. against WMI, WM Holdings and others,
    attempting to increase the recovery of a class of ERISA plan
    participants based on allegations related to both the events
    alleged in, and the settlements relating to, the securities
    class action against WM Holdings that was settled in 1998
    and the securities class action against us that was settled in
    November 2001. Subsequently, the issues related to the latter
    class action have been dropped as to WMI, its officers and
    directors. The case is ongoing with respect to WM Holdings
    and others, and WM Holdings intends to defend itself
    vigorously.

There are two separate wage and hour lawsuits pending against us
    in California, each seeking class certification. Both actions
    make the same general allegations that the defendants failed to
    comply with certain



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

California wage and hour laws, including allegedly failing to
    provide meal and rest periods, and failing to properly pay
    hourly and overtime wages. We deny the plaintiffs’ claims
    and intend to vigorously defend these matters. As the litigation
    is in the early stages of the legal process, and given the
    inherent uncertainties of litigation, the ultimate outcome
    cannot be predicted at this time, nor can the amount of any
    potential loss be reasonably estimated.

From time to time, we pay fines or penalties in environmental
    proceedings relating primarily to waste treatment, storage or
    disposal facilities. As of December 31, 2007, there were
    four proceedings involving our subsidiaries where we reasonably
    believe that the sanctions could equal or exceed $100,000. The
    matters involve allegations that subsidiaries (i) failed to
    comply with leachate storage requirements at an operating
    landfill; (ii) violated federal air regulations at an
    operating landfill; (iii) failed to meet reporting
    requirements under federal air regulations at an operating
    landfill; and (iv) violated National Pollutant Discharge
    Elimination System permit conditions at an operating landfill.
    We do not believe that the fines or other penalties in any of
    these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

From time to time, we also are named as defendants in personal
    injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class
    actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported
    waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have
    contaminated the environment or, in certain cases, on the basis
    of having conducted environmental remediation activities at
    sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of
    monitoring of allegedly affected sites and health care
    examinations of allegedly affected persons for a substantial
    period of time even where no actual damage is proven. While we
    believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, the
    ultimate resolution is often substantially uncertain due to the
    difficulty of determining the cause, extent and impact of
    alleged contamination (which may have occurred over a long
    period of time), the potential for successive groups of
    complainants to emerge, the diversity of the individual
    plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential contribution
    or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or other third
    parties, among other factors. Accordingly, it is possible such
    matters could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

As a large company with operations across the United States and
    Canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits,
    disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our
    business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal
    issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against
    us include commercial, customer, and employment related claims,
    including purported class action lawsuits related to our
    customer service agreements and purported class actions
    involving federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The
    plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or
    injunctive relief, or both. These actions are in various
    procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We
    currently do not believe that any such actions will ultimately
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

WMI’s charter and bylaws currently require indemnification
    of its officers and directors if statutory standards of conduct
    have been met and allow the advancement of expenses to these
    individuals upon receipt of an undertaking by the individuals to
    repay all expenses if it is ultimately determined that they did
    not meet the required standards of conduct. Additionally, WMI
    has entered into separate indemnification agreements with each
    of the members of its Board of Directors as well as its Chief
    Executive Officer, its President and its Chief Financial
    Officer. The charter and bylaw documents of certain of
    WMI’s subsidiaries, including WM Holdings, also
    include similar indemnification provisions, and some
    subsidiaries, including WM Holdings, entered into separate
    indemnification agreements with their officers and directors
    prior to our acquisition of them that provide for even greater
    rights and protections for the individuals than WMI’s
    charter and bylaws. A company’s obligations to indemnify
    and advance expenses are determined based on the governing
    documents in effect and the status of the individual at the time
    the actions giving rise to the claim occurred. As a result, we
    may have obligations to individuals after they leave the
    Company, to individuals that were associated with companies
    prior to our acquisition of them and to individuals that are or
    were employees of the Company, but who were neither an officer
    or a director, even though the current documents only require
    indemnification and advancement to officers and directors. The
    Company may incur substantial expenses in connection with the
    fulfillment of its advancement of costs and indemnification



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

obligations in connection with current actions involving former
    officers of the Company or its subsidiaries or other actions or
    proceedings that may be brought against its former or current
    officers, directors and employees.

Tax matters

— We are currently under audit by
    the IRS and from time to time are audited by other taxing
    authorities. We fully cooperate with all audits, but defend our
    positions vigorously. Our audits are in various stages of
    completion. We have concluded several audits in the last two
    years. During the second quarter of 2006, we concluded the IRS
    audit for the years 2002 and 2003. In the first quarter of 2007,
    we concluded the IRS audit for the years 2004 and 2005. The
    current period financial statement impact of concluding various
    audits is discussed in Note 8. In addition, we are
    currently in the examination phase of an IRS audit for the years
    2006 and 2007. We expect this audit to be completed within the
    next 12 months. Audits associated with state and local
    jurisdictions date back to 1999 and examinations associated with
    Canada date back to 2002. To provide for certain potential tax
    exposures, we maintain a liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, the balance of which management believes is adequate.
    For additional information related to our liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits refer to Note 8. Results of audit
    assessments by taxing authorities could have a material effect
    on our quarterly or annual cash flows as audits are completed,
    although we do not believe that current tax audit matters will
    have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

As discussed in Note 7, we have approximately
    $2.8 billion of tax-exempt financings as of
    December 31, 2007. Tax-exempt financings are structured
    pursuant to certain terms and conditions of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which exempts
    from taxation the interest income earned by the bondholders in
    the transactions. The requirements of the Code can be complex,
    and failure to comply with these requirements could cause
    certain past interest payments made on the bonds to be taxable
    and could cause either outstanding principal amounts on the
    bonds to be accelerated or future interest payments on the bonds
    to be taxable. Some of the Company’s tax-exempt financings
    have been, or currently are, the subject of examinations by the
    IRS to determine whether the financings meet the requirements of
    the Code and applicable regulations. It is possible that an
    adverse determination by the IRS could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s cash flows and results of
    operations.

Unclaimed property audits

— State escheat laws
    generally require entities to report and remit abandoned and
    unclaimed property including unclaimed wages, vendor payments
    and customer refunds. Failure to timely report and remit the
    property can result in assessments that include substantial
    interest and penalties, in addition to the payment of the
    escheat liability itself. During 2007, all ongoing unclaimed
    property audits have been concluded, and we have satisfied all
    resulting financial obligations. As a result of the conclusion
    of these audits, we recognized a $5 million charge,
    including $2 million of “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses and $3 million of
    “Interest expense,” in 2007. During 2006, we submitted
    unclaimed property filings with all of the states except those
    where we were under audit, and, as a result of our findings, we
    determined that we had estimated unrecorded obligations
    associated with unclaimed property for escheatable items for
    various periods between 1980 and 2004. Our “Selling,
    general and administrative” expenses for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 included a charge of approximately
    $20 million to fully record our estimated obligations for
    unclaimed property. During 2006, we also recognized
    $1 million of estimated interest obligations associated
    with our findings, which has been included in “Interest
    expense” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We
    have determined that the impact of these adjustments is not
    material to current or prior periods’ results of
    operations. Although we cannot currently estimate the potential
    financial impacts that our previous voluntary compliance filings
    may have, we do not expect any resulting obligations to have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations or cash flows.

11.

Restructuring

2007 Restructuring and Realignment

— In the
    first quarter of 2007, we restructured certain operations and
    functions, resulting in the recognition of a charge of
    approximately $9 million. We incurred an additional
    $1 million of costs for this restructuring during the
    second quarter of 2007, increasing the costs incurred to date to
    $10 million. Approximately $7 million of our
    restructuring costs was incurred by our Corporate organization,
    $2 million was



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

incurred by our Midwest Group and $1 million was incurred
    by our Western Group. These charges included approximately
    $8 million for employee severance and benefit costs and
    approximately $2 million related to operating lease
    agreements.

Through December 31, 2007, we had paid approximately
    $6 million of the employee severance and benefit costs
    incurred as a result of this restructuring. The length of time
    we are obligated to make severance payments varies, with the
    longest obligation continuing through the first quarter of 2009.

2005 Restructuring and Workforce Reduction

—
    During the third quarter of 2005, we reorganized and simplified
    our management structure by reducing our Group and corporate
    office staffing levels. This reorganization increased the
    accountability and responsibility of our Market Areas and
    allowed us to streamline business decisions and to reduce costs
    at the Group and Corporate offices. Additionally, as part of our
    restructuring, the responsibility for the management of our
    Canadian operations was assumed by our Eastern, Midwest and
    Western Groups, thus eliminating the Canadian Group. See
    discussion at Note 20.

The reorganization eliminated about 600 employee positions
    throughout the Company. In 2005, we recorded $28 million
    for costs associated with the implementation of the new
    structure. These charges included $25 million for employee
    severance and benefit costs, $1 million related to
    abandoned operating lease agreements and $2 million related
    to consulting fees incurred to align our sales strategy to our
    changes in both resources and leadership that resulted from the
    reorganization.

Through December 31, 2007, all employee severance and
    benefit costs incurred as a result of this restructuring have
    been paid. Approximately $1 million, $6 million and
    $18 million of these payments were made during 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The length of time we were obligated to
    make severance payments varied, with the longest obligation
    ending in the third quarter of 2007.

(Income) expense from divestitures (including held-for-sale
    impairments)

— The net gains from divestitures in
    all three years were a result of our fix-or-seek exit
    initiative, and 2005 also included a $39 million gain from
    the divestiture of a landfill in Canada as a result of a
    Divestiture Order by the Competition Bureau. Gains recognized
    from divestitures in 2006 were partially offset by the
    recognition of aggregate impairment charges of $18 million
    for operations held for sale as required by
    SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.

Impairments of assets held-for-use

— During
    2007, we recognized $12 million in impairment charges due
    to impairments recognized for two landfills in our Southern
    Group. The impairments were necessary as a result of the
    re-evaluation of our business alternatives for one landfill and
    the expiration of a contract that we had expected would be
    renewed that had significantly contributed to the volumes for
    the second landfill.

The $24 million of impairment charges recognized during
    2006 was primarily related to the impairment of a landfill in
    our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations
    for future expansions and the impairment of under-performing
    operations in our WMRA Group.

During the second quarter of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a
    $35 million charge for the impairment of the Pottstown
    Landfill in Pennsylvania. We determined that the impairment was
    necessary after the denial of a permit application for a
    vertical expansion at the landfill was upheld and we decided not
    to pursue an appeal of that decision. In addition, during 2005
    we recorded $68 million in impairment charges associated
    with capitalized software, driven by a $59 million charge
    for revenue management system software that had previously been
    under development. The remaining impairment charges recognized
    in 2005 were largely related to the impairment of a landfill in
    our Eastern Group as a result of a change in our expectations
    for future expansions.

Other

— In both 2006 and 2005 we recognized
    charges associated with the termination of legal matters related
    to issues that arose in 2000 and earlier. In 2006, we recognized
    a $26 million charge for the impact of an arbitration
    ruling against us related to the termination of a joint venture
    relationship in 2000. In 2005, we recognized a $16 million
    charge for the impact of a settlement reached with a group of
    stockholders that had opted not to participate in the settlement
    of the securities class action lawsuit against us related to
    1998 and 1999 activity and a $27 million charge to settle
    our ongoing defense costs associated with possible indemnity
    obligations to former officers of WM Holdings related to
    the litigation brought against them by the SEC. The 2005 charges
    were partially offset by the recognition of a net benefit of
    $12 million, primarily for adjustments to receivables and
    estimated obligations for non-solid waste operations that had
    been sold in 1999 and 2000.

Capital
    Stock, Share Repurchases and Dividends

Capital
    stock

As of December 31, 2007, we have 500.1 million shares
    of common stock issued and outstanding. We have 1.5 billion
    shares of authorized common stock with a par value of $0.01 per
    common share. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue
    preferred stock in series, and with respect to each series, to
    fix its designation, relative rights (including voting,
    dividend, conversion, sinking fund, and redemption rights),
    preferences (including dividends and liquidation) and
    limitations. We have ten million shares of authorized preferred
    stock, $0.01 par value, none of which is currently
    outstanding.

Share
    repurchases

In 2004, our Board of Directors approved a capital allocation
    plan that allowed for up to $1.2 billion in annual share
    repurchases, and dividend payments, for each of 2005, 2006 and
    2007. In June 2006, our Board of Directors approved up to
    $350 million of additional share repurchases for 2006,
    increasing the maximum amount of capital to be allocated to our
    share repurchases and dividend payments for 2006 to
    $1.55 billion. In March 2007, our Board of Directors
    approved up to $600 million of additional share repurchases
    for 2007 and in November 2007 our Board of Directors approved up
    to $300 million of additional share repurchases, which is
    not limited to any calendar year. As a result, the maximum
    amount of capital to be allocated to our share repurchases and
    dividend payments in 2007 was $2.1 billion. All share
    repurchases in 2005, 2006 and 2007 have been made pursuant to
    these Board authorized capital allocation plans.

In December 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new capital
    allocation program that includes the authorization for up to
    $1.4 billion in combined cash dividends and common stock
    repurchases in 2008. Approximately $184 million of the
    November 2007 additional authorization of $300 million
    remained available for repurchases at year-end. As a result, the
    maximum amount of capital to be allocated to our share
    repurchases and dividend payments in 2008 is approximately
    $1,584 million.

Our 2006 share repurchase activity includes
    $291 million paid to repurchase our common stock through an
    accelerated share repurchase transaction. The number of shares
    we repurchased under the accelerated repurchase transaction was
    determined by dividing $275 million by the fair market
    value of our common stock on the repurchase date. At the end of
    the valuation period, which was in February 2006, we were
    required to make a settlement payment for the difference between
    the $275 million paid at the inception of the valuation
    period and the weighted average daily market price of our common
    stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we
    repurchased, or $16 million. We elected to make the
    required settlement payment in cash.

In November 2007, we entered into a plan under SEC

Rule 10b5-1

to effect market purchases of our common stock in 2008. These
    common stock repurchases were made in accordance with our Board
    approved capital allocation program. We repurchased
    $175 million of our common stock pursuant to the plan,
    which was completed on February 7, 2008.

Future share repurchases will be made within the limits approved
    by our Board of Directors at the discretion of management, and
    will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board
    in making dividend declarations.

In December 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors
    expects to increase the per share quarterly dividend from $0.24
    to $0.27 for dividends declared in 2008. However, all future
    dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net
    earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business
    plans and other factors the Board may deem relevant.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which employees
    that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase
    shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for
    two offering periods for purchases: January through June and
    July through December. At the end of each offering period,
    employees are able to purchase shares of common stock at a price
    equal to 85% of the lesser of the market value of the stock on
    the first or last day of such offering period. The purchases are
    made through payroll deductions, and the number of shares that
    may be purchased is limited by IRS regulations. The total number
    of shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in each
    of 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately 713,000, 644,000, and
    675,000, respectively. Including the impact of the January 2008
    issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2007
    offering period, approximately 1.3 million shares remain
    available for issuance under the plan.

Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is “compensatory”
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly,
    beginning with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on
    January 1, 2006 we recognize compensation expense
    associated with our employees’ participation in the Stock
    Purchase Plan. Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan increased annual
    compensation expense by approximately $5 million, or
    $3 million net of tax for both 2007 and 2006.

Employee
    Stock Incentive Plans

Pursuant to our stock incentive plan, we have the ability to
    issue stock options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights,
    all on terms and conditions determined by the Management
    Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

As of January 1, 2004, we had two plans under which we
    granted stock options and restricted stock awards: the 2000
    Stock Incentive Plan and the 2000 Broad-Based Plan. These two
    plans allowed for grants of stock options, appreciation rights
    and stock awards to key employees, except grants under the 2000
    Broad-Based Plan could not be made to any executive officer. All
    of the options granted under these plans had exercise prices
    equal to the fair

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

market value as of the date of the grant, expired no later than
    ten years from the date of grant and vested ratably over a four
    or five-year period.

Since May 2004, all stock-based compensation awards described
    herein have been made under the Company’s 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan, which authorizes the issuance of a maximum of
    34 million shares of our common stock. Upon adoption by the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board
    of Directors and the approval by the stockholders of the 2004
    Stock Incentive Plan at the 2004 Annual Meeting of stockholders,
    all of the Company’s other stock-based incentive plans were
    terminated, with the exception of the 2000 Broad-Based Employee
    Plan. The Broad-Based Employee Plan was not required to be
    approved by stockholders, as no executive officers of the
    Company may receive any grants under the plan. However, only
    approximately 100,000 shares remain available for issuance
    under that plan. We currently utilize treasury shares to meet
    the needs of our equity-based compensation programs under the
    2004 Stock Incentive Plan and to settle outstanding awards
    granted pursuant to previous incentive plans.

As a result of both the changes in accounting required by
    SFAS No. 123(R) for share-based payments and a desire
    to design our long-term incentive plans in a manner that creates
    a stronger link to operating and market performance, the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee approved a
    substantial change in the form of awards that we grant. As
    discussed above, through December 31, 2004, stock option
    awards were the primary form of equity-based compensation.
    Beginning in 2005, annual stock option grants were eliminated
    and, for key members of our management and operations personnel,
    replaced with grants of restricted stock units and performance
    share units. Stock option grants in connection with new hires
    and promotions were replaced with grants of restricted stock
    units.

Restricted stock units —

During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we granted approximately 324,000
    restricted stock units. Restricted stock units provide award
    recipients with dividend equivalents during the vesting period,
    but the units may not be voted or sold until time-based vesting
    restrictions have lapsed. Restricted stock units granted prior
    to 2007 vest ratably over a four-year period. In 2007, the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee changed the
    terms of the restricted stock units granted to provide for
    three-year cliff vesting. Unvested units are subject to
    forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination.
    Restricted stock units granted in 2007 are subject to pro-rata
    vesting upon an employee’s retirement or involuntary
    termination other than for cause and become immediately vested
    in the event of an employee’s death or disability.

Compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is
    measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock
    and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required
    employment period, which is generally the vesting period.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    current period and historical forfeitures.

The total fair market value of the shares issued upon the
    vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $14 million and
    $7 million, respectively. This amount was not material in
    2005.

Performance share units —

During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we granted approximately 907,000
    performance share units. The performance share units are payable
    in shares of common stock based on the achievement of certain
    financial measures, after the end of a three-year performance
    period. At the end of the three-year period, the number of
    shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the targeted amount.
    Performance share units have no voting rights and performance
    share units granted prior to 2007 received no dividend
    equivalents during the required performance period. Beginning in
    2007, dividend equivalents are paid out in cash based on actual
    performance at the end of the awards’ performance period.
    These performance share units are payable to an employee (or his
    beneficiary) upon death or disability as if that employee had
    remained employed until the end of the performance period,
    subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s retirement
    or involuntary termination other than for cause and subject to
    forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination.

Compensation expense associated with performance share units
    that continue to vest based on future performance is measured
    based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock, net of
    the present value of expected dividend payments on our common
    stock during the vesting period. Compensation expense is
    recognized ratably over the performance period based on our
    estimated achievement of the established performance criteria.
    Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we
    expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of
    both the probability that the performance criteria will be
    achieved and current period and historical forfeitures.

The Company’s performance exceeded the target performance
    level established for the awards that vested in 2007.
    Accordingly, we issued approximately 65,000 shares with a
    fair market value of $2 million upon the vesting of these
    awards.

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we
    recognized $31 million and $21 million, respectively,
    of compensation expense associated with restricted stock unit
    and performance share unit awards as a component of
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our “Provision for
    (benefit from) income taxes” for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 include a related deferred
    income tax benefit of $12 million and $8 million,
    respectively. We have not capitalized any equity-based
    compensation costs during the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that a total
    of approximately $50 million of currently unrecognized
    compensation expense will be recognized in future periods for
    unvested restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards
    issued and outstanding. This expense is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
    1.9 years.

Stock options —

Prior to 2005, stock options
    were the primary form of equity-based compensation we granted to
    our employees. On December 16, 2005, the Management
    Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors
    approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock
    options awarded under our stock incentive plans effective
    December 28, 2005. The decision to accelerate the vesting
    of outstanding stock options was made primarily to reduce the
    future non-cash compensation expense that we would have
    otherwise recorded as a result of our January 1, 2006
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We estimate that the
    acceleration eliminated approximately $55 million of
    cumulative pre-tax compensation charges that would have been
    recognized during 2006, 2007 and 2008 as the stock options would
    have continued to vest. We recognized a $2 million pre-tax
    charge to compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2005
    as a result of the acceleration, but do not expect to recognize
    future compensation expense for the accelerated options under
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Non-Employee
    Director Plans

Pursuant to our 2003 Directors’ Deferred Compensation
    Plan, a portion of the cash compensation that our directors
    would otherwise receive is deferred until after their
    termination from board service and each director may elect to
    defer the remaining cash compensation to a date that he chooses,
    which must be after termination of board service. At that time,
    all deferred compensation is paid in shares of our common stock.
    The number of shares the directors receive is calculated on the
    date the cash compensation would have been payable, based on the
    fair market value of our common stock on that day. Beginning in
    2008, directors receive stock awards in lieu of units. The stock
    awards are granted under our 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and allow
    the directors to be taxed on the value of the award immediately
    upon grant.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

We have determined the estimated fair value amounts of our
    financial instruments using available market information and
    commonly accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable
    judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
    estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not
    necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the
    instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use
    of different assumptions

and/or

estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the
    estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on
    information available as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.
    These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and
    current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from
    the amounts presented.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable,
    financial instruments included in other receivables and certain
    financial instruments included in other assets or other
    liabilities are reflected in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements at historical cost, which is materially
    representative of their fair value principally because of the
    short-term maturities of these instruments.

Long-term investments

— Included as a component
    of “Other assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
    at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 is
    $73 million and $72 million, respectively, for the
    cost basis of restricted investments in equity-based mutual
    funds. Unrealized holding gains and losses on these instruments
    are

recorded as either an increase or decrease to the asset balance
    and deferred as a component of “Accumulated other
    comprehensive income” in the equity section of our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized holding gains on
    these instruments, net of taxes, were $5 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and $10 million as of
    December 31, 2006. Refer to Note 13.

Debt and interest rate derivatives

— At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of our debt
    was approximately $8.3 billion. The carrying value includes
    adjustments for both the unamortized fair value adjustments
    related to terminated hedge arrangements and fair value
    adjustments of debt instruments that are currently hedged. See
    Note 7. For active hedge arrangements, the fair value of
    the derivative is included in other current assets, other
    long-term assets, accrued liabilities or other long-term
    liabilities, as appropriate. The estimated fair value of our
    debt was approximately $8.5 billion at December 31,
    2007 and approximately $8.7 billion at December 31,
    2006. The estimated fair values of our senior notes and
    convertible subordinated notes are based on quoted market
    prices. The carrying value of remarketable debt approximates
    fair value due to the short-term nature of the attached interest
    rates. The fair value of our other debt is estimated using
    discounted cash flow analysis, based on rates we would currently
    pay for similar types of instruments.

Business
    Combinations and Divestitures

Purchase
    Acquisitions

We continue to pursue the acquisition of businesses that are
    accretive to our solid waste operations. We have seen the
    greatest opportunities for realizing superior returns from
    tuck-in acquisitions, which are primarily the purchases of
    collection operations that enhance our existing route structures
    and are strategically located near our existing disposal
    operations. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006,
    and 2005 we completed several acquisitions for a cost, net of
    cash acquired, of $90 million, $32 million, and
    $142 million, respectively.

Divestitures

The aggregate sales price for divestitures of operations was
    $224 million in 2007, $184 million in 2006 and
    $172 million in 2005. The proceeds from these sales were
    comprised substantially of cash. We recognized net gains on
    these divestitures of $59 million in 2007, $26 million
    in 2006 and $79 million in 2005.

Our 2007 divestitures have been made as part of our initiative
    to improve or divest certain under-performing and non-strategic
    operations. As of December 31, 2007, our current
    “Other assets” included $5 million of operations
    and properties held for sale. This balance is primarily
    attributable to our efforts to execute the strategy. As
    discussed in Note 3, held-for-sale assets are recorded at
    the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less the
    estimated cost to sell. Additional information related to our
    divestitures activity is included in Note 12.

19.

Variable
    Interest Entities

We have financial interests in various variable interest
    entities. Following is a description of all interests that we

    we are considered the primary beneficiary of certain of these
    entities. Such entities have been consolidated into our
    financial statements as noted below.

    variable interest entities

Waste-to-Energy LLCs

— On June 30, 2000,
    two limited liability companies were established to purchase
    interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three
    waste-to-energy facilities that we operate under an agreement
    with the owner. John Hancock Life Insurance Company has a 99.5%
    ownership interest in one of the LLCs (“LLC I”), and
    the second LLC (“LLC II”) is 99.75% collectively owned
    by LLC I and the CIT Group. We own the remaining equity interest
    in each LLC. Hancock and CIT made an initial investment of
    $167 million in the LLCs. The LLCs used these proceeds to
    purchase the three waste-to-energy facilities that we operate
    and assumed the seller’s indebtedness related to these
    facilities. Under the LLC agreements, the LLCs shall be
    dissolved upon the

occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a written
    decision of all the members of the LLCs to dissolve,
    (ii) December 31, 2063, (iii) the entry of a
    decree of judicial dissolution under the Delaware Limited
    Liability Company Act, or (iv) the LLCs ceasing to own any
    interest in the waste-to-energy facilities.

Income, losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based
    on their initial capital account balances until Hancock and CIT
    achieve targeted returns; thereafter, the earnings of LLC I will
    be allocated 20% to Hancock and 80% to us and the earnings of
    LLC II will be allocated 20% to Hancock and CIT and 80% to us.
    All capital allocations made through December 31, 2007 have
    been based on initial capital account balances as the target
    returns have not yet been achieved. We are required under
    certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the LLCs
    in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss
    amounts and terminated values under the LLC agreements to the
    extent they are different from the underlying lease agreements.
    We believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of these
    circumstances is remote. Additionally, upon exercising certain
    renewal options under the leases, we will be required to make
    payments to the LLCs for the difference between fair market
    rents and the scheduled renewal rents.

As of December 31, 2007, our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    includes $354 million of net property and equipment
    associated with the LLCs’ waste-to-energy facilities,
    $13 million of debt associated with the financing of the
    facilities and $235 million in minority interest associated
    with Hancock and CIT’s interests in the LLCs.

Trusts for Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation
    Obligations

— We have determined that we are the
    primary beneficiary of trust funds that were created to settle
    certain of our closure, post-closure or environmental
    remediation obligations. As the trust funds are expected to
    continue to meet the statutory requirements for which they were
    established, we do not believe that there is any material
    exposure to loss associated with the trusts. The consolidation
    of these variable interest entities has not materially affected
    our financial position or results of operations.

Significant
    unconsolidated variable interest entities

Investments in Coal-Based Synthetic Fuel Production
    Facilities

— As discussed in Note 8, we own
    an interest in two coal-based synthetic fuel production
    facilities. Along with the other equity investors, we have
    supported the operations of the entities in exchange for a
    pro-rata share of the tax credits generated by the facilities.
    Our obligation to support the facilities’ operations was,
    therefore, limited to the tax benefit we expected to receive. We
    are not the primary beneficiary of either of these entities, and
    we do not believe that we have any material exposure to loss, as
    measured under the provisions of FIN 46(R), as a result of
    our investments. As such, we account for these investments under
    the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the
    facilities. As of December 31, 2007, our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet includes $90 million of assets and
    $31 million of liabilities associated with our interests in
    the facilities.

Segment
    and Related Information

We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our
    Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Wheelabrator and WMRA
    Groups. These six Groups are presented below as our reportable
    segments. Our segments provide integrated waste management
    services consisting of collection, disposal (solid waste and
    hazardous waste landfills), transfer, waste-to-energy facilities
    and independent power production plants that are managed by
    Wheelabrator, recycling services and other services to
    commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers
    throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The
    operations not managed through our six operating Groups are
    presented herein as “Other.”

In the third quarter of 2005, we eliminated our Canadian Group
    as a separate operating and reporting unit, and the management
    of our Canadian operations was allocated among our Eastern,
    Midwest and Western Groups. The historical operating results of
    our Canadian operations was allocated to the Eastern, Midwest
    and Western Groups to provide financial information that
    consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
    operations.



WASTE
    MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Our third quarter 2005 reorganization, as discussed in
    Note 11, also resulted in the centralization of certain
    Group office functions. The administrative costs associated with
    these functions were included in the measurement of income from
    operations for our reportable segments through August 2005, when
    the integration of these functions with our existing centralized
    processes was complete. Beginning in September 2005, these
    administrative costs have been included in income from
    operations of “Corporate and other.” The reallocation
    of these costs has not significantly affected the operating
    results of our reportable segments for the periods presented.

Effective January 1, 2007, we realigned our Eastern,
    Midwest and Western Group organizations to facilitate improved
    business execution. We reassigned responsibility for the
    management of certain Eastern Group market areas representing
    $799 million in assets, including $163 million in
    goodwill, to the Midwest Group; and we reassigned responsibility
    for the management of certain Midwest Group market areas
    representing $435 million in assets, including
    $231 million in goodwill, to the Western Group. In
    addition, in early 2007 we moved certain of our WMRA operations
    to our Western Group to more closely align their recycling
    operations with the related collection, transfer and disposal
    operations. The prior period segment information provided in the
    following table has been reclassified to reflect the impact of
    these realignments to provide financial information that
    consistently reflects our current approach to managing our
    operations.

Quarterly
    Financial Data (Unaudited)

Fluctuations in our operating results between quarters may be
    caused by many factors, including period-to-period changes in
    the relative contribution of revenue by each line of business
    and operating segment and general economic conditions. Our
    revenues and income from operations typically reflect seasonal
    patterns.

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer
    months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and
    demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential
    waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase
    during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues
    and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
    trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
    that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
    the hurricanes experienced during 2004 and 2005, actually
    increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for
    several reasons, including significant

start-up

costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
    Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
    suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
    operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
    of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
    maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
    months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
    scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

23.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements (Unaudited)

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2008. We do not currently expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 to
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
    However, we are continuing to assess the potential effects of
    SFAS No. 157 as additional guidance becomes available.

SFAS No. 159 —
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

—

Including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115

, which permits entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for the
    Company beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has elected
    not to measure eligible items at fair value upon initial
    adoption and does not believe the adoption of this statement
    will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

SFAS No. 141(R) —
    Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

, which establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and
    measures in the financial statements the identifiable assets
    acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling
    interest in the acquiree. This statement also provides guidance
    for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the
    business combination and determines what information to disclose
    to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the
    nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the
    effect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on
    our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions.

SFAS No. 160 —
    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB
    No. 51

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160
    will be effective for the Company beginning January 1,
    2009. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of
    SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Effectiveness
    of Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed
    to ensure that information we are required to disclose in
    reports that we file or submit with the SEC is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified by the SEC. An evaluation was carried out under the
    supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
    of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
    as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
    to ensure that we are able to collect, process and disclose the
    information we are required to disclose in the reports we file
    with the SEC within required time periods.

Internal
    Controls Over Financial Reporting

Management’s report on our internal control over financial
    reporting can be found in Item 8 of this report. The
