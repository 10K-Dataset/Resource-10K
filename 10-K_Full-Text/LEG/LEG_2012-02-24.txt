PART I

PART I

Item 1. Business.

Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a
partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered
components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores and automobiles. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 20 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings;
Commercial Fixturing & Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.

Overview of Our Segments

Residential Furnishings Segment

Our Residential
Furnishings segment began with an 1885 patent of the steel coil bedspring. Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our
customers a single source for many of their component needs.

Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can
produce themselves. In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.



PART I

Bedding Group

•

Innersprings (sets of steel coils, bound together, that form the core of a mattress)

•

Wire forms for mattress foundations

Furniture Group

•

Steel mechanisms and hardware (enabling furniture to recline, tilt, swivel, rock and elevate) for reclining chairs and sleeper sofas

•

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs, sofas and loveseats

•

Steel tubular seat frames

•

Bed frames, ornamental beds, and “top-of-bed” accessories

•

Adjustable beds

Fabric & Carpet Underlay Group

•

Geo components (synthetic fabrics and various other products used in ground stabilization, drainage protection, erosion and weed control, as well as
silt fencing)

Customers

Most of our Residential Furnishings customers are
manufacturers of finished bedding products (mattresses and foundations) or upholstered furniture for residential use. We also sell many products, including ornamental beds, bed frames, adjustable beds, carpet underlay, and top-of-bed accessories,
directly to retailers and distributors. We sell Geo Components products primarily to dealers, contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies.

Industrial Materials Segment

We believe that the
quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing. Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately
500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills. We have five wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. Our Steel Tubing business unit operates two major plants that also
supply nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing. In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we also supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.

On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of
Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western). Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the new Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group. Western specializes in fabricating
thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.

Strategic Direction

Key Financial Metric

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR
= (Change in Stock Price + Dividends Received)/Beginning Stock Price. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion,
dividends, and share repurchases.

We monitor our
TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2011 we generated TSR of 21% per year, on average, which places us in the top 38% of the S&P
500. In addition, our TSR has exceeded that of the S&P 500 index for four consecutive years.



PART I

Our incentive programs reward return generation. Senior executives participate in a
TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit’s direct control.

More Cash to Shareholders

During the past three years, we generated approximately $1.26
billion of cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $75 million in 2011, compared to $68 million in 2010, and $83 million in 2009.

Since late 2007, we have raised quarterly dividends by 56%, from $.18 per share to $.28 per share currently. During the past three years,
we have also repurchased roughly 27 million shares of our stock (and issued approximately 11 million shares through employee benefit plans), which reduced the net outstanding shares by approximately 11%. In 2011, we repurchased
approximately 10 million shares at an average per share price of $22.86 (and issued approximately 3 million shares through employee benefit plans). As discussed in more detail below under “Acquisitions,” we completed the
acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million in January 2012. As such, we do not anticipate repurchasing a significant number of shares in 2012.

Portfolio Management

We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help
guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or
Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as EBIT and EBITDA growth, operating cash flows, and return
on assets. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate
cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum
return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.

Disciplined Growth

Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To attain this goal, we will need to supplement
the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity. First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in
which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.



PART I

Our long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We seek
acquisitions within our growth businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a
sustainable competitive advantage, and a strong fit with the Company; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return, have an internal rate of return in excess of 10% and have positive discounted cash flow; (c) for stand-alone
companies: generally, revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on companies: generally, revenue in excess of $15
million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.

Acquisitions

We had no significant acquisitions in 2009, 2010 or 2011.

In January 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube, which produces thin-walled, larger diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed
products for aerospace applications. Western specializes in fabricating products from specialty materials, such as titanium and other refractory alloys, nickel-based alloys, stainless steel and other high strength metals. Western supplies its
products primarily to the commercial aerospace market, but also to the defense and industrial markets. Western’s products are utilized in aircraft systems and aircraft engine systems, including fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, life
support, stability and cooling systems. Western operates two facilities: one in Kirkland, Washington, and another near San Diego, California. Western had 2011 sales of $57 million and is part of our Industrial Materials segment. The cash purchase
price of $188 million was financed with proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes under our existing commercial paper program, as discussed in Note U on page 122 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information about
acquisitions, see Note R on page 115 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Divestitures

2011 Divestiture

There were no significant divestitures in 2011.

2010 Divestiture

We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment) in the third quarter
of 2010. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit. Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.

2009 Divestiture

We divested the Coated Fabrics business unit (previously in
the Residential Furnishings segment) in the third quarter of 2009. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit. Coated Fabrics is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2009 revenue of approximately $12 million.



PART I

We also divested five other businesses in 2008 as part of our 2007 strategic alignment,
including our former Aluminum Products segment. For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Financial Information

For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, earnings before interest and taxes, and total assets of each of
our segments, refer to Note F on page 91 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Operations

The percentages of our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.

Our international
operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico. The products we make in these countries primarily consist of:

Europe

•

Innersprings for mattresses

•

Wire and wire products

•

Lumbar and seat suspension systems for automotive seating

•

Machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding-related components

•

Retail point-of-purchase displays

•

Automotive control cable systems and seating components

•

Shafts for the appliance industry

Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where
demand for components is growing. Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.

Our international operations face the risks associated with
any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

•

Foreign currency fluctuation

•

Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights

•

Credit risks

•

Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates

•

Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war

•

Nationalization of private enterprises

•

Political instability in certain countries

Our Specialized Products segment, which derives 75% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above
risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.



PART I

Geographic Areas of Operation

We have manufacturing facilities in countries around the
world, as shown below.

For further information
concerning our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 91 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

Sales by Product Line

The following table shows our approximate percentage of
external sales by classes of similar products for the last three years:

Distribution of Products

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products
primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Raw Materials

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

•

Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, coil, sheet, stainless and angle iron

•

Foam scrap

•

Woven and non-woven fabrics

•

Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we
make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:

•

Innersprings and foundations for mattresses

•

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas

•

Automotive seating components

We supply the majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our
U.S. requirements for steel wire. We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.



PART I

Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many
long-term business relationships. In 2011, our largest customer accounted for less than 6% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 22% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers
could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing & Components and Specialized Products
segments.

Patents and Trademarks

The chart below shows the approximate number of patents
issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2011. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.

Research and Development

We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our
other facilities. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of
research and development to be approximately $20 million per year in each of the last three years.

Employees

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 18,300 employees, of which roughly 12,900 were engaged in production. Of the 18,300,
approximately 8,600 were international employees (4,900 in China). Labor unions represented roughly 15% of our employees. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2011. Management is
not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2012. The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.

As of December 31,
2010, we had approximately 19,000 employees.



PART I

Competition

Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line,
but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price
but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.

We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

•

Components for residential furniture and bedding

•

Carpet underlay

•

Adjustable bed bases

•

Components for office furniture

•

Drawn steel wire

•

Automotive seat support and lumbar systems

•

Bedding industry machinery for wire forming, sewing and quilting

•

Thin-walled, titanium, nickel and other specialty tubing for the aerospace industry

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some
of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more
lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw
materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.

Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a
foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market
in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices. We expect these products to continue to grow. Some of our traditional bedding customers are beginning to offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers
comprised of specialty foam and gel. These hybrid products allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring.

In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to
innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam. We saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began. As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding Group improved. The
investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009. The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported
innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of
origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a



PART I

coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or
countervailing duty orders.

Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not
experienced significant seasonality. The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses. Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third
quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.

•

Residential Furnishings:

typically does not exhibit any significant seasonality, except for a reduction in fourth quarter sales.

•

Commercial Fixturing & Components:

generally has modestly stronger third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the fourth
quarter significantly lower. This aligns with the retail industry’s normal construction cycle—the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.

•

Industrial Materials:

minimal variation in sales throughout the year.

•

Specialized Products:

relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in
the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.

Backlog

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our
segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.

Working Capital Items

For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of “Cash from Operations” in Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 46.

Government Contracts

The Company does not have a significant amount of sales derived from Government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any Government.

Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws
and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes



PART I

by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures,
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

Internet Access
to Information

We routinely post information
for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of
charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate
Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section. Information contained on our
website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Discontinued Operations

Some of our prior businesses are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and
cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of
the businesses. The discontinued operations include:

•

Coated Fabrics unit (previously reported in the Residential Furnishings segment).

We divested the Coated Fabrics unit in the third quarter of
2009. It sold non-slip rug underlay and shelf liners primarily to retailers and distributors.

•

Storage Products unit (previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment).

The Storage Products unit was divested in
the third quarter of 2010. It sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and healthcare industries.

For further information on these discontinued operations and 2009 activity primarily related to the Aluminum Products Segment that was
divested in 2008, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below
and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to
time by other reports we file with the SEC.

We have exposure to economic
and other factors that affect market demand for our products.

As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns. Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and
products. Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence. To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing
turnover, energy costs and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts
approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand
weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses. Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by
consumers around the world. Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends. In 2011, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger
ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of
operations.

Deteriorating financial condition of our customers could
negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

We serve customers in a variety of industries, some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand due to a weak global economy. A sustained economic downturn increases the
possibility that one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could adversely impact our sales, net earnings, financial condition, cash flow and liquidity.

Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results.

Raw material cost increases (and our ability
to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs move with the market. When we experience significant
increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Conversely, if raw material costs
decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings.



PART I

Steel is our most significant raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in
nature and have been volatile in recent years. This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year. Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap. We experienced significant
fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.

Higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods. In some cases, higher cost
components were replaced with lower cost components. This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins. This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.

We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet
depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.

Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying
assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.

Competition could adversely affect our operating results.

We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price,
but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well. We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and
finished products from Asia and Europe. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. If we are unable to
purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.

Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a
foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market
in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices. If sales of foam or air core mattresses continue to grow appreciably, it could reduce our market share in the U.S. bedding market, and negatively impact our sales and
earnings.

Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to
potential impairment.

A significant portion
of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately
$1.04 billion, or approximately 36% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled approximately $648 million, or approximately 22% of total assets.



PART I

We review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of
our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or
circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. The annual goodwill
impairment review performed in June 2011 indicated no goodwill impairments, but fair market value for one of our ten reporting units (Fixture & Display) only exceeded book value by approximately 15%. The fair market values of all other
reporting units exceeded book value by more than 30%. The goodwill associated with the Fixture & Display reporting unit was $112 million at December 31, 2011. The unit is dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and
remodeling of existing stores. Retailer activity was moderately lower in 2011, and the unit did not meet expectations. If actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels, future goodwill impairments could be possible.

In December 2011, management approved a restructuring plan
which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming plants. This resulted in long-lived asset impairment of $31 million. Prior to that event, our last material asset impairment occurred in 2007.

If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates
used in the goodwill and long-lived asset calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our results of operations.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk.

We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency
exchange rate fluctuations. In 2011, 29% of our sales were generated by international operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience
currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products
are sold. Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.

Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect
on our operations.

We rely on information
systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities. We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of, and collections from, our customers,
and manage the accounting for, and payment to, our vendors. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may
suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems. If
these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.



PART I

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

The Company’s corporate office is located in Carthage,
Missouri. We currently have 132 manufacturing locations, of which 89 are located across the United States and 43 are located in 17 foreign countries. We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities. However, our manufacturing
plants are our most important properties.

Manufacturing
Locations by Segment

Manufacturing facilities that
we own produced approximately 70% of our sales in 2011. We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs). For additional information
regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 99 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the opinion of management the Company’s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and
distribution of our products. Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base. Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels. With our current
utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate over $4 billion in revenue (assuming current sales mix).

To trim unproductive capacity and reduce overhead costs, management, in December 2011, approved a restructuring plan which included the
closure of four underperforming branches. Of the closed branches, one was in the Residential Furnishings segment, one was in Commercial Fixturing & Components and two were in the Industrial Materials segment.

PART II

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

2011 HIGHLIGHTS

Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011, with
automotive and office furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of
ongoing economic weakness.

Sales growth in 2011
was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings. The main revenue catalyst was raw material-related price inflation, but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade) also contributed to the
year-over-year increase. Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was up slightly. Earnings decreased in 2011, largely due to restructuring-related charges associated with the decision to close manufacturing facilities in certain
businesses facing persistently weak market demand. With concerns about weak markets, we continued to closely monitor working capital levels, and ended the year with working capital as a percent of annualized sales well below our target.

Operating cash for the full year once again exceeded the
amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. In August, we raised the quarterly dividend to $.28 per share and extended to 40 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases at a 14% compound annual growth rate. We also
repurchased 10 million shares of our stock during 2011.

Our financial profile remains strong. We ended 2011 with net debt to net capital below our long-term targeted range and over $500 million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver
facility. The revolving credit agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five-year term ending in 2016.

Late in the year, we announced our plan to purchase Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems. This acquisition aligns
extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets. We completed the acquisition in early 2012.

We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total
Shareholder Return (TSR), on a rolling three-year basis, to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term. For the three years ended December 31, 2011, we generated TSR of 21% per year on
average. That places us in the top 38% of the S&P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.

These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.



PART II

INTRODUCTION

Total Shareholder Return

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR
is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price]. We seek to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term through a balanced
approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.

We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that
ended December 31, 2011, we generated TSR of 21% per year on average, while the S&P 500 index generated average TSR of 14% per year. That places us in the top 38% of the S&P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.

Our incentive programs reward return generation. Senior
executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the
unit’s direct control.

Customers

We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest
customer representing less than 6% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.

Major Factors That Impact Our Business

Many factors impact our business, but those that generally
have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.

Market Demand

Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels,
housing turnover, and interest rates. All these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment,
which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011, with automotive and office furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers
continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness.



PART II

It is our belief that the U.S. economy will face headwinds for longer than we previously
expected. We are no longer willing to wait for an economic recovery to bolster earnings, and as a result, we have taken further steps to improve ongoing profitability. We have closed some production facilities and reduced overhead costs. While these
activities improve our cost structure, capacity utilization levels in the majority of our operations remain low. Our current productive capacity should readily accommodate sales of over $4 billion (assuming current sales mix). Until our spare
capacity is fully utilized, each additional $100 million of sales from

incremental unit volume

is expected to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.

Raw Material Costs

In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials. This
purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have. Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.

We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers;
accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price
increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in
recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.

Steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were
passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. In late 2009 and early 2010, steel costs increased, and we raised our selling prices to recover the majority of the higher costs. By the end of 2010, we were facing further inflation in
steel costs, and we implemented additional price increases in early 2011. By mid-year, market prices for certain types of steel had begun to decrease. The margin pressure we experienced in the last half of 2011 resulted in part from lowering our
selling prices (selectively) in advance of our average cost of steel declining, in order to maintain market share and minimize deterioration in product mix.

As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market
price for steel rod). Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs. As a result, metal margins within the steel industry (and in our rod producing
operation) were lower during 2010. Scrap costs increased further in early 2011 but market prices for steel rod also increased. Metal margins for the full year 2011 were slightly improved.

Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced
changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers. In late 2010 these costs began increasing, and in early 2011, we implemented price increases to recover the majority of
the higher costs.



PART II

When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes
customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We experienced this de-contenting effect in our Residential Furnishings segment in the last half of 2011 (however selective selling price
reductions helped contain this activity). As our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address commodity inflation, our profit margins were negatively impacted. We must continue to find ways to assist our
customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.

Competition

Many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be
smaller, private companies. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and
customer service.

We continue to face pressure
from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from
currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and
large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.

We experienced a temporary loss of market share
during the last half of 2010 as certain of our bedding customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from European suppliers. The opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted from a combination of factors:
i) the weaker Euro; ii) temporarily lower wire costs; and iii) greater excess capacity as a result of economic turmoil in Europe. By the end of 2010, we had regained the majority of the lost volume. The margin pressure we experienced in the
last half of 2011 resulted in part from price competition in other of our businesses as we reduced prices (selectively) to maintain market share in light of depressed industry volume.

Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in
the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their
higher average selling prices. We expect these products to continue to grow. Some of our traditional bedding customers are beginning to offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel. These
hybrid products allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring.

In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam. We saw a distinct decline
in unfair imports during 2008 after



PART II

the antidumping investigations began. As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved. The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009.
The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair
prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with
active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping
and/or countervailing duty orders.

2011 Restructuring Plan

In December 2011, we
approved a restructuring plan to reduce our overhead costs and improve ongoing profitability. The activities primarily entailed the closure of four underperforming facilities. We incurred a $37 million pre-tax (largely non-cash) charge in
the 4

th

quarter of 2011 primarily related to this plan,
which included $31 million of long-lived asset impairments and $6 million of other restructuring-related costs. We expect an additional $2 million of restructuring costs in 2012, with these plant closures complete by mid-year.

Earnings should benefit in 2012 from the cost savings
associated with the 2011 Restructuring Plan and other restructuring activity initiated in the latter part of 2011. Our 2012 forecast anticipates an approximate $15-$20 million pre-tax earnings benefit ($.07-$.10 per share) from these
activities.

Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

We divested seven businesses as a part of the strategic
realignment we announced in late 2007. The bulk of this activity (five of the seven divestitures) was complete by the end of 2008. In 2009, we sold the Coated Fabrics business unit, and in 2010 we divested the Storage Products business unit. Results
of operations for these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements. For more information about discontinued operations and the divestitures, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2011 vs. 2010

Sales growth in 2011 was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings. The main revenue
catalyst was raw material-related price inflation, but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade) also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was up
slightly. Full-year earnings decreased, from $177 million in 2010 to $153 million in 2011 primarily from higher restructuring-related costs.

Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.

Consolidated Results

The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2011, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.

Sales grew 8% in 2011,
largely from inflation and currency rate changes. Unit volumes grew 3% primarily due to a shift in the mix of sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade). Across the bulk of our businesses, in aggregate, market demand increased slightly.

Demand improved in certain of our markets during
2011, with automotive and office furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the
face of ongoing economic weakness.



PART II

Earnings decreased in 2011, largely due to restructuring-related costs associated with
the decision (in the fourth quarter) to close manufacturing facilities in certain businesses facing persistently weak market demand. Other factors, including slightly higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate, and higher selling,
administrative, and other costs essentially offset during the year.

LIFO
Impact

All of our segments use the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are
primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. In both 2011 and 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense ($14 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2010).

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense in 2011 was roughly flat
with 2010.

The 2011 consolidated worldwide
effective income tax rate of 24.2% was lower than the 28.1% incurred in 2010. Several factors contributed to the reduction, including changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions, one-time benefits from tax planning strategies, and
tentative agreement reached with the IRS regarding the examination of our 2004 through 2008 tax years. As a result of the tax planning strategies and audit, we recognized tax benefits of $5 million in 2011. This is comparable to a tax benefit
realized in 2010 related to the IRS examination in that year of certain tax credit claims, which was substantially offset by incremental taxes from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings in that year. We also experienced other less
significant, discrete tax items (both favorable and unfavorable) that substantially offset for the year.



PART II

Segment Results

In the following section we discuss 2011 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for each of our segments. We provide
additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 91.

(1)

This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales
that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.

(2)

Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external
sales.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales increased in
2011, primarily from inflation and currency, which generated little profit. Unit volume in the segment was flat. Demand in most of our residential markets continued to be soft as consumers postponed spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding
and furniture in the face of an ongoing weak economy. Full-year unit volumes were essentially flat in our U.S. Spring business but declined in International Spring and Furniture Hardware (from pronounced market weakness mid-year). The only business
in the segment that posted meaningful unit growth was our Adjustable Bed business, where unit volumes grew 44% for the full year.



PART II

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, primarily due to higher
restructuring-related costs (of $9 million), less favorable sales mix, inflation, and other operating cost increases.

We initiated restructuring activities in the last half of 2011 in an effort to improve ongoing profitability, and part of that activity
occurred in Residential Furnishings. We consolidated four operations in the segment, including two carpet underlay plants, a Canadian spring facility, and a fabric coating business. We expect segment margins to benefit in 2012 from the cost savings
associated with these activities.

Commercial Fixturing &
Components

Sales decreased in 2011, largely
from lower demand in our Store Fixtures business, as some of the large, value-oriented retailers significantly curtailed both new store construction and remodeling activity during the year. In contrast, market demand continued to improve in Office
Furniture Components as that business posted strong growth for the full year. EBIT and EBIT margins also decreased versus the prior year, primarily due to lower sales.

Our efforts to improve ongoing profitability resulted in the
decision late in 2011 to consolidate one of our six remaining store fixture locations. The majority of the sales from this operation will be supplied through two of our remaining facilities. In addition, consistent with our stated plan to
continually assess our portfolio and exit non-core businesses, we divested our small, U.K.-based point-of-purchase display operation in January 2012.

Industrial Materials

2011 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill, both of which generated little
incremental profit. Full-year unit volumes declined in both Wire Drawing and Steel Tubing, reflecting weak bedding, furniture, and store fixtures end markets.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, mainly from higher restructuring-related costs (of $23 million). EBIT margins also decreased
during the year as a result of a change in sales from intra-segment to trade at our steel rod mill. These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs, and have kept the mill running at full capacity while
internal demand for steel rod has been down. However, this sales shift is dilutive to margins since it increases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels.

Restructuring activities in late 2011 involved the closure of
two facilities in the segment. We closed one of our six domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into two of the remaining plants. We also announced the closing of a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire
dishwasher racks into the domestic appliance industry. These activities should improve capacity utilization within the segment in 2012 and benefit future earnings and margins.



PART II

Specialized Products

In Specialized Products, sales increased in 2011, primarily
reflecting improved demand across the major businesses in the segment. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to year-over-year sales growth. Automotive growth continues to be driven by the recovery in global industry production levels.

EBIT increased versus the prior year with the
impact of higher sales partially offset by higher restructuring-related costs (of $7 million), raw material cost inflation, and currency impacts. EBIT margins were flat.

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax,
was not material in either year (2010 or 2011).



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2010 vs. 2009

During 2010, sales increased 10%, reflecting improved market demand in several of our businesses. Full-year
earnings also increased, from $121 million in 2009 to $184 million in 2010.

Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.

Consolidated Results

The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2010, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.

In 2010, sales increased 10%
versus 2009. Demand improved in many of our end markets during the year. The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009. Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong.
Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger-ticket items slowed.

Full-year earnings increased in 2010, primarily reflecting higher unit volumes, a lower effective tax rate, and the non-recurrence of
three significant expense items from 2009



PART II

(detailed in the table above). These earnings improvements were partially offset by lower metal margins. As a producer of steel rod, we are impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference
in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs. As a result, metal margins within the
steel industry (and in our rod producing operation) were lower during 2010.

LIFO Impact

All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made
at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. We experienced a large swing in the LIFO impact in
recent years. In 2009, significant steel cost decreases resulted in a LIFO benefit of $67 million. In 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense of $15 million. The LIFO impact recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each
year by FIFO impacts at the segment level. Segment-level earnings in 2009 were significantly burdened (primarily in the first half of the year) as we consumed higher cost steel while selling prices decreased. In 2010, segment-level earnings
benefitted under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs.

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense in 2010 was roughly flat with 2009.

The consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for 2010
was lower, at 28.1%, versus 39.0% in 2009. In 2010, the tax rate benefitted from the higher level of earnings, changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, and tentative settlements of tax examinations. During 2010, we reached tentative
agreement with the IRS on their examination of certain tax credit claims, and recognized tax benefits of $5 million associated with those claims. These benefits were partially offset by incremental taxes resulting from the repatriation of certain
foreign earnings. During 2010, we repatriated $108 million of foreign earnings, which resulted in a net tax charge of $5 million. In 2009, the higher tax rate reflected unfavorable tax adjustments resulting from Mexican tax law changes, which caused
us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction. As a result, we recorded a $6 million tax charge to earnings related to 2009 and prior year losses that might expire before they could be utilized to reduce taxable
earnings.



PART II

Segment Results

In the following section we discuss 2010 sales and EBIT for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a
reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 91.

(1)

This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales
that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.

(2)

Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external
sales.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales increased in
2010, primarily due to market share gains in our furniture components business. Demand in most of our residential markets was relatively strong during the first half of the year but weakened noticeably in the last half as consumer demand for large
ticket items (such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture) slowed.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus 2009, with the earnings impact from higher unit volumes augmented by pricing discipline, significantly reduced bad debt expense, and a benefit associated with the
sale of a building.



PART II

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Sales increased in 2010 due to relatively strong demand in our Store Fixtures business by value-oriented
retailers, and improved market demand in Office Furniture Components. EBIT and EBIT margins also increased versus the prior year, largely due to higher sales.

Industrial Materials

2010 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and improved market demand. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2009, as
higher sales were more than offset by lower metal margins within the steel industry.

Specialized Products

Sales increased in 2010, reflecting improved demand across all the major businesses in the segment. EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales bolstered by cost
reductions.

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax,
increased $5 million, from a loss of $6 million in 2009 to a loss of $1 million in 2010. This earnings increase was primarily due to the non-recurrence of $3 million (net of tax) of environmental charges related to an aluminum property and lower
long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges associated with the divestitures (which were complete by late 2010).



PART II

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION

In this section, we provide details, reflecting both
continuing and discontinued operations, about our:

•

Uses of cash

•

Cash from operations

•

Working capital trends

•

Debt position and total capitalization

We use cash for the following:

•

Finance capital requirements (e.g. productivity, growth and acquisitions)

•

Pay dividends

•

Repurchase our stock

Our operations provide most of the cash we require, but debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs. For more than 20 years, our
operations have provided more than sufficient cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments. In 2009, we generated the second highest level of cash from operations in our history, at $565 million, which included a significant
reduction in working capital as sales contracted. With a slight increase in working capital in 2010 (due to sales growth), operating cash was $363 million. In 2011, cash flow from operations decreased to $329 million, but still readily exceeded our
annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends. We expect 2012 cash flow from operations to again exceed $300 million. We ended 2011 with net debt to net capital of 29%, below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of
30%-40%. Page 49 presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years.

Uses of Cash

Finance Capital Requirements

Improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be a key focus. However, cash is available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through
acquisitions).



PART II

Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand
manufacturing capacity. The chart above shows that capital expenditures have been relatively stable in recent years, although well below levels of the previous decade. We expect capital expenditures to approximate $100 million in 2012. In all of our
businesses, we continue to invest in the maintenance of facilities and equipment. However, with excess productive capacity across our operations (from continued low demand levels), we have reduced spending on expansion projects. The anticipated
increase in 2012 relates primarily to specific new automotive programs that we have been awarded, and that should contribute to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2013.

In 2008, we began assigning each Business Unit a specific
role (e.g. Grow, Core, Fix, Divest) within our portfolio of businesses. This changed our long-term priorities for allocating capital and reduced capital spending levels. We actively pursue disciplined growth within our Grow business units and
earmark expansion capital for these opportunities. Operations designated as Core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements.

Our strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We are seeking acquisitions within our growth
businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). During the past few years, acquisitions were a lower priority as we primarily focused on completing the
divestitures and improving margins and returns of our existing businesses. As a result, no significant acquisitions were completed in 2009, 2010, and 2011. We recently turned our focus onto acquisitions and have begun actively soliciting
opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline.

On December 20, 2011, we announced our plan to purchase, for $188 million, Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems.
With 2011 sales of $57 million, these operations will constitute a new, stand-alone business unit within our Industrial Materials segment. This acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in
growing, profitable, attractive markets—and that make sense to be a part of Leggett & Platt. We completed the acquisition on January 12, 2012.

Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note R
to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 115.



PART II

Pay Dividends

We expect to continue
returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2011 we modestly increased the quarterly dividend, to $.28 per share, and extended to 40 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound
growth rate of 14%. Our targeted dividend payout is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, but actual payout has been higher recently and will likely remain above targeted levels in the near term. Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a
high priority. We anticipate spending approximately $160 million on dividends in 2012. Cash from operations has been, and is expected to continue to be, more than sufficient to readily fund both capital expenditures and dividends.



PART II

Repurchase Stock

During the past three
years, we repurchased a total of 27 million shares of our stock (and issued 11 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans), reducing outstanding shares by 11%. In 2011, we repurchased 10 million shares at an
average per-share price of $22.86. During the year, we issued 3 million shares through employee benefit plans (including shares that were purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation).

For the past few years, we have made few acquisitions;
instead, we used excess cash (including divestiture proceeds) largely to repurchase shares. With the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube, the amount of stock repurchased during 2012 will likely be significantly lower. Although no specific
repurchase schedule has been established, we have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2012.



PART II

Cash from Operations

Cash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings
and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations. As shown in the chart below (and discussed in the paragraph that follows), most of the variability in cash from
operations in recent years has come from changes in working capital.

In 2011, cash from
operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings. The decrease in 2010 operating cash (versus 2009) was due to the change in working capital levels (as shown in the chart above). Cash from operations in 2009 benefitted from a $186 million
reduction in working capital that occurred as a result of the economy-induced sales contraction.

The following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years.

(1)

The accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net
accounts receivable ÷ (net sales ÷ number of days in the year).

(2)

The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory
÷ (cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the year).

(3)

The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending
accounts payable ÷ (cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the year).



PART II

•

Accounts Receivable and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): The dollar amount of accounts receivable increased from year-end 2010 levels, primarily due to
inflation-driven sales increases. We continue to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts are paid on time. As part of our accounts receivable review process, we evaluate individual customers’ payment histories, financial health,
industry prospects, and current macroeconomic events in determining if outstanding amounts are collectible. In 2011, we incurred $9 million of bad debt expense as compared to $7 million in 2010.

Changes in the DSO reflected in the table above are
consistent with our historical range, and are not indicative of changes in payment trends or credit worthiness of customers. Instead, DSO fluctuates from year to year with normal differences in the timing of sales and cash receipts.

•

Inventory and Days Inventory on Hand (DIO): Although the unit volume of our inventories was down from year-end 2010 levels, the dollar value of
inventories increased slightly due to inflation in raw material costs. During 2011, we recognized expense of $10 million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories; in 2010 this expense totaled $13 million. We do not expect significant
changes in customer or industry trends that would materially increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence.

Our DIO typically fluctuates within a reasonably narrow range as a result of differences in the timing of sales, production levels, and
inventory purchases. Our DIO decreased compared to the prior year due to lower unit volumes of inventory. This improvement reflects a continued focus on optimizing returns and a reduction of inventory in response to persistent demand weakness in
certain markets.

•

Accounts Payable and Days Payable Outstanding (DPO): The dollar value of accounts payable increased in 2011 primarily due to inflation in raw material
costs.

We actively strive to
optimize payment terms with our vendors, and over the last few years, have increased our DPO by approximately ten days. Changes in the DPO reflected in the table above are the result of normal fluctuation in our operating activity.

Working capital levels vary by segment. The Commercial
Fixturing & Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the Fixture & Display group. This business group also generally
requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.



PART II

Capitalization

This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.

(1)

These calculations include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the
averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.

(2)

Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in
operating leases. Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.

The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2011 and 2010, calculated in two ways:

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.



PART II

We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more
meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.

Total debt (which includes
long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $72 million in 2011. During the year, we increased our commercial paper borrowings by $70 million.

In anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in 2010. The swap contracts
manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 million of potential future debt issuance, and mature in August 2012. The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0%. They do not hedge the credit spread over treasuries, our credit
worthiness, or the market price of credit related to any future debt issuances. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 117.

Short Term Borrowings

We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600
million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 13 lenders. This agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five-year term ending in 2016. The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250 million. When we issue letters of
credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:



PART II

The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2011 was $118
million and $195 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $131 million and $174 million respectively. Commercial paper amounts fluctuated during the year due to normal changes in working
capital funding requirements. At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $74 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.

On January 10, 2012, we increased the amount of
commercial paper outstanding to $341 million. These proceeds were used primarily to finance the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube (cash purchase price of $188 million), but also for ordinary working capital needs and other general purposes.

With anticipated operating cash flows, our
commercial paper program, and our expected ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, repurchase stock, and repay maturing debt.

Accessibility of Cash

At December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $236 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

A substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations. Though we do not rely on this
foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost. However, if we had to bring all the
foreign cash back immediately, we could incur incremental taxes of up to $53 million.

In 2010, we brought back $121 million of foreign cash at an incremental tax cost of $5 million. In 2011, we brought back an additional $89 million through payments on intercompany loans at no added
tax cost.



PART II

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes our future contractual cash
obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011:

¹

The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.

²

Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.

³

Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 at rates in effect at the end of the year.



PART II

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would
change, and some of those changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual
events, as they occur.

“Critical accounting
estimates” are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial
statements.

We provide additional details
regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.

CONTINGENCIES

Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the likelihood
that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost. Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.

NPI Lawsuit

On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc.
(“NPI”) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC (“Gamber”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video contained
false and misleading statements. NPI and Gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems. NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its alleged
lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber’s profits in an unspecified amount.

Although part of the claims were dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 million in
disgorgement damages against Gamber. On August 16, 2010, the Court: (a) reduced the jury verdict to approximately $0.5 million; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction
requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict. The Court subsequently awarded NPI $2.0 million in attorney fees and costs.

On September 17, 2010, NPI filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Gamber also filed an appeal. On September 7,
2011, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision. Each party filed a request for rehearing en banc (a rehearing by the full court), which was denied on October 24, 2011. On November 22, 2011, our
insurance carrier paid the judgment and attorney fee awards in full (roughly $2.5 million). Therefore, this matter is resolved.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper
County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284 (“2010 Suit”). The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 (“2009 Suit”). The 2009 Suit was
dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff’s failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders. As before, the plaintiff did not make such demand. On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice. On May 12,
2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals. The briefing process began January 2012. We do not expect a ruling from the Court of Appeals for several months.

The 2010 Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and
former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E.
Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.



PART II

The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached
their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public
information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.

The plaintiff was seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other
relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants’ stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission
of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs. The plaintiff was not seeking monetary relief from us. We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.

We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the
2010 Suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the Court’s ruling in the 2009 Suit, this failure to make demand should not be
excused; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the 2010 Suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common
law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant. As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised
the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing
mechanism well before the grant date.

We do not
expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Antitrust Lawsuits

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants
alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.

A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed
without prejudice. Of the U.S. cases remaining, we have been named as a defendant in (a) three direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) and a consolidated amended class action complaint filed on
February 28, 2011 on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products; (b) an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 (although the underlying lawsuits do not name us as
a defendant); and an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011; and (c) eleven individual direct purchaser cases, one filed March 22, 2011, another amended August 24, 2011 to remove class allegations, one amended
August 25, 2011 to name us as a defendant, four others filed October 31, 2011, one filed November 4, 2011 and three filed



PART II

December 6, 19 and 30, respectively. All of the pending U.S. cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation

, Case No. 1:10-MD-02196.

In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified
damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive
relief against future violations. On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim. On
July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss. Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.

We have been named in two Canadian class action cases (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products), as amended on
November 2, 2011, both under the name

Hi Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.

in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 and CV-11-17279. In each of
the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 15 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100 million, punitive damages of
$10 million, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the action. We have not yet filed our defenses in the Canadian actions.

We deny all of the allegations in these actions and will vigorously defend ourselves. This contingency is subject to many
uncertainties. Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.

Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters

On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Leggett & Platt do Brasil Ltda. (“L&P Brazil”) in the amount of approximately $4 million, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43. The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November
2006 and continuing through December 2007, L&P Brazil used an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innersprings in Brazil. The Brazilian Revenue Office has communicated that
it will likely expand the audit to the tax years 2008 through January 2011. As a result, it is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation on the same subject matter. L&P Brazil responded to the notice of violation
on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.

L&P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16,
2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L&P Brazil seeking approximately $3.3 million for the tax years 2006 and 2007. The State of Sao Paulo argued that L&P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the
collection and payment of value-added tax on mattress innerspring sales in the State of Sao Paulo. On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L&P Brazil nullifying the tax
assessment. The State filed an appeal, which is currently pending.



PART II

We deny all of the allegations in these actions. We believe that we have valid bases
upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves. However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties. At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Patent Infringement Claim

On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict
against us in the amount of $5 million based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs. This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as
case number CV10-07416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive. Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons
Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.

At trial, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 million. We disputed each patent’s validity; the methodology used to calculate
damages; and denied that we infringed any patent. The plaintiff has also requested pre-judgment interest and royalties for future use of the machines and attorneys fees and costs. We intend to object to all of these claims.

We intend to appeal the case to the Federal Circuit Court of
Appeals and believe we have valid bases upon which to appeal. We do not believe that it is probable that the judgment will be upheld on appeal in its current form. We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543
filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011) challenging the validity of each patent at issue. The Patent Office ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of two of the three patents. Imaginal may appeal
those rulings. With respect to the third patent, we intend to appeal the Patent Office’s decision upholding validity; however, due to a change made to all of the machines we do not believe that the machines are currently using the feature
alleged to have infringed the third patent. At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

We adopted new accounting guidance in 2011 as discussed in
Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe this new guidance will
have a material impact on our future financial statements.



PART II

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

(Unaudited)

(Dollar amounts in millions)

Interest Rates

The table below provides information about the Company’s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. Substantially all
of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its carrying value by $29.2 at December 31, 2011, and greater than its carrying value by $6.0 at December 31,
2010. The increase in the fair market value of the Company’s debt is primarily due to the decrease in credit spreads over risk-free rates as compared to the prior year end. The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg
secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2011 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated “spread” over such Treasury securities representing the Company’s interest costs under its medium-term note program. The fair
value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.

*

Includes $70.4 and $0 of commercial paper in 2011 and 2010, respectively, supported by a $600 revolving credit agreement which terminates in 2016.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is subject to market and financial risks related
to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks. The Company seeks to use derivative contracts
that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is the Company’s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments. Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair
value hedges is provided in Note S on page

117 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.



PART II

Investment in Foreign Subsidiaries

The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a
long-term commitment, and does not hedge translation exposures. The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes. The Company’s net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to
translation exposure) in foreign subsidiaries at December 31 is as follows:

(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2011, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

PART III

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.

The subsections entitled “Proposal 1—Election of Directors,” “Corporate
Governance,” “Board and Committee Composition and Meetings,” “Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity,” “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance” and “Director Independence” in
the Company’s definitive Proxy Statement for the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 10, 2012, are incorporated by reference.

Directors of the Company

Directors are elected annually at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders and hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. All current directors have been nominated for re-election at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held
May 10, 2012. If a nominee fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in the director election, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee (N&CG Committee) will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to
accept or reject the director’s resignation and whether any other action should be taken. If a director’s resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company’s next annual meeting and his or her
successor is duly elected and qualified. If the Board accepts the director’s resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy. The Company’s
Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines set the director retirement age at 72; however, the Board Chair, CEO or President may request a waiver for any director. At the request of Leggett’s CEO, the N&CG Committee recommended, and the
full Board granted, retirement age waivers for Directors Enloe, Fisher and Purnell so they may stand for re-election at the 2012 annual meeting.

Brief biographies of the Company’s Board of Directors are provided below. Our employment agreements with Mr. Haffner and

PART IV

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Leggett & Platt,
Incorporated is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
Leggett & Platt;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of Leggett & Platt are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Leggett & Platt; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett & Platt
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of
management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.

Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2011, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report appearing on page 72 of this Form 10-K.



PART IV

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are



PART IV

being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009

A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“we” or “our”). Prior to 2010, many subsidiaries outside of the United States were consolidated
as of and for a fiscal year ended November 30. As of December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries converted to a calendar reporting year. The net impact of the change in fiscal years of these subsidiaries was immaterial, and is presented as an
adjustment to January 1, 2010 retained earnings. Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located
outside the United States. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. Legal costs are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If a range of outcomes are
possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs. Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable. Legal fees are accrued when incurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash
in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and
generally do not bear interest. Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a trade note receivable to facilitate our customers’ operating cycles. Nontrade notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial
payment for the sale of a business. Notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.

The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the
amount of probable credit losses. Interest income is not recognized for accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status. Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several
factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience. Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for
nonaccrual status accounts. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.

INVENTORIES: All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and
production overhead at normal production capacity. The cost for approximately 60% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of
steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap. For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs. For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented
approximated expected replacement cost.



Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items
using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value. Reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory on a FIFO basis were as follows:

DIVESTITURES: Significant
accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:

Discontinued Operations

—A business is classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be
eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal
transactions. Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.

If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale,
including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement. Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations. Gains and losses
related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.

Assets Held for Sale

—An asset or business is
classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely
significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control. Upon being classified as held for sale, the
recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed. Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only
after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed. After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer
depreciated or amortized. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.

Assets Held for Use

—If a decision to dispose of
an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use. Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles;
(ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill. In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, in a held for use business, the carrying value is first compared to the
sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed. An impairment charge is recognized if the
carrying value exceeds the fair value.



PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal. The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.

Property is tested for
recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.

GOODWILL: Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as
triggering events may occur. We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year. Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying value. Reporting units are business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.

If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and
involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to the excess.

In evaluating the
recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the business groups. In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for
similar entities using price-to-earnings ratios. Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, internal sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements. Recent performance
of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment. There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will
change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar
to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The
cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight line method over the
vesting period of the award.

SALES RECOGNITION:
We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination. The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on
shipping date and distance to the destination. We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers nor is it our practice to replace goods damaged or lost in transit. Sales allowances,
discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.



SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a
component of “Cost of goods sold.”

RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation
costs related to exit activities. Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities. We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal
activity when the liability is incurred. Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.

INCOME TAXES: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting
for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or
payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as
appropriate. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized. A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.

The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global
tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management’s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of
these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities
proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F. Our operations are
principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Europe, China, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.

We maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and
generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged. Management also monitors the financial condition and status of noncustomer receivables. Noncustomer receivables primarily consist of notes accepted as partial
payment for the divestiture of a business. Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.

We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.

From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge
foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt. To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used. We do not
anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.

The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.

OTHER RISKS: Although we obtain insurance for workers’
compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles. Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported
claims and for claims



incurred but not yet reported. Provisions for losses are recorded based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by
our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities. We seek to use derivative
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge
relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction. The process includes designating derivative instruments as
hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at fair value in “Other current” or “Sundry” assets or “Other current” or “Other long-term” liabilities.

On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for
it as follows:

Cash Flow Hedge—

The
hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value
is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged
item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged
item. Cash flow hedges are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.

Fair Value Hedge—

The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge. For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective
portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as
the hedged item. Fair value hedges are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.

Net Investment Hedge—

The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is designated as a net investment hedge. The
effective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives, based upon spot rates, used as a net investment hedge of a foreign operation is recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any
ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a net investment hedge is recorded as “Other expense (income), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net investment hedges are presented as
investing cash flows when the contracts are settled.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts
using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates. The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in
comprehensive income.



RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years’
consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2011 presentation:

•

In the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Footnote I – Non-current assets held for sale have been consolidated into “Sundry” assets, as all
material divestiture activity is complete.

•

In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows – Activity related to the purchase and sale of short-term investments previously included in the
“Other” line item within Investing Activities is now presented separately. Activities related to the acquisition of noncontrolling interest and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation previously included in the “Other”
line item within Financing Activities are now presented separately.

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE: We adopted guidance issued in June 2011 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that removes the current presentation options for comprehensive income and requires
presentation in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Although the amendment is effective for first quarter 2012 reporting, we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011.
As a result, the presentation for 2010 and 2009 has been retrospectively adjusted. Because the new guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income, its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

The FASB has issued other accounting
guidance effective for current and future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe any of the other new guidance will have a material impact on our current or future financial statements.

B—Discontinued Operations

We had no discontinued operations activity in 2011. The
following divestitures were completed in 2010 and 2009 and were part of a broader strategic change that occurred in 2007.

2010: Storage Products unit—No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.

2009: Coated Fabrics unit—No significant gains or losses
were realized on the sale of this unit.

The table
below details the segments in which these operations were previously reported and includes activity related to these divestitures, as well as a small amount of subsequent activity directly related to divestitures completed prior to 2009:

(1)

Goodwill and other impairment charges were recorded to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as discussed in Note C.



(2)

2009 activity was primarily related to the Aluminum Products segment that was divested in 2008, and represents charges for an environmental issue related to an aluminum
property that was sold prior to the divestiture of this business.

The Aluminum Products segment was sold in 2008 for $300.0 in cash, a $25.0 subordinated promissory note (fair value of $14.1), and shares of preferred stock (no book value, with face value not to exceed
$25.0, dependent upon future performance of the divested business).

In 2009, we learned that this business needed a capital infusion due to deterioration in business conditions and determined that the collectability of the promissory note was not reasonably assured. We
recorded a $10.6 non-cash reduction in the value of the promissory note that is reported in “Other expense (income), net” on the Statements of Operations. On June 30, 2009, we surrendered the promissory note, and in exchange, received
$15.0 face amount (fair value of $3.5) of redeemable preferred stock. The fair value estimate incorporated various inputs related to the aluminum operations including: historical financial information, assumptions about future revenue, earnings, and
cash flows and earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics. Management believes it was in our best interest to accept the preferred stock in exchange for the promissory note due to the higher likelihood of
recovery resulting from the modification to the buyer’s capital structure.

C—Impairment Charges

Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.

Asset impairments associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Other expense (income),
net.” Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.”



Other Long-Lived Assets

As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are tested
for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

In December 2011, management approved the 2011 Restructuring Plan which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming
facilities and resulted in impairment charges of $31.2 ($19.0 for intangibles and $12.2 for fixed assets) during 2011’s fourth quarter. These impairment charges were largely the result of lowered expectations of future cash flows in certain
operations, including those that produce fabricated wire components used in home appliances. We also incurred restructuring charges associated with this plan as discussed in Note D.

Businesses Held for Sale

In November 2007, we determined that we would exit certain of our business activities. As presented in the table above, asset impairment
charges were recorded as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell for the targeted divestitures became more certain. Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers.

Goodwill

Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year or as triggering events may occur. We
perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year as discussed in Note A.

Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with
each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a
reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value. Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit. These
assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.

The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price–to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit. The
price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years. The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium.
Projected earnings are based upon market analysts’ projections. The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value. Management believes this approach is appropriate because it
provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.

The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the
timing and risk of future cash flows. Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. Discounted cash flow
projections are based on 10-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital
expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.

Goodwill Impairment Reviews

The goodwill impairment reviews performed in each year presented indicated no goodwill impairments. Due to the limited nature and scope of
changes to operations expected as a result of the 2011 Restructuring Plan,



we concluded that a formal goodwill impairment review at December 31, 2011 was not necessary. Reporting units’ fair values in relation to their respective carrying values and
significant assumptions used in these reviews are presented in the tables below. If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.

Reporting units’ fair values in relation to their respective carrying values were:

D—Restructuring

We have historically implemented various cost reduction
initiatives to improve our operating cost structures. These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations. Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years
ended December 31 were comprised of:



2011 Restructuring Plan

In December 2011, we adopted the 2011 Restructuring Plan
which included the closure of four underperforming manufacturing facilities.

The following table contains information, by segment, regarding the amount of each major type of restructuring-related cost incurred in connection with the exit activities.

The portion of the total
restructuring charges in the above table that represents cash charges is $1.2.

(1)

Restructuring charges are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Other expense (income), net.”

(2)

Inventory obsolescence is reported in “Cost of goods sold”.

The accrued liability associated with the 2011 Restructuring
Plan consisted of the following:

We also incurred impairment
costs associated with this plan as discussed in Note C. We anticipate that these exit activities will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2012.



Other Initiatives

Apart from the 2011 Restructuring Plan, we have implemented
various cost reduction initiatives over the last three years to improve our operating cost structures. None of these actions have individually resulted in a material charge to earnings. Total costs associated with these other initiatives have had
the following impact on our financial statements:

Restructuring and
restructuring-related charges (income) associated with continuing operations by segment were as follows:

The accrued liability
associated with Other Initiatives consisted of the following:



E—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:

Intangible assets acquired
during the periods presented included in “Other intangibles” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:



The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset
class are as follows:

Estimated amortization
expense for items included in our December 31, 2011 balance sheet in each of the next five years is as follows:

F—Segment Information

We have four operating segments that are generally focused
on broad end-user markets for our diversified products:

•

Residential Furnishings—components for bedding, furniture and other furnishings, as well as related consumer products

•

Commercial Fixturing & Components—retail store fixtures, displays and components for office and institutional furnishings

•

Industrial Materials—drawn steel wire, specialty wire products and welded steel tubing sold to trade customers as well as other Leggett segments

•

Specialized Products—automotive seating components, specialized machinery and equipment, and commercial vehicle interiors

Our reportable segments are the
same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating decision maker. The operating results and financial
information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.

Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow,
Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.

The accounting principles used in the preparation of the
segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory. Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the
consolidated financial statements.



We evaluate performance based on earnings from operations before interest and income taxes
(EBIT). Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment. Certain of our general and
administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales and EBIT. These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or
otherwise included in the segment assets.

A
summary of segment results for the periods presented are shown in the following tables.



Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for
return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance. These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment. Segment assets for all years are reflected at their
estimated average for the year. Acquired companies’ long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.

United States are principally in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico. The geographic information that follows is based on the area of manufacture.



G—Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share were
calculated as follows:



H—Accounts and Other Receivables

Accounts and other receivables at
December 31 consisted of the following:

Notes are evaluated
individually for impairment, and we had no significant impaired notes for the periods presented.

Our investment in notes that were past due more than 90 days was less than $5.0 at December 31, 2011, of which approximately $4.0 had been placed on non-accrual status.

Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is
reflected below:



I—Supplemental Balance Sheet Information

Sundry assets, accrued expenses, other
current liabilities and other long-term liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following:

J—Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt, weighted average interest
rates and due dates at December 31 are as follows:



We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 of commercial paper through a program backed by our
five-year $600 revolving credit agreement dated August 19, 2011 with a syndicate of 13 lenders. Based on the information currently available to us, we believe the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under
the agreement. The Company’s ability to borrow under the 2011 Agreement is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the 2011 Agreement. The amount of letters of credit is limited to $250. The Company currently
has no outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 Agreement.

Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:

*

As discussed in Note U, the January 12, 2012 cash purchase price of $188 for Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC was financed with proceeds from the sale of
commercial paper notes under this program.

The Company may elect the type of borrowing under the 2011 Agreement, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance, as follows:

(1)

ABR Borrowing

. Under an ABR loan, the Company will pay interest at the Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of (a) the prime rate publicly
announced by JPMorgan; (b) the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus


/


of 1%; or (c) the rate appearing on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 for dollar deposits with one month maturity multiplied by a fraction (the numerator being 1, and the denominator being 1 minus the aggregate of
the maximum reserve percentage to which JPMorgan is subject for eurocurrency funding) plus 1%.

(2)

Fixed Rate Borrowing

. Under a Fixed Rate loan, the Company will pay interest at (a) the rate published on a designated reference page of the Reuters Group
service (for the available currency and interest period chosen for the loan by the Company) equal to the rate published for deposits denominated in such currency with a maturity comparable to such interest period, plus (b) a fixed spread percentage
(based upon the S&P and Moody’s ratings of the Company’s senior unsecured debt).

(3)

Dollar Swingline Loans

. Under a Dollar Swingline loan (which is initially made by JPMorgan for short-term administrative convenience on same day notice) the
Company will pay interest at a rate equal to the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus 1.5%.

(4)

Competitive Loans

. Under a Competitive loan, the Company will pay interest at a rate equal to a competitive variable or fixed rate accepted by the Company.

The Company is required to
periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the 2011 Agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period. Any outstanding principal under the 2011 Agreement will
be due upon the maturity date. The Company may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under the 2011 Agreement, in whole or in part, upon three business days’ notice.

L—Stock-Based Compensation

We use various forms of share-based
compensation which are summarized below. One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes. Shares are issued from treasury for our stock plans’ activity.

Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our
Flexible Stock Plan. At December 31, 2011, the following shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:



The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on the results of
operations for each of the years ended December 31:

When the tax deduction for an
exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a “windfall” tax benefit is created. The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as
additional contributed capital. When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax
“shortfall” is created. To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital. Net windfall is presented below:

(1) Stock Option Grants

We grant stock options in the following areas:

•

On a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees

•

In conjunction with our Deferred Compensation Program

Options granted to a broad group of employees on a discretionary basis

We grant stock options annually on a
discretionary basis to a broad group of employees. Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months, 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant. Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal
to Leggett’s closing stock price on the grant date.

Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and will be amortized by the straight-line method over the options’ total vesting period, except for employees who
terminate due to retirement. A “retirement” termination occurs if the employee is age 65, or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination. For retirement terminations, options continue to vest and remain exercisable for 3 years
and 6 months after termination of employment. Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.



Officers receive stock option awards. Other employees participate in option choice programs.

In connection with the January 2010 grant, we
gave most participants the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options. The value of the cash alternative (paid in the first quarter) was equal to approximately one-half of the Black Scholes value of the option
grant the employee would have otherwise received.

In connection with the January 2011 grant, we offered two different option choice programs. One group of employees was offered the same
option/cash choice as in 2010, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone. Another group of employees, generally higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock
options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of four options foregone for every one RSU offered. The stock units vest in one-third increments at 12 months, 24 months and 36 months after the date of grant.

Deferred Compensation Program

We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key
managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:

•

Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned. The number of options
granted equals the deferred compensation times five, divided by the stock’s market price on the date of grant. The option has a 10-year term. It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after
the grant date. Stock is issued when the option is exercised.

•

Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to
the market price of our common stock on the acquisition date and they vest immediately. Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned. Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock. These dividends are
used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount. Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant’s pre-set election. Beginning in 2010, stock units may be settled in cash at the discretion of the
Company. Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.

•

Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.

STOCK OPTIONS SUMMARY

Stock option information for the plans discussed above
(including discontinued operations) for the periods presented is as follows:

*

Primarily outside directors’ options

**

Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program. During 2011, 74,671 options were exercised at
a below market exercise price, and 389,417 of these options remain outstanding at December 31, 2011. In 2005, we amended the Program to provide only “at market” stock options.

Additional information related to stock option activity for
the periods presented is as follows:

The following table
summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.



The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of
grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option. The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with
executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility, measured daily for a time period equal to the option’s expected life, ending on the day of grant. The expected
dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.

(2) Stock-Based Retirement Plans

We have two stock-based retirement plans:
the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees. We make matching contributions to both plans. In addition to the automatic 50%
match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee’s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.

•

Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment
alternatives at market prices. We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions. Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service. Dividends earned
on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant’s election.

•

Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions. Company contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date. Stock units are converted to
common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program. Beginning in 2010, units from the ESUP may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company. The ESUP offered no diversification opportunity for contributions through
March 31, 2011.

Beginning
April 1, 2011, participant contributions were credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we made premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant’s
contribution. A participant’s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant. Participants may change investment
elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units in these accounts. The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are a component of
“Other current assets” and “Sundry” long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Participant’s diversified investment accounts are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company, and are presented as a component of
“Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” in the accompanying balance sheet and will be settled in cash. Both the asset and liabilities associated with this program are presented in Note Q and are adjusted to
fair value at each reporting period. Company matching contributions are in the form of stock units.

Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements. Distributions under both plans are triggered
by an employee’s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.



Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows:

Details regarding stock unit
activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.

(3) Performance Stock Unit Awards

We also grant Performance Stock Unit
(PSU) awards in the first quarter of each year to selected officers and other key managers. These awards contain the following conditions:

•

A service requirement—Awards generally “cliff” vest three years following the grant date; and

•

A market condition—Awards are based on our Total Shareholder Return [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price] as
compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies. The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S&P 500 and S&P Midcap 400 (approximately 320 companies). Participants will
earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3-year performance period.

Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo
simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies and are based upon assumptions similar to those used for stock options. Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three-year
vesting period.

Below is a summary of the number
of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU’s for the periods presented:

percent (100%) in cash. The 35% portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.

(4) Restricted Stock Unit Awards

RSU awards are generally granted as
follows:

•

On a discretionary basis to selected managers

•

To a group of employees, who have a choice between stock options or RSUs

•

To selected executive officers in connection with employment agreements

•

As compensation for outside directors, who have a choice to receive RSUs or restricted stock

The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on
the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period. As discussed above, beginning in 2011 selected employees can elect to receive RSUs in lieu of option awards.

month and generally cannot be sold or transferred for one year.

M—Employee Benefit Plans

The accompanying balance sheets reflect
an asset or liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Our most significant plans are in the U.S. and represent 88% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.

Net Pension (Expense) Income

Components of net pension (expense) income for the years
ended December 31 were as follows:

Assumptions used for U.S. and
international plans were not significantly different.

We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the
nearest 25 basis points). The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments. The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of
high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans’ projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio. The table below presents the discount rate used for the benefit obligation for
our most significant pension plans. The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.

The overall, expected
long-term rate of return is based on each plan’s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan’s investment holdings, as discussed below.

Pension Plan Assets

The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield
curves, credit risk, etc.).

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.



Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:

Plan assets are invested in
diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities. The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:

Our investment policy and
strategies are established with a long-term view in mind. We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment. In determining the
appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered. Approximately 60% of our significant plans (the “frozen” plans) are employing a
Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% bonds and 40% equities. The remaining significant plans (the “active” plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% bonds, as historical equity returns have
tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.

Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to six different investments: four mutual funds and
two separate accounts.

The mutual funds, all
passively managed low-cost index funds, include:

•

Total Stock Market Index: Large, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles; using index sampling.

•

FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world; using index
sampling.

•

Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market; index sampling.

•

Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market; using index sampling.

The separate accounts are invested as follows:

•

Small cap U.S. equities: Portfolio of small capitalization U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2000 Value Index.

•

U.S. equities: Broad portfolio of U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index.



Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

We expect to contribute $7 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012.

Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years
are as follows:

Total expense from continuing operations for defined
contribution plans was as follows:

We have limited participation
in one union sponsored, defined benefit, multiemployer pension plan. This plan is not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Contributions to this plan were less than $.1 for
each of the years presented, and we do not believe there is a material withdrawal liability associated with this plan.

N—Income Taxes

The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:

Income tax expense from
continuing operations is comprised of the following components:



Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income
taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:

In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the
tax rate benefitted from income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In 2011, the tax rate also benefitted from the release of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax audit
settlements.

In 2009, tax law changes in Mexico
caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction. As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6.0 tax charge to earnings related to current and prior year tax losses that may expire before they can be utilized.

We recognized net excess tax benefits of
approximately $6.1, $0.1, and $1.4 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to stock plan activity, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital. These amounts include net windfall tax benefits as discussed in Note L.

We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are
required to do so. In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists. After a statute period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period. In addition, we are no longer eligible to file
claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.

The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, is $34.8, of which $21.4 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending
balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:



We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income
tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.

As of December 31, 2011, three tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the
years 2009 through 2011. In 2011, IRS examinations of the 2004 through 2008 tax returns were completed, and a final audit report was issued. We are now waiting on review and final sign-off by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Refunds aggregating
$15.6 are expected for all years associated with the audit. In addition, in 2011 we adjusted our reserve for uncertain tax positions with respect to the largest issue in connection with this examination, related to worthless stock deductions, which
had a favorable impact on our tax provision of $3.6. Five tax years were undergoing (or subject to) audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2005 through 2009. Examinations are in progress for each of these years and are at various
stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments. Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination as well, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated
financial statements.

We are not aware of any
changes that would materially impact our tax expense for an increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and
liabilities. The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:

The valuation allowance
primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain. Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions,
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.

These loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates
that vary generally over the next 20 years, but no significant amounts expire in any one year.

Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends. The
tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.



Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which
are indefinitely reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2011, which are indefinitely reinvested, are approximately $270.9. If such earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental taxes would be approximately
$53.2 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change. In 2010, we repatriated $108 of foreign earnings, resulting in a net tax charge of $4.7.

Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

O—Other Expense (Income)

The components of other expense (income)
from continuing operations were as follows:

P—Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

The following table sets forth
the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):



Q—Fair Value

We utilize fair value measures for both financial and
non-financial assets and liabilities.

The primary
areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets for potential impairment
as discussed in Notes B and C.

The areas in
which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.

Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Short-term
investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that
consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources. The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued
as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the
marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following tables present assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.



The fair value for fixed rate
debt was greater than its $730 carrying value by $29.2 at December 31, 2011 and greater than its $730 carrying value by $6.0 at December 31, 2010.

R—Acquisitions

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition during
the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years’ acquisitions:



See the table below for acquisitions during the periods presented. We are finalizing all the
information required to complete purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.

The results of operations of
the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition. The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2011 and 2010 acquisitions had
occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash, at a later date and, are recorded as a
liability at the acquisition date. At December 31, 2011, there is no substantial remaining consideration payable.

We also increased our ownership portion to 100% in the following businesses that were previously not wholly owned:



S—Derivative Financial Instruments

Risk Management Strategy & Objectives

We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In
the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments for the periods presented below. The fair values of the
derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.



Cash Flow Hedges

Derivative financial instruments that we use
to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:

•

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges

—The commodity cash flow hedges manage natural gas commodity price risk. All commodity hedges at
December 31, 2011 had maturities of less than two years. We routinely hedge commodity price risk up to 36 months.

•

Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges

—The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
The foreign currency cash flow hedges outstanding at December 31, 2011 had maturity dates within one year. In general, foreign currency cash flow hedges have maturities within two years.

•

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

—In anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest swaps in
2010. The swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 of planned debt issuance in August 2012. The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% and hedge the benchmark rate of an expected issuance of $200 of debt.
The credit spread over the benchmark bonds will continue to fluctuate until the time of issuance.

The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to
income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.

Fair Value Hedges

Our fair value hedges manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries’ inter-company assets and liabilities. Hedges
designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled. These fair value hedges generally have a maturity date within one year.



Hedge Effectiveness

We have deemed all ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for
ineffectiveness. If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated condensed statements of operations.

Derivatives Not Qualifying for Hedge Accounting Treatment

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had
derivative transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded directly to income and expense in the period impacted, and offset the majority of gains and losses on the underlying Euro
inter-company debt.

The following table sets
forth the pre-tax gains (losses) from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented. This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly
to income or expense.

T—Contingencies

We are a defendant in various proceedings involving
employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws. When it is probable, in management’s judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can
reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings. For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings, and the total liabilities recorded
are not material to our financial position.



NPI Lawsuit

On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc. (“NPI”) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC (“Gamber”), our wholly-owned
subsidiary, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements. NPI and Gamber compete in the market for vehicle
computer mounting systems. NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its alleged lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber’s profits in an unspecified
amount.

Although part of the claims were
dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 in disgorgement damages against Gamber. On August 16, 2010, the Court: (a) reduced
the jury verdict to approximately $0.5; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict. The Court subsequently
awarded NPI $2.0 in attorney fees and costs.

On
September 17, 2010, NPI filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Gamber also filed an appeal. On September 7, 2011, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision. Each party filed a
request for rehearing en banc (a rehearing by the full court), which was denied on October 24, 2011. On November 22, 2011, our insurance carrier paid the judgment and attorney fee awards in full (roughly $2.5). Therefore, this matter is
resolved.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

On August 10, 2010, a shareholder
derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284 (“2010 Suit”). The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same
plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 (“2009 Suit”). The 2009 Suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff’s failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders. As before, the plaintiff did not make
such demand. On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice. On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals. The briefing process began January 2012. We do not expect a ruling from the
Court of Appeals for several months.

The 2010
Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M.
Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.

The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received
backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted
corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.

The plaintiff was seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other
relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants’ stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission
of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs. The plaintiff was not seeking monetary relief from us. We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.

We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the
2010 Suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the Court’s ruling in the 2009 Suit, this failure to make demand should not be
excused; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the 2010 Suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock



prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations
has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant. As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which
(i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.

We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Antitrust Lawsuits

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit
and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.

A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Of the U.S. cases remaining, we have been named as a
defendant in (a) three direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) and a consolidated amended class action complaint filed on February 28, 2011 on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane
foam products; (b) an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 (although the underlying lawsuits do not name us as a defendant); and an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011;
and (c) eleven individual direct purchaser cases, one filed March 22, 2011, another amended August 24, 2011 to remove class allegations, one amended August 25, 2011 to name us as a defendant, four others filed October 31,
2011, one filed November 4, 2011 and three filed December 6, 19 and 30, respectively. All of the pending U.S. cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation

, Case No. 1:10-MD-02196.

In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified
damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive
relief against future violations. On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim. On
July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss. Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.

We have been named in two Canadian class action cases (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products), as amended on
November 2, 2011, both under the name

Hi Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.

in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 and CV-11-17279. In each of
the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 15 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100, punitive damages of $10,
pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the action. We have not yet filed our defenses in the Canadian actions.

We deny all of the allegations in these actions and will vigorously defend ourselves. This contingency is subject to many
uncertainties. Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.

Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters

On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Leggett & Platt do Brasil Ltda. (“L&P Brazil”) in the amount of



approximately $4, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43. The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L&P
Brazil used an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innersprings in Brazil. The Brazilian Revenue Office has communicated that it will likely expand the audit to the tax years
2008 through January 2011. As a result, it is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation on the same subject matter. L&P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the
violation.

L&P Brazil is also party to a
proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L&P Brazil seeking approximately $3.3 for the tax years 2006 and
2007. The State of Sao Paulo argued that L&P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on mattress innerspring sales in the State of Sao Paulo. On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax
and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L&P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment. The State filed an appeal, which is currently pending.

We deny all of the allegations in these actions. We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will
vigorously defend ourselves. However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties. At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or
results of operations.

Patent Infringement Claim

On January 24, 2012, in a case in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used
to assemble box springs. This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-07416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through
10, inclusive. Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.

At trial, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2. We disputed each patent’s validity; the methodology used to calculate damages; and
denied that we infringed any patent. The plaintiff has also requested pre-judgment interest and royalties for future use of the machines and attorneys fees and costs. We intend to object to all of these claims.

We intend to appeal the case to the Federal Circuit Court of
Appeals and believe we have valid bases upon which to appeal. We do not believe that it is probable that the judgment will be upheld on appeal in its current form. We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543
filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue. The Patent Office ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of two of the three patents. Imaginal may appeal
those rulings. With respect to the third patent, we intend to appeal the Patent Office’s decision upholding validity; however, due to a change made to all of the machines we do not believe that the machines are currently using the feature
alleged to have infringed the third patent. At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

U—Subsequent Events

On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of
Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (“Western”). Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems. The company specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed
products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs. Western had 2011 sales of $57 and will be part of our Industrial Materials Segment. The cash purchase price of $188 was financed with proceeds
from the sale of commercial paper notes under our existing commercial paper program discussed in Note J.
