PART I

Item 1. Business.

Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a
partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered
components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores and automobiles. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 19 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings;
Commercial Fixturing & Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products. In addition, certain of our former businesses are classified as discontinued operations.

Overview of Our Segments

Residential Furnishings Segment

Our Residential Furnishings
segment began with an 1885 patent of the steel coil bedspring. Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a
single source for many of their component needs.

Long production runs, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many
customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves. In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.



PART I

Strategic Direction

In November 2007 we outlined significant changes to the Company’s strategy. We adopted a new primary
financial metric, Total Shareholder Return,

(TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends Received) / Beginning Stock Price)

, changed the priorities for use of cash, adopted role-based portfolio management and implemented more rigorous strategic
planning. Our goals were to: i) divest or fix low performing businesses, ii) return more cash to investors, iii) improve margins and returns on the businesses we keep, and iv) then begin to carefully and conservatively grow the Company (at 4-5% of
annual revenue).



PART I

We have made significant progress over the past three years. The divestitures were
largely complete by the end of 2008; margins and returns have improved; and we have returned much of our excess cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. Our focus now is two-part: i) continue improving margins, and
ii) begin laying the groundwork for long-term 4-5% growth.

Some of the activities associated with the change in strategy led to asset impairment and restructuring costs during the past three years. For information related to those costs, see Note C on
page 86 and Note D on page 90 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key Financial Metric

TSR is the primary financial metric we use to monitor performance. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, over the long term. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2010
we generated TSR of 16% per year, on average, which places us in the top 8% of the S&P 500.

We employ four key levers to achieve TSR: i) revenue growth, ii) margin expansion, iii) dividends, and iv) share repurchases. In 2008,
dividends and stock buyback largely drove our TSR; during 2009, we benefited significantly from margin improvement; and in 2010, revenue growth (from improved market demand) boosted TSR. We expect that this balanced approach will generate
consistently higher TSR.

Consistent with the
change in our strategy, we modified some of our incentive plans to emphasize the importance of TSR. Beginning in January 2008, we introduced a new performance incentive for senior executives based solely on 3-year TSR relative to a group of 320
peers. We also modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control.

More Cash to Shareholders

The strategic changes have increased available cash. We expect to continue returning much of this cash to shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases.

During the past three
years, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and divestitures. Furthermore, as anticipated, since 2007 we’ve reduced combined annual spending for acquisitions and capital expenditures by over 70% (to $73 million
in 2010).

Since late 2007, we have raised
quarterly dividends by 50%, from $.18 per share to $.27 per share currently. During the past three years, we have also spent over $600 million to repurchase 33 million shares of our stock, which reduced outstanding shares by approximately 13%.
In 2010, we repurchased over 6 million shares at an average per share price of $21.64 (and issued 4 million shares through employee benefit plans) (most of these shares are purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation).



PART I

Portfolio Management

We manage our business units as a portfolio, with different
roles (Grow, Core, Fix, Divest) for each business unit based upon competitive advantages, strategic position, and financial health. We undergo a rigorous strategic planning process, in part to assess each business unit’s portfolio role.
Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth in competitively advantaged positions. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while
using minimal capital. Business units in the Fix category will be given a limited time in which to significantly improve performance. Finally, a few small business units (or portions of business units) are considered non-strategic, and may be
divested as the M&A market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices.

To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of the Company’s cost of capital. Each business unit has opportunity to improve, and may
employ a variety of means to achieve higher returns including trimming expenses, introducing new products, improving productivity, adopting more disciplined pricing, reducing working capital, and consolidating assets. Business units that fail to
consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital will move to the Fix or Divest categories.

During 2009 and 2010 significant effort went into improving margins. EBIT margin for 2009 was 7.5% on $3.06 billion of sales while EBIT
margin for 2010 was 8.6% on sales of $3.36 billion. Gross margin for 2009 and 2010 was 20.6% and 19.5%, respectively.

Disciplined Growth

Consistent with the plan we unveiled in 2007, we are now beginning to devote resources to the next phase of our strategy. We aim to
eventually achieve consistent, long-term, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To achieve this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2%-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of
opportunity. First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in
markets new to us, and in which Leggett would possess a competitive advantage.

Both efforts are receiving significant management attention and priority, and we are making progress in both areas. We have had success this past year with new products introduced in our office
components, automotive, and home furniture components businesses. Though individually those were modest successes, collectively they added to sales and earnings growth in 2010. In addition, we have instituted some of the processes that need to be in
place to identify new market opportunities. Successful development of new growth platforms will take time; we do not anticipate significant contributions from these activities in the near term.



PART I

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Historically, our typical acquisition targets have been
small, private, profitable, entrepreneurial companies that manufacture goods either within our existing product lines or “one step away” from those product lines and complementary to our existing businesses. As part of our change in
strategic direction, we expect fewer and more strategic acquisitions to be completed. All acquisitions should create value by enhancing TSR; they should have clear strategic rationale and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets.

Acquisitions

We have had no significant acquisitions in the last three
years. For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 118 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Divestitures

During the past three years we divested seven businesses (as a part of our strategic realignment), including the entire Aluminum Products
segment, for total after-tax cash proceeds of $433 million. The largest portion of these proceeds ($408 million) related to the divestitures completed in 2008.

2010 Divestiture

We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment) in the third quarter
of 2010. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit. Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.

2009 Divestiture

We divested the Coated Fabrics business unit (previously in
the Residential Furnishings segment) in the third quarter of 2009. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit. Coated Fabrics is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2009 revenue of approximately $12 million.

2008 Divestitures

We divested five significant businesses in 2008 with
annualized sales of approximately $780 million. The largest divestiture (approximately $485 million in annualized revenue) was the Aluminum Products segment which was sold in July 2008. We also sold four other business units in 2008 – Wood
Products and Fibers (previously in the Residential Furnishings segment); Plastics (previously in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment); and the dealer portion of Commercial Vehicle Products (previously in the Specialized Products
segment). All of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations.



PART I

For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on
page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Operations

The percentages of our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the
United States for the previous three years are shown below.

Our international operations
are principally located in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico. The products we make in these countries primarily consist of:

•

Shafts for the appliance industry

Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe demand for components is growing. Also, in instances
where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.

Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

•

Foreign currency fluctuation

•

Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights

•

Credit risks

•

Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates

•

Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war

•

Nationalization of private enterprises

•

Political instability in certain countries

Our Specialized Products segment, which derives 77% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above
risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.



PART I

Geographic Areas of Operation

We have production, warehousing and distribution facilities
in countries around the world. Below is a list of countries where we have facilities associated with continuing operations:

For further information concerning our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States,
refer to Note F on page 94 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

Sales by Product Line

The following table shows our approximate percentage of
external sales from continuing operations by classes of similar products for the last three years:

Distribution of Products

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own sales personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives
and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Raw Materials

The products we manufacture in continuing operations require a variety of raw materials. Among the most
important are:

•

Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, coil, sheet and angle iron

•

Foam scrap

•

Woven and non-woven fabrics

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we
then use to manufacture:

•

Innersprings and foundations for mattresses

•

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas

•

Displays, shelving and racks for retailers

•

Automotive seating components

We supply the majority of our steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S.
requirements for steel wire. We also produce welded steel tubing both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers. In addition, we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials we use.

We have experienced volatility in raw material prices over
the past few years, most notably in steel. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were



PART I

passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. Significant steel cost increases in 2008 were followed by significant cost decreases in 2009 as global economies weakened. In both
cases, we generally adjusted pricing to our customers to reflect the changes in commodity costs. In late 2009 and early 2010, steel costs increased, and again we implemented price increases to recover the majority of the higher costs. By the end of
2010, we were facing further inflation in steel costs, and announced and began implementing additional price increases in early 2011.

The degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs, should they occur, could influence our future earnings. Also, if raw
material costs decrease there may be downward pressure on selling prices, temporarily resulting in lower segment margins, as we consume higher cost inventories.

Higher raw material costs in recent years have led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of
our components in their finished goods. In some cases, higher cost components have been replaced with lower cost components, causing us to shift production accordingly. This has primarily impacted profit margins in our Residential Furnishings and
Industrial Materials segments. We are responding by developing new products (including new types of innersprings, box springs and reclining chair mechanisms) that enable our customers to reduce their total costs, and in certain instances, provide
higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.

Customer
Concentration

We serve thousands of customers
worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2010, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 22% of these
consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings,
Commercial Fixturing & Components and Specialized Products segments.



PART I

Patents and Trademarks

The chart below shows the approximate number of patents
issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our continuing operations.

Some of our most significant

Research and Development

We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our
other facilities. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of
research and development associated with continuing operations ranged from $20 to $30 million per year in each of the last three years.



PART I

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 19,000 employees, of which roughly 13,600 were engaged in production. Of the 19,000,
approximately 8,700 were international employees (5,000 in China). Labor unions represented roughly 11% of our employees. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2010. Management is
not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2011. The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.

As of December 31, 2009,
we had approximately 18,500 employees.

Competition

Many companies offer products that compete with those we
manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and
customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.

We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of
revenue, of the following:

•

Components for residential furniture and bedding

•

Carpet underlay

•

Power foundations

•

Components for office furniture

•

Drawn steel wire

•

Automotive seat support and lumbar systems

•

Bedding industry machinery for wire forming, sewing and quilting



PART I

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a
portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates
related to safety and environmental matters. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale
purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs. In instances
where our customers move production of their finished products overseas, our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently. We currently operate 10 facilities in China.

In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam.
We saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began. As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved. The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in
early 2009. The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be
sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of
products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing
antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.

We
experienced a temporary loss of market share during the last half of 2010 as certain of our customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from European suppliers. The opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted
from a combination of factors that benefited European suppliers in the early summer: i) the weaker Euro, ii) temporarily lower raw material costs in Europe, and iii) greater excess capacity as a result of last summer’s economic turmoil in
Europe. Because of the slowing of consumer demand for mattresses in the last half of 2010, it took longer for these imported products to be consumed, but by year-end, we had regained the majority of the volume.

Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not
experienced significant seasonality. The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses. Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third
quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower. However, in 2010, sales in the first and second quarters were higher on strength in our Residential Furnishings and Commercial
Fixturing & Components segments. Consumer demand for bedding and furniture was stronger during the first half of the year, we believe in part due to larger income tax refunds and home purchasing incentives. Demand for store fixtures was
also



PART I

stronger in the first half of the year, as retailers increased store remodeling activity (a larger portion of which occurred in the earlier part of the year) and decreased new store construction.
Notwithstanding 2010, our four segments tend to experience seasonality as follows:

•

Residential Furnishings:

typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and
furniture during those periods.

•

Commercial Fixturing & Components:

generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the first and fourth
quarters normally lower. This aligns with the retail industry’s normal construction cycle—the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.

•

Industrial Materials:

minimal variation in sales throughout the year.

•

Specialized Products:

relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in
the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.

Backlog

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our
segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.

Working Capital Items

For further information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of “Cash from Operations” in Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 48.

Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in
compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital
expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

The U.S. Congress has considered legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall green house gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. Similar initiatives have also been pursued at
the state level. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a determination that green house gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment. It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon
dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation. However, if enacted, this type of program could materially



PART I

increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation and electricity. In that event, our intent would be to raise prices in order to cover the cost increases.

Internet Access to Information

We routinely post information for investors to our website
(www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as
reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters
for its Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors can be found on our website. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Discontinued Operations

Several of our prior businesses are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations
since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing
involvement in the operations of the businesses. The discontinued operations include:

•

Aluminum Products segment.

We divested this segment in July 2008. It produced and sold non-automotive aluminum, zinc and magnesium die castings,
and new and refurbished dies (also known as molds or tools) for all types and sizes of die casting machines. It also provided machining, coating, finishing, sub-assembly and other value-added services for die cast components. These products and
services were sold into various end markets.

•

Wood Products unit, Fibers unit and the Coated Fabrics unit (each previously reported in the Residential Furnishings segment).

(i)

We divested the Wood Products unit in the third quarter of 2008. It sold wood frames and cut-to-size dimension lumber to bedding manufacturers.

(ii)

We divested the Fibers unit in the fourth quarter of 2008. It sold fiber cushioning material primarily to bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers.

(iii)

We divested the Coated Fabrics unit in the third quarter of 2009. It sold non-slip rug underlay and shelf liners primarily to retailers and distributors.

•

Plastics unit and the Storage Products unit (each previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment).

(i)

The Plastics unit, which was divested in the third quarter of 2008, sold injection molded plastic components primarily for manufacturers of lawn care equipment and
power tools.

(ii)

The Storage Products unit was divested in the third quarter of 2010. It sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and healthcare industries.



PART I

•

An automotive seating components operation and the dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit (each previously reported in the
Specialized Products segment)

.

(i)

The automotive seating components operation, which we divested in the first quarter of 2008, sold welded assemblies, and wire and tubular frames for automotive seating.

(ii)

We divested the dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit in the third quarter of 2008. It sold truck bodies for cargo vans, flatbed trucks, service trucks
and dump trucks primarily to end-users of light-to-medium duty commercial trucks.

For further information on discontinued operations, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below
and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to
time by other reports we file with the SEC.

We have exposure to economic
and other factors that affect market demand for our products.

As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns. Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and
products. Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence. To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing
turnover, energy costs and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts
approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand
weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses. Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by
consumers around the world. Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition,
operating cash flows and results of operations.

Deteriorating financial
condition of our customers could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

We serve customers in a variety of industries, some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand due to a weak
global economy. A sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could adversely impact our sales, net earnings, financial
condition, cash flow and liquidity.



PART I

Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results.

Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to
cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs move with the market. When we experience significant increases in
raw material costs, we implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Also, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through
reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings.

Steel is our most significant raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years. This
volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year. Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap. We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent
years.

Higher raw material costs in recent years
led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods. In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components. This has primarily impacted our
Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins. This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.

We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.

Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance
sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and
balance sheets.

Asian and European competition could adversely affect
our operating results.

We operate in markets
that are highly competitive. We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well. We face
ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe. If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of
foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed.

Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment.

A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we
determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2010, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $1.08 billion, or approximately 36% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment, sundry
assets and non-current assets held for sale totaled approximately $700 million, or approximately 23% of total assets.



PART I

We review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of
our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or
circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. The annual goodwill
impairment review performed in June 2010 indicated no goodwill impairments. At December 31, 2010, goodwill associated with reporting units whose fair values exceeded the carrying value by 10-25% was approximately $190 million; and $740 million
of goodwill was associated with reporting units that had fair values in excess of the carrying values by greater than 25%.

For the year ended 2010, other long-lived asset impairments were $2.4 million, of which $1.5 million was recognized in continuing
operations.

If actual results differ from the
assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our results of operations.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk.

We expect that international sales will continue to represent
a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2010, 28% of our sales from continuing operations were generated by international operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign
operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Further, our
competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our
future operations and financial results.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

The Company’s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri. At December 31, 2010, we had 222 production, warehouse, sales
and administrative facilities associated with continuing operations, of which 157 were located across the United States and 65 were located in foreign countries.



PART I

Properties by Location and Segment

Properties by Use and Segment


Includes some multi-purpose facilities with additional warehouse, sales and/or administrative uses.

Facilities that we own produced approximately 70% of our
sales from continuing operations in 2010. We also lease many of our production, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs). For additional information regarding lease
obligations, see Note K on page 102 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the opinion of management the Company’s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products. Our properties are located to allow
quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base. Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels. We face decisions about further facility consolidation but have chosen to
retain excess capacity because we believe that eventually market demand will improve. With our currently low utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate that demand improvement up to approximately $4 billion in revenue (assuming
current sales mix).

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.

The information in Note T on
page 121 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.

Item 4. (Removed and Reserved).

PART II

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

2010 HIGHLIGHTS

Demand improved in many of our markets during 2010. The
automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009. Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong. Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened
in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger-ticket items slowed.

Improved market demand led to higher sales and earnings in 2010. Activities completed over the past few years (including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain
underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins, and other cost reduction initiatives) improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from the higher volume.

During 2010, we completed the sale of the seventh, and final
divestiture identified as a part of our strategic realignment. The seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds (over the past three years), exceeding our original $400 million goal.

Operating cash for the full year significantly
exceeded the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends. Our focus on return optimization was reflected in part through the low level of working capital that was maintained as sales began to recover. In August, we raised the
quarterly dividend to $.27 per share and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases at a 14% compound annual growth rate. We also repurchased over 6 million shares of our stock during 2010.

Our financial profile remains strong. We ended 2010 with net
debt to net capital well below our long-term targeted range, no significant fixed term debt maturing until 2013, and over $500 million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility.

We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total
Shareholder Return (TSR), on a rolling three-year basis, to that of peer companies. We target TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require average TSR of 12-15% per year. For the three years
ended December 31, 2010, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, which places us in the top 8% of the S&P 500.

These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.

INTRODUCTION

What We Do

Leggett & Platt is a diversified manufacturer, and member of the S&P 500 index, that conceives, designs, and produces a wide
range of engineered components and products found in most homes, offices, and automobiles, and many retail stores. We make components that are often hidden within, but integral to, our customers’ products.

We are the leading U.S. manufacturer of: components for
residential furniture and bedding, power foundations, carpet underlay, components for office furniture, drawn steel wire, automotive seat support and lumbar systems, and bedding industry machinery.

Our Segments

Our continuing operations are composed of 19 business units in four segments, with approximately 19,000
employees and 140 production facilities located in 18 countries around the world. Our segments are described below.

Residential Furnishings

This segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by
bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. We also sell carpet cushion, power foundations, bed frames, ornamental beds, and geo components.

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Operations in this segment manufacture and sell store
fixtures and point-of-purchase displays used in retail stores. We also produce chair controls, bases, and other components for office furniture manufacturers, as well as select lines of private-label finished furniture.



PART II

Industrial Materials

These operations primarily supply steel rod, drawn steel
wire, steel billets, and welded steel tubing to other Leggett operations and to external customers. Our customers use this wire and tubing to make bedding, furniture, automotive seats, mechanical springs, and many other end products. We also supply
fabricated wire products, such as shaped wire for automotive and medical supply application; tying heads, boxed wire, and parts for automatic baling equipment; coated wire products, including dishwasher racks, and wire retail fixtures and
point-of-purchase displays.

Specialized Products

From this segment we supply lumbar support systems and seat
suspension systems used by automotive seating manufacturers. We manufacture and install the racks, shelving and cabinets used to outfit fleets of service vans. We also produce quilting, sewing, and wire forming machinery, some of which is used by
other Leggett operations as well as external customers, including bedding manufacturers.

Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

During the past three years, we divested seven businesses (approximately 15% of our portfolio) that we identified as a part of the strategic realignment announced in late 2007 (discussed below). In 2008,
we sold our Aluminum Products segment and four smaller business units (Wood Products, Fibers, Plastics, and the dealer portion of Commercial Vehicle Products). In 2009, we sold the Coated Fabrics business unit, and in 2010 we divested the Storage
Products business unit. We received after-tax cash proceeds of $433 million for these seven businesses, exceeding our original estimate of approximately $400 million. Results of operations for all of these businesses are classified as
discontinued operations in our financial statements. For more information about discontinued operations and the divestitures, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.

Strategic Direction

In late 2007, we outlined significant changes to the Company’s strategy. We adopted a new primary financial metric (Total Shareholder
Return), adopted role-based portfolio management, implemented more rigorous strategic planning, and changed the priorities for use of cash. Our goals, in sequential order, were to i) divest low performing businesses, ii) return more cash to
investors, iii) improve margins and returns, and iv) begin to carefully and conservatively grow the company at 4-5% of annual revenue. We have made significant progress over the past three years. The divestitures were largely complete by the end of
2008; margins and returns have improved; and we have returned much of our excess cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. Our focus now is two-part: i) continue improving margins, and ii) begin laying the groundwork
for long-term 4-5% growth.

Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) is the key financial measure that we use to monitor performance. TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price]. We seek to achieve TSR in
the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach



PART II

that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases. In 2008, dividends and stock buybacks largely drove our TSR; during 2009, we benefited
significantly from margin improvement; and in 2010, revenue growth (from improved market demand) boosted TSR. Beginning in 2008, we introduced TSR-based incentives (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of 320 peers)
for senior executives and we modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control. We monitor our TSR performance, relative to the S&P 500, on a rolling three-year basis. For
the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, our TSR performance placed us within the top 8% of the S&P 500 companies. So far, for the first two years of the next three-year measurement period (which will end on December 31, 2011),
our TSR performance ranks slightly above the midpoint (but not among the top one-third) of the companies in the S&P 500.

We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation
priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market
attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as EBITDA growth, operating cash flows, and return on assets. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently
generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.

The majority of our business units are categorized as
“Core”. A smaller percentage are categorized as “Grow”; consequently, we recognize as a strategic imperative the need to expand the Grow category by improving i) our success rate at developing innovative new products and ii) our
abilities to identify new growth platforms. A few small business units are considered “Fix”, and must improve their performance within a reasonable time frame. Finally, a few small business units (or portions of business units) are
considered non-strategic, and may be divested as the M&A market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices.

Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To attain this goal, we will need to supplement
the approximate 2%-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity. First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in
which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us, and in which Leggett would possess a competitive advantage. These growth efforts are receiving significant
management attention and priority, and we are making progress in both areas. We have had success this past year, with new products introduced in our office components, automotive, and home furniture components businesses. Though individually those
were modest successes, collectively they added to 2010’s sales and earnings growth. In addition, we have instituted some of the processes that need to be in place to identify new market opportunities. Successful development of new growth
platforms will take time; we do not anticipate significant contributions from these activities in the near term.

The strategic changes have increased available cash. We expect to continue returning much of this cash to shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases.



PART II

Customers

We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing 6% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely
recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.

Major Factors That Impact Our Business

Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and
competition.

Market Demand

Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several
economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates. All these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and
therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand improved in many of our markets during 2010. The
automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009. Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong. Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened
in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger-ticket items slowed.

Improved market demand led to higher sales and earnings in 2010. Activities completed over the past few years (including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain
underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins, and other cost reduction initiatives) improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from higher sales. Capacity utilization levels in
the majority of our operations remain low. We face decisions about possible further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that market demand will continue to improve. Our current productive capacity
should readily accommodate sales of approximately $4 billion (assuming current sales mix), or levels roughly 20% higher than those of 2010. Until our productive capacity is fully utilized, each additional $100 million of sales (from incremental unit
volume) should generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.

Raw Material Costs

In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials. This purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have. Still, our
costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.

Purchasing arrangements vary across the company. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw
material costs generally move with the market. In certain of our businesses, we have longer-term purchase contracts with



PART II

pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions. However, when commodities experience extreme inflation, vendors do not always honor those contracts.

Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price
increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to
our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.

Steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost
fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. Significant steel cost increases in 2008 were followed by significant cost decreases in
2009 as global economies weakened. In both cases, we generally adjusted pricing to our customers to reflect the changes in commodity costs. In late 2009 and early 2010, steel costs increased, and again we implemented price increases to recover the
majority of the higher costs. By the end of 2010, we were facing further inflation in steel costs, and announced and began implementing additional price increases in early 2011.

As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by
volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap
costs. As a result, metal margins within the steel industry (and in our rod producing operation) were lower during 2010. We anticipate further compression in these margins in early 2011 as scrap costs have increased again in recent months.

Our other raw materials include woven and
non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers. In late 2010 these costs increased, and in early 2011
we announced and began implementing price increases to recover the higher costs.

When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We experienced
this de-contenting effect in our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials segments in recent years. As our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address steel and chemical inflation, our profit
margins were negatively impacted. We are responding by developing new products (including new types of mattress innersprings, boxsprings, and reclining chair mechanisms) that enable our customers to reduce their total costs, and in certain
instances, provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.

Competition

Many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be
smaller, private companies.

We believe we gain
competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations, significant internal production of key raw materials, manufacturing expertise



PART II

and product innovation, higher quality products, extensive customer service capabilities, and financial strength. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the
basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering product quality, innovation, and customer service.

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products
offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters. We
typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs. In instances where our customers move production of their
finished products overseas, our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently. We currently operate 10 facilities in China.

In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam. We saw a distinct decline
in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began. As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved. The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009. The current
antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices,
however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active
antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or
countervailing duty orders.

We experienced a
temporary loss of market share during the last half of 2010 as certain of our customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from European suppliers. The opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted from a
combination of factors that benefited European suppliers in the early summer: i) the weaker Euro; ii) temporarily lower wire costs; and iii) greater excess capacity as a result of economic turmoil in Europe. Because of the slowing of consumer
demand for mattresses in the last half of 2010, it took longer for these imported products to be consumed, but by year-end, we had regained the majority of the lost volume.



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2010 vs. 2009

During 2010, sales from continuing operations increased 10%, reflecting improved market demand in several of
our businesses. Full-year earnings from continuing operations also increased, from $121 million in 2009 to $184 million in 2010.

Further details about our consolidated and segment results from continuing operations are discussed below.

Consolidated Results (continuing operations)

The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings
from continuing operations during 2010, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.

In 2010, sales from continuing operations increased 10% versus 2009. Demand improved in many of our end markets during the year. The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant
improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009. Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong. Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on
larger-ticket items slowed.



PART II

Full-year earnings from continuing operations increased in 2010, primarily reflecting
higher unit volumes, a lower effective tax rate, and the non-recurrence of three significant expense items from 2009 (detailed in the table above). These earnings improvements were partially offset by lower metal margins. As a producer of steel rod,
we are impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace
with escalating scrap costs. As a result, metal margins within the steel industry (and in our rod producing operation) were lower during 2010.

LIFO Impact

All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made
at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. We experienced a large swing in the LIFO impact during
the past two years. In 2009, significant steel cost decreases resulted in a LIFO benefit of $67 million. In 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense of $15 million. The LIFO impact recognized at the corporate level is generally offset
each year by FIFO impacts at the segment level. Segment-level earnings in 2009 were significantly burdened (primarily in the first half of the year) as we consumed higher cost steel while selling prices decreased. In 2010, segment-level earnings
benefitted under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs.

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense was roughly flat with 2009.

The consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for 2010 was lower, at 28.1%, versus 39.0% in 2009. In 2010, the tax rate benefitted
from the higher level of earnings, changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, and tentative settlements of tax examinations. During the year, we reached tentative agreement with the IRS on their examination of certain tax credit claims,
and recognized tax benefits of $5 million associated with those claims. These benefits were partially offset by incremental taxes resulting from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. During 2010, we repatriated $108 million of foreign
earnings, which resulted in a net tax charge of $5 million. In 2009, the higher tax rate reflected unfavorable tax adjustments resulting from Mexican tax law changes, which caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that
jurisdiction. As a result, we recorded a $6 million tax charge to earnings related to 2009 and prior year losses that might expire before they could be utilized to reduce taxable earnings.



PART II

Segment Results (continuing operations)

In the following section we discuss 2010 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from continuing
operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 94.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales increased in 2010, primarily due to market share gains in our furniture components business. Demand in most of our residential markets was relatively strong during the first
half of the year but weakened noticeably in the last half as consumer demand for large ticket items (such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture) slowed.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus 2009, with the earnings impact from higher unit volumes augmented by pricing discipline,
significantly reduced bad debt expense, and a benefit associated with the sale of a building.

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Sales increased in 2010 due to relatively strong demand in our Store Fixtures business by value-oriented retailers, and improved market demand in Office Furniture Components.

EBIT and EBIT margins also increased versus the prior year,
largely due to higher sales.



PART II

Industrial Materials

2010 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and improved market demand.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2009, as higher sales were more than offset by lower metal margins within the steel industry.

Specialized Products

Sales increased in 2010, reflecting improved demand across all the major businesses in the segment.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales bolstered by cost reductions.

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax,
increased $5 million, from a loss of $6 million in 2009 to a loss of $1 million in 2010. This earnings increase was primarily due to the non-recurrence of $3 million (net of tax) of environmental charges related to an aluminum property and lower
long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges associated with the divestitures (which are now complete).



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2009 vs. 2008

During 2009, sales from continuing operations decreased 25%, reflecting a combination of weak market demand,
steel-related price deflation, and our decision to exit some specific sales with unacceptable margins. In the majority of our global markets, demand stabilized at low levels in early 2009.

Despite the significant sales decline, full-year earnings from continuing operations decreased only modestly,
from $128 million in 2008 to $121 million in 2009. Cost structure improvements and pricing discipline offset nearly all the impact from lower sales.

Further details about our consolidated and segment results from continuing operations are discussed below.

Consolidated Results (continuing operations)

The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings
from continuing operations during 2009, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.

Sales from continuing operations decreased 25% versus 2008, reflecting weak market demand, inflation-related price decreases, and our decision to exit specific customer



PART II

programs with unacceptable profit margins (the largest portion in our Store Fixtures business).

Full-year earnings from continuing operations also decreased in 2009. The earnings impact from lower unit volume was largely offset by
cost reduction initiatives and pricing discipline. Other factors impacting the year-over-year earnings comparison are presented in the table above. The divestiture note write-down (identified in the table) occurred when we learned in 2009 that the
aluminum operations divested in July 2008 needed a capital infusion from the buyer due to deterioration in business conditions. This led to a reduction in the value of the note we accepted in 2008 as partial payment for the divesture. Leggett
accepted a more subordinate position in the capital structure of the divested operations.

LIFO Impact

All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert
about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. We experienced large swings in the LIFO impact in recent years. In 2008, significant steel cost inflation along with
moderately higher inventory levels resulted in LIFO expense from continuing operations of $62 million. In 2009, steel cost decreases and lower inventory levels resulted in a LIFO benefit from continuing operations of $67 million. The LIFO impact
recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each year by FIFO impacts at the segment level. Segment-level earnings in 2008 generally benefited under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs, but in the first half of 2009,
were significantly burdened as we consumed higher cost steel while selling prices decreased.

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense decreased $8 million versus 2008, primarily the result of lower commercial paper borrowings and lower interest rates
in 2009.

The consolidated worldwide effective
income tax rate for 2009 was higher, at 39.0%, versus 33.8% in 2008. This increase is primarily due to i) tax adjustments resulting from Mexican tax law changes, and ii) the lower level of earnings and mix among tax jurisdictions. In 2009, tax law
changes in Mexico caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction. As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6 million tax charge to earnings related to 2009 and prior year losses that may expire before
they can be utilized to reduce taxable earnings. In 2008, a tax benefit associated with the write-off of an acquired company’s stock was offset by increased reserves for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against deferred tax
assets for certain foreign entities.



PART II

Segment Results (continuing operations)

In the following section we discuss 2009 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from continuing
operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 94.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales decreased in 2009, reflecting weak market demand and steel-related price deflation. Demand in our residential markets was weak throughout 2009 as consumers world-wide
continued to defer purchases of large ticket items (such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture) that contain our products.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2008, with the earnings impact from significantly lower unit volumes partially offset by cost
reductions, pricing discipline, elimination of poorly performing operations, and the absence of 2008’s restructuring-related and other costs ($18 million).

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Sales decreased in 2009 due to our decision in the Store Fixtures business to exit specific customer programs with unacceptable margins, reduced capital spending by retailers, and market softness in
Office Furniture Components.

EBIT and EBIT
margins also decreased versus the prior year, as the impact from lower sales more than offset benefits from cost reductions, prior elimination of poorly performing facilities, and other operating improvements, as well as the absence of 2008’s
restructuring-related costs ($11 million).



PART II

Industrial Materials

2009 sales decreased, reflecting weak demand in many of our markets (including bedding, furniture, and automotive) and steel-related price deflation.

EBIT and EBIT margins also decreased versus 2008, as lower
sales more than offset cost reductions.

Specialized Products

Sales decreased in 2009, reflecting weak global demand in our markets.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus the prior year, as the impact from lower sales more than offset benefits from cost reduction
initiatives and other operating improvements, as well as the absence of 2008’s restructuring-related costs ($5 million).

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $13 million, from a loss of $19 million in 2008 to a loss of $6
million in 2009. This earnings increase was primarily due to lower asset impairments and restructuring-related charges, partially offset by $3 million (net of tax) of environmental charges related to an aluminum property.



PART II

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION

In this section, we provide details, reflecting both
continuing and discontinued operations, about our:

•

Uses of cash

•

Cash from operations

•

Debt position and total capitalization

We use cash for the following:

•

Finance capital requirements (e.g. productivity, growth and acquisitions)

•

Pay dividends

•

Repurchase our stock

Our operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs. In 2008, cash proceeds from
completed divestitures were an additional significant source of funds. In 2009, we generated our second highest level of cash from operations in our history, at $565 million, which included a significant reduction in working capital as sales
contracted. With a slight increase in working capital in 2010 (due to sales growth), operating cash was $363 million, still readily exceeding our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends. For 2011, we expect cash flow from
operations to again exceed $300 million. We ended 2010 with net debt to net capital of 23.3%, its lowest level since 2004 and well below our long-term target of 30%-40%. Page 51 presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of
net capital at the end of the past two years.

Uses of Cash

Finance Capital Requirements

Improving returns of the existing asset base will continue
to be a key focus. However, cash is available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).



PART II

Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand
manufacturing capacity. The chart above shows that capital expenditures have declined in recent years; they should approximate $85 million in 2011. In all of our businesses, we continue to invest in the maintenance of facilities and equipment.
However, with the sales volume contraction (versus 2008 levels) and the resulting excess productive capacity across our operations, we have significantly reduced spending on expansion projects in recent years.

With the move to role-based portfolio management, we changed
our long-term priorities for allocating capital and this has also impacted capital spending levels. We are actively pursuing disciplined growth within our Grow business units. Expansion capital is predominantly earmarked for these opportunities.
Operations designated as Core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements.

We are also seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets
(carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). During the past few years, acquisitions were a lower priority as we were primarily focused on completing the divestitures and improving margins and returns of our existing businesses. As a
result of this temporarily lower priority, and more stringent screening criteria, no significant acquisitions were completed in 2008, 2009, and 2010. We have recently turned our focus back toward acquisitions and have begun actively soliciting
opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline. We expect acquisitions to contribute modestly to our long-term growth. Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 118.

Pay Dividends

With continued improvement in
margins and returns, a decrease in capital spending and acquisitions, and the completion of the divestitures, we expect (and since 2008 have had) more available cash to return to shareholders. Higher annual dividends are one means by which that
should continue to occur. In 2010 we modestly increased the quarterly dividend, to $.27 per share, and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound growth rate of 14%. Our targeted dividend payout
is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, but has been higher recently and will



PART II

likely remain above targeted levels in the near term. Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority. We anticipate spending approximately $155 million on dividends in 2011,
roughly the same as in 2010, with expected share repurchases offsetting expected dividend increases. Cash from operations has been, and is expected to continue to be, sufficient to readily fund both capital expenditures and dividends.

Repurchase Stock

Share repurchases are the other
means by which we return cash to shareholders. During the past three years, we repurchased a total of 33 million shares of our stock and reduced outstanding shares by 13%. In 2010, we repurchased over 6 million shares at an average
per-share price of $21.64 and issued 4 million shares through employee benefit plans (most of these shares were purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation). We expect to repurchase additional shares in 2011, with the amount of
purchases dependent on factors such as general economic conditions, level of demand in our end markets, and the availability of excess cash. Although no specific repurchase schedule has been established, we have been authorized by the Board to
repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2011.



PART II

Cash from Operations

Cash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings
and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.

Meaningful sales and earnings
improvement contributed to our 2010 cash from operations, and was partially offset by increased working capital levels associated with those higher sales. Although working capital dollars increased, working capital as a percent of sales decreased
slightly from year-end 2009 levels. Cash from operations in 2009 benefitted from a $186 million reduction in working capital during that year (that occurred as a result of the economy-induced sales contraction).

The following table presents key working capital measures at
the end of the past two years.

(1)

The accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net
accounts receivable ÷ (net sales ÷ number of days in the year).

(2)

The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory
÷ (cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the year).

(3)

The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending
accounts payable ÷ (cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the year).

•

Accounts Receivable — The dollar amount of accounts receivable increased from year-end 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales. As part of our
accounts receivable review process, we evaluate individual customers’ payment histories, financial health, industry prospects, and current macroeconomic events in



PART II

determining if outstanding amounts are collectible. In 2010, we incurred $7 million of bad debt expense as compared to $30 million in 2009. The higher expense in 2009 was primarily due to a
single customer bankruptcy in the Residential Furnishings segment ($10 million) and the write-down of the aluminum segment divestiture note receivable ($11 million) as discussed on page 42.

•

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)—We experienced an increase in our DSO in 2009 as customers slowed payments during the economic downturn. Our DSO
decreased in 2010 as our markets began to improve, and we continued to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts were paid on time. We do not believe the decrease in DSO indicates a significant change in credit risk or has material
implications on our liquidity, but instead is caused by normal differences (from year to year) in the timing of sales and cash receipts.

•

Inventory—The dollar value of our inventories increased from year-end 2009 levels, primarily due to inflation in raw material costs. During 2010,
we recognized expense of $13 million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories; in 2009 this expense totaled $16 million. We do not expect significant changes in customer or industry trends that would materially increase the exposure to
inventory obsolescence.

•

Days Inventory on Hand (DIO)—Our DIO decreased compared to the prior year as our operations continue to focus on optimizing return on assets.

•

Accounts Payable—The dollar value of accounts payable increased in 2010 compared to year-end 2009, primarily due to inflation in raw material
costs and also from our continued efforts to optimize payment terms with our vendors.

•

Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)—Our DPO has increased slightly in 2010 as we continue to work with vendors to extend our standard payment terms.

Cash from operations in 2008
was strong despite weak market demand in the latter part of that year. Lower working capital (versus the prior year) contributed favorably to operating cash. Fourth quarter production cuts led to lower inventory levels (compared to year-end 2007).
Accounts receivable also declined primarily due to extremely weak sales late in that year.

Working capital levels vary by segment. The Commercial Fixturing & Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to
service certain customers of the Fixture & Display group. This business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs
of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.



PART II

Capitalization

This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.

(1)

These calculations include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the
averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.

(2)

Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in
operating leases. Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.

The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2010 and 2009, calculated in two ways:

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.



PART II

We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more
meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.

Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) decreased $35 million in 2010. During the year, we reduced our commercial paper borrowings by $25 million and paid off $10
million of other long-term debt that came due.

In
anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in 2010. The swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 million of future debt issuance, and mature in August
2012. The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% and hedge the benchmark rate of the future issuance of $200 million of debt. The credit spread over the benchmark bonds will continue to fluctuate until the contracts are settled (either
upon an issuance of debt or upon their expiration). For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 119.

Short Term Borrowings

We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600
million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 14 lenders that terminates in 2012. The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250 million. When we issue these letters of credit, our capacity under the agreement, and
consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:



PART II

The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2010 was $99
million and $198 million, respectively. Commercial paper amounts fluctuated during the year due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements. The amounts of letters of credit outstanding throughout the year were not materially different
from the amounts outstanding at year-end.

Based
on the information currently available to us, we believe that the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the revolving credit agreement. In the unlikely event that a disruption in the credit market was to
become so severe that we were unable to issue commercial paper, we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on the revolving credit agreement. In such event, the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could be higher than
the cost of commercial paper borrowing.

We also
maintain an active shelf registration. With anticipated operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our expected ability to issue debt through our active shelf, we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing
operations, pay dividends, repurchase stock, fund future growth, and repay maturing debt.

Accessibility of Cash

At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $244 million primarily invested in money market funds and interest-bearing bank accounts. A smaller portion was invested in bank time
deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

A substantial portion of these funds are held in international accounts and represent undistributed earnings from our foreign operations. The tax rules governing this area are complex. However, subject to
constantly changing facts and laws, we believe we could access a significant portion of the cash without material incremental cost.



PART II

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would
change, and some of those changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual
events, as they occur.

“Critical accounting
estimates” are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial
statements.

We provide additional details
regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.

CONTINGENCIES

Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the likelihood
that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost. Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.

NPI Lawsuit

On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc.
(“NPI”) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC (“Gamber”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video
contained false and misleading statements. NPI and Gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems. NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its
alleged lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber’s profits in an unspecified amount.

Although part of the claims were dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 million in
disgorgement damages against Gamber. On August 16, the Court: (a) reduced the jury verdict to approximately $0.5 million; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction
requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict. The Court subsequently awarded NPI $2.0 million in attorney’s fees and costs.

We believe that Gamber has valid bases upon which the appellate court could overturn the verdict and the award of attorney fees and costs.
We intend to vigorously pursue an appeal. NPI has also filed an appeal. We established an accrual for this suit in an amount we believe is probable. Also, we believe that it is probable that at least part of the verdict, attorney’s fees
and costs will be covered by insurance, but that coverage is subject to the insurance company’s reservation of rights.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper
County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284. The suit is substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009. The prior suit was dismissed without prejudice based on its failure to make
demand on the Company’s Board and shareholders. As before, the plaintiff has not made such demand.

The new suit was purportedly brought on the Company’s behalf, naming it as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former
officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell,
Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.

The
plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating the



PART II

company’s stock plans; caused or allowed the Company to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold Company stock while possessing material non-public
information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.

The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other
relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain Company corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants’ stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the
rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs. The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from the Company. The Company has director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and
exclusions.

The Company and the individual
defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late October, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on the Company’s Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the court’s ruling in the prior suit,
this failure to make demand should not be excused; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the suit is based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and Company stock prices that the Company believes is flawed; the plaintiff
failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under the Company’s Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed
with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date. The hearing on the motions to dismiss is scheduled for March 15, 2011.

We expect that the outcome of this suit will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Antitrust Lawsuits

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that competitors of the Company’s carpet underlay division and other manufacturers of
polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. To date, over 40 cases have been filed on behalf of purchasers of polyurethane foam products against over 20 defendants. The Company has been named as a
defendant in six cases; five of which have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MD-02196. The first case in which the
Company was named as a party: Martin Furniture & Bedding, Inc. v. FXI-Foamex Innovations, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:10-cv-00178 (Western District of North Carolina) was instituted on November 15, 2010, and is also expected to be
transferred.

In the suits to which the Company is
a party, the plaintiffs, on behalf of the class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products during the period



PART II

1979 to the present in one case, and from at least 2001 to the present in the other five cases. Each plaintiff also seeks attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court
costs, and injunctive relief against future violations. We expect the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in the consolidated case on or before February 28, 2011.

The Company denies all of the allegations and will vigorously
defend itself. This contingency is subject to many uncertainties. Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any. At this time, we do not believe that it is probable
that the outcome will have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

We adopted new accounting guidance in 2010 as discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 83. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.

About Market Risk.

(Unaudited)

(Dollar amounts in millions)

Interest Rates

The table below provides information about the Company’s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. Substantially all
of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its carrying value by $6.0 at December 31, 2010, and less than its carrying value by $71.1 at December 31,
2009. The increase in the fair market value of the Company’s debt is primarily due to the decrease in credit spreads over risk-free rates as compared to the prior year end. The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg
secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2010 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated “spread” over such Treasury securities representing the Company’s interest costs under its medium-term note program. The fair
value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.

Includes $0 and $25 of commercial paper in 2010 and 2009, respectively, supported by a $600 revolving credit agreement which terminates in 2012.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is subject to market and financial risks related
to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks. The Company seeks to use derivative contracts
that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is the Company’s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments. Information regarding cash flow hedges, fair value
hedges and net investment hedges is provided in Note S on page 119 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.

Investment in Foreign Subsidiaries

The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a
long-term commitment, and does not hedge translation exposures. The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes. The Company’s net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to
translation exposure) in foreign subsidiaries, including those held for sale, at December 31 is as follows:

Effectiveness of the Company’s Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation as of December 31, 2010
was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective, as of December 31, 2010, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the
time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Directors of the Company

Directors are elected annually at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders and hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. All current directors have been nominated for re-election at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held
May 12, 2011. If a nominee fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in the director election, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the
director’s resignation and whether any other action should be taken. If a director’s resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company’s next annual meeting and his or her successor is duly
elected and qualified. If the Board accepts the director’s resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy.

PART IV

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
Leggett & Platt;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of Leggett & Platt are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Leggett & Platt; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett & Platt
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of
management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report appearing on page 73 of this Form 10-K.



PART IV

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are



PART IV

being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“we” or “our”). Prior to 2010, many subsidiaries outside of the United States were consolidated as of and for a fiscal
year ended November 30. As of December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries converted to a calendar reporting year. The net impact of the change in fiscal years of these subsidiaries was immaterial, and is presented as an adjustment to
January 1, 2010 retained earnings. Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the
United States. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with
original maturities of three months or less.

ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and
generally do not bear interest. Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a trade note receivable to facilitate our customers’ operating cycles. Nontrade notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial
payment for the sale of a business. Notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.

The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the
amount of probable credit losses. Interest income is not recognized for accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status. Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several
factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience. Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for
nonaccrual status accounts. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.

INVENTORIES: All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and
production overhead at normal production capacity. The cost for approximately 60% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of
steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap. For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs. For these inventories, the FIFO cost at December 31, 2010 and
2009 approximated expected replacement cost.



Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items
using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value. Reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory on a FIFO basis were as follows:

DIVESTITURES: Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:

Discontinued Operations

—A business is classified
as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified
as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions. Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for
discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.

If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the
income statement. Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations. Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in
continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.

Assets Held for Sale

—An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate
sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to
events or circumstances beyond our control. Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed. Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined
order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed. After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the
lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The assets and related liabilities are aggregated
and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.

Assets Held for Use

—If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use. Assets of the business are evaluated
for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill. In evaluating the recoverability of property and
intangible assets subject to amortization, in a held for use business, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition. If the carrying value exceeds the
undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.



PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal. The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.

Life

Average Life

Machinery and equipment

3-20 years

Property is tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not
be recoverable as discussed above.

GOODWILL:
Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur. We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year. Recoverability of goodwill
is evaluated using a two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Reporting units are business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial
information is available and reviewed by segment management.

If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that
group. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary
to estimate the fair values of the business groups. In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price to earnings
ratios. Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, internal sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements. Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but
not the only factor, in our assessment. There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in
value may occur in the future.

OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS: Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 40 years with a weighted average of 15 years and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar
to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. Expense is recognized net of
an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award.

SALES RECOGNITION: We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination. The timing of
our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination. We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers nor is it our practice to
replace goods damaged or lost in transit. Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of “Cost of
goods sold.”



RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract
termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities. Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities. We recognize a liability for
costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred. Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.

INCOME TAXES: The provision for income taxes is determined
using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The
provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and
are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized. A provision is also
made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.

The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax
liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management’s
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we
determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F. Operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Asia, Europe, Canada and Latin
America.

We maintain allowances for potential
credit losses. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged. Management also monitors the financial condition and status
of noncustomer receivables. Noncustomer receivables primarily consist of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business. Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.

We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product
warranties which require disclosure.

From time to
time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt. To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet
certain requirements are used. We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.

The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.

OTHER RISKS: Although we obtain insurance for
workers’ compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles. Accrued liabilities include estimates for
unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported. Provisions for losses are recorded based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party
administrators and insurance carriers.



DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage
market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify
for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for
entering into the hedge transaction. The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis
thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred
gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in “Other current” or “Sundry” assets or “Other current” or “Other long-term” liabilities.

On the date the contract is entered into, we
designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:

Cash Flow Hedge—

The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the hedged item impacts
the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged
item. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item. Cash flow hedges are presented as operating cash flows
when the contracts are settled.

Fair Value
Hedge—

The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge. For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative,
along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item. Fair value hedges are presented as
operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.

Net Investment Hedge—

The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is designated as a net investment hedge. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives, based
upon spot rates, used as a net investment hedge of a foreign operation is recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of an instrument designated
as a net investment hedge is recorded as “Other (income) expense, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net investment hedges are presented as investing cash flows when the contracts are settled.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The functional currency for
most foreign operations is the local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using
monthly average exchange rates. The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE: In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments designed to improve
disclosures about fair value measurements. The amendments require



new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and separate disclosure about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of Level 3 fair value
measurements. The amendments also require clarification of existing disclosures for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements (Level 2 or Level 3). These disclosures were effective January 1, 2010, except for the disclosures about
purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 measurements. Those disclosures are effective January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements and
is not expected to have a material impact on future financial statements.

In July 2010, the FASB issued disclosure requirements regarding credit risk exposures and allowance for credit losses. Required additional disclosures are included in Note H and did not have a material
impact on our financial statements.

The FASB has
issued other accounting guidance effective for future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe any of the other new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.

B—Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale

Exit activities associated with an extensive review of our business portfolio in 2007 (referred to as the 2007
Strategic Plan, which included the divestiture of several operations, the pruning of some business and the closure of certain underperforming plants) were substantially complete by the end of 2008. However, a small amount of subsequent activity
directly related to these divestitures continued into 2009 and 2010, including the 2009 write-down of a promissory note received in connection with the 2008 Aluminum Products segment divestiture as discussed below. All other activity is reported
within earnings from discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. Segments in which these operations were previously reported are detailed in the table below.

Divestitures completed during the years presented are as
follows:


•

Storage Products unit—No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.


•

Coated Fabrics unit—No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.


•

Fibers unit—The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $8.6 ($7.8 loss net of tax).

•

Aluminum Products segment—This segment was sold for $300.0 in cash, a $25.0 subordinated promissory note (fair value of $14.1), and shares of
preferred stock (no book value, with face value not to exceed $25.0, dependent upon future performance of the divested business). The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7.6 ($16.0 gain after taxes).

In 2009, we learned that this business needed a capital
infusion due to deterioration in business conditions and determined that the collectability of the promissory note was not reasonably assured. We recorded a $10.6 non-cash reduction in the value of the promissory note that is reported in “Other
expense (income), net” on the Statements of Operations. On June 30, 2009, we surrendered the promissory note, and in exchange, received $15.0 face amount (fair value of $3.5) of redeemable preferred stock. The fair value estimate
incorporated various inputs related to the aluminum operations including: historical financial information, assumptions about future revenue, earnings, and cash flows and earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar
characteristics. Management believes it was in our best interest to accept the preferred stock in exchange for the promissory note due to the higher likelihood of recovery resulting from the modification to the buyer’s capital structure.



•

Wood Products unit—The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.1 ($4.4 loss net of tax).

•

Plastics unit—The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $9.4 ($6.7 loss net of tax).

•

The dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit—No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.

•

One automotive seating components operation—The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2.5 ($1.7 loss net of tax).

In addition to the divestitures
discussed above, we also sold our Prime Foam Products Unit in 2007. Results from discontinued operations and activity directly related to these divestitures subsequent to the date of sale for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

(1)

Goodwill and other impairment charges were recorded to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as discussed in Note C.

(2)

In 2009 we recorded charges for an environmental issue related to an aluminum property that was sold prior to the divestiture of this business.



Net assets held for sale by segment at December 31 were as follows:

These tables include $24.9 and $22.2 of property, plant and equipment held for sale at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily associated with the closings of various operations and prior
year restructurings not associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan. These amounts also include land and buildings retained when we divested the Aluminum Products segment. Although market conditions have delayed the sale of these properties, we are
fully committed to selling and are actively marketing these assets.

The major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

C—Impairment Charges

Goodwill

Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year or as triggering events may occur. We perform our annual goodwill
impairment review in June of each year as discussed in Note A.

Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value
assigned to each reporting unit. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value.
Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after tax cash flows for each reporting unit. These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.

The market approach estimates fair value by first
determining price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit. The price to earnings ratio for



comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years. The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a
25% control premium. Projected earnings are based upon market analysts’ projections. The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value. Management believes this approach is
appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.

The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free)
cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows. Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s
expected long-term operating cash flow performance. Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in
operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.

2010 and 2009 Goodwill Impairment Reviews

The goodwill impairment reviews performed in June 2010 and 2009 indicated no goodwill impairments, and there were no triggering events in
either year that required additional goodwill reviews. Reporting units’ fair values in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in these reviews are presented in the tables below. If actual results differ
from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.

Reporting units’ fair values in relation to their respective carrying values were:



2008 Goodwill Impairment Reviews

The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2008
indicated no goodwill impairments.

The
deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the associated revision to earnings as a result of lower demand was considered a triggering event. An interim goodwill impairment analysis was performed in the
fourth quarter 2008 that confirmed fair values exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. Future cash flow assumptions were reduced to reflect lowered sales and production levels for 2009 and 2010, returning to historical levels thereafter.
Other significant assumptions used in the 2008 fourth quarter review are presented in the table below.

Businesses Held for Sale

In November 2007, we determined that we would exit certain of our business activities, and adopted a new strategic plan as discussed in Note B. As presented in the table below, asset impairment charges
were recorded as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell for the targeted divestitures became more certain. Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers. Deterioration in the
economy and credit markets and the impact on available credit for potential buyers in the last half of 2008 were also considerations in our 2008 fair value estimates.

Other Long-Lived Assets

As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are tested
for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

We have recorded various impairments for property, plant and equipment as presented in the table below which did not individually result
in a material charge to earnings for the periods presented. An impairment of $9.5 was recognized in 2008 associated with a Latin America supply agreement due to a significant reduction in the expected future cash flows associated with these
agreements. Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers for fixed assets and discounted cash flows for intangible assets.



The pre-tax impact of impairment charges on continuing and discontinued operations is
summarized in the following table. Asset impairments associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Impairment of goodwill” and “Other (income) expense, net.” Charges associated with
discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.” Of the total impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, $.9, $3.0 and $32.3,
respectively, were associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan.



D—Restructuring

We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures. These cost initiatives have,
among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations. Except for the “2007 Strategic Plan” described below, none of these initiatives have individually resulted in a material charge to
earnings for any of the periods presented. Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended December 31 were comprised of:

2007 Strategic Plan

As discussed in Note B, in November 2007, we adopted a strategic plan which included the exit of certain businesses. These exit activities were substantially complete by the end of 2008.

The following table contains information, by segment,
regarding the amount of each major type of restructuring-related cost incurred in connection with the exit activities.



Restructuring charges are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Other (income)
expense, net.” Inventory obsolescence associated with continuing operations are reported in “Cost of goods sold” and are presented in the table below. Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of
Operations in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.”

(1)

Primarily plant closure and asset relocation.

The accrued liability associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan consisted of the following:



Other Initiatives

Apart from the 2007 Strategic Plan, we have implemented
various cost reduction initiatives over the last three years to improve our operating cost structures. None of these actions has individually resulted in a material charge to earnings. Total costs associated with these other initiatives have had the
following impact on our financial statements:

For the years ended 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, restructuring and restructuring-related charges (income) associated with continuing operations by segment were as follows:

The accrued liability associated with Other Initiatives consisted of the following:



E—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as
follows:

Goodwill impairment charges are outlined in Note C.

Intangible assets purchased during the periods presented included in “Other intangibles” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:



The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset
class are as follows:

Estimated amortization expense for continuing operations in each of the next five years is as follows:

F—Segment Information

We have four operating segments that are generally focused on broad end-user markets for our diversified products. Residential Furnishings
derives its revenues from components for bedding, furniture and other furnishings, as well as related consumer products. Commercial Fixturing & Components derives its revenues from retail store fixtures, displays and components for office
and institutional furnishings. Industrial Materials derives its revenues from drawn steel wire, specialty wire products and welded steel tubing sold to trade customers as well as other Leggett segments. Specialized Products derives its revenues from
automotive seating components, specialized machinery and equipment, and commercial vehicle interiors.

Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Each
reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating decision maker. The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief
operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.

Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which
is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.

The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial
statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory. Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate performance based on earnings
from operations before interest and income taxes (EBIT). Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the
segment. Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales and EBIT. These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related
to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.



A summary of segment results for the periods presented are shown in the following tables.



Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for
return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance. These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment. Segment assets for all years are reflected at their
estimated average for the year. Acquired companies’ long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.

Primarily goodwill, other intangibles, cash and long-term notes receivable.



Revenues from external customers, by product line, are as follows:

Our operations outside of the United States are principally in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico. The geographic information that follows is based on the area of manufacture.



G—Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:



H—Accounts and Other Receivables

Accounts and other receivables at December 31 consisted
of the following:

Notes are evaluated individually for impairment, and at December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had no significant impaired notes. There were no past due amounts related to notes received as partial payment for
divestitures. Past due amounts for other notes were less than $3.0 at December 31, 2010, of which approximately $1.0 had been placed on non-accrual status.

Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected below:

*

As discussed in Note B, we recorded a $10.6 bad debt expense related to the Aluminum divestiture note write-down that occurred when we learned in 2009 that the Aluminum
operation divested in July 2008 needed a capital infusion from the buyer due to deterioration in business conditions. This led to a reduction in the value of the note we accepted as partial payment for the divestiture.



I—Supplemental Balance Sheet Information

Sundry assets, accrued expenses, other current liabilities
and other long-term liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following:

J—Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt, weighted average interest rates and due dates at December 31 are as follows:



Capitalized leases consist primarily of machinery, vehicle and office equipment leases.

Short Term Borrowings

We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 of commercial paper
through a program backed by our $600 credit agreement with a syndicate of 14 lenders that terminates April 30, 2012. Based on the information currently available to us, we believe the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet
their obligations under the agreement. The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250. When we issue these letters of credit, our capacity under the agreement and, consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper is reduced
by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:

Under the syndicated agreement, depending on the prior notice period, we may elect to borrow based on the greater of:

The agent bank’s primary lending rate, or the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus


/


of 1%;

•

The rate published in Moneyline Telerate (for the available currency and interest period chosen for the loan by the company) plus a fixed spread
percentage;

•

A competitive variable or set rate, or

•

For short-term administrative convenience, the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus


/


of 1%.

The revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term
debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit:

•

The amount of total indebtedness to 60% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit agreement);

•

The amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and

•

The amount of assets sold, transferred or disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 20% of total consolidated assets.

We remained well within the
compliance guidelines for all such covenants during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:



K—Lease Obligations

We lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets. Lease terms, including
purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs, vary by lease.

L—Stock-Based Compensation

We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below. One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for
accounting and earnings per share purposes. Shares are issued from treasury for our stock plans’ activity.

Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan. At December 31, 2010, the following shares were
authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:



The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on the results of
operations (including discontinued operations) for each of the years ended December 31:

When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a “windfall” tax benefit is created. The windfall
benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital. When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to
the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax “shortfall” is created. To the extent we have accumulated tax “windfalls” the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed
capital. Net windfall is presented below:

(1) Stock Option Grants

We have granted stock options in several areas as follows:

•

On a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees

•

In conjunction with our Deferred Compensation Program

•

As compensation of outside directors

Options granted to a broad group of employees on a discretionary basis

We grant stock options annually on a discretionary basis to
a broad group of employees. Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months, 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant. Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett’s
closing stock price on the grant date.

Grant date
fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and will be amortized by the straight-line method over the options’ total vesting period except for employees who terminate due to



retirement. A “retirement” termination occurs if the employee is age 65, or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination. For retirement terminations, options continue to vest
and remain exercisable for 3 years and 6 months after termination of employment. Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.

Officers and directors receive stock option awards. Other
employees participate in option choice programs.

In connection with the January 2010 grant, we gave most participants the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in
lieu of options. The value of the cash alternative (paid in the first quarter) was equal to approximately one-half of the Black Scholes value of the option grant the employee would have otherwise received.

In January 2011, we offered two different option choice
programs. One group of employees was offered the same option/cash choice as in 2010, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone. Another group of employees, generally
higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of four options foregone for every one offered. The stock units vest in one-third increments at 12 months, 24 months and 36 months after
the date of grant.

Deferred Compensation Program

We offer a Deferred Compensation Program
under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:

•

Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned. The number of options
granted equals the deferred compensation times five, divided by the stock’s market price on the date of grant. The option has a 10-year term. It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after
the grant date. Stock is issued when the option is exercised.

•

Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to
the market price of our common stock on the acquisition date and they vest immediately. Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned. Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock. These dividends are
used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount. Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant’s pre-set election. Beginning in 2010, stock units may be settled in cash at the discretion of the
Company. Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.

•

Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.

STOCK OPTIONS SUMMARY

Stock option information for the plans discussed above
(including discontinued operations) for the periods presented is as follows:

*

Primarily outside directors’ options

**

Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program. During 2010, 236,905 options were exercised
at a below market exercise price, and 464,088 of these options remain outstanding at December 31, 2010. In 2005, we amended the Program to provide only “at market” stock options

Additional information related to stock option activity for
the periods presented is as follows:

The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option. The expected life of the option (estimated
average period of time the



option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees. Expected
volatility is based on historical volatility measured daily for a time period equal to the option’s expected life, ending on the day of grant. The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.

(2) Stock-Based Retirement Plans

We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified
Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees. We make matching contributions to both plans. In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will
make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee’s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels as defined in the SBP and the ESUP are obtained.

•

Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment
alternatives at market prices. We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions. Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service. Dividends earned
on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant’s election.

•

Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions. Contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date. Stock units are converted to common
stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program. Beginning in 2010, units from the ESUP may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company. The ESUP offered no diversification opportunity for contributions through December 31,
2010.

Beginning April 1,
2011, participant contributions will be credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant and we will make premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant’s
contribution. A participant’s diversified investment account balance will be adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant. Participants may change
investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units in these accounts. The diversified investment accounts will consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and will be
settled in cash. Company matching contributions will be in the form of stock units.

Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements. Distributions under both plans are triggered
by an employee’s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.

Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows:

Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.



(3) Performance Stock Unit Awards

We also grant Performance Stock Unit (PSU) awards in the first quarter of each year to selected officers and
other key managers. These awards contain the following conditions:

•

A service requirement—Awards generally “cliff” vest three years following the grant date; and

•

A market condition—Awards are based on our Total Shareholder Return [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price] as
compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies. The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S&P 500 and S&P Midcap 400 (approximately 320 companies). Participants will
earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3-year performance period.

Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo
simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies and are based upon assumptions similar to those used for stock options. Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three-year
vesting period.

Beginning with the 2010 award
that will be settled in 2013, thirty-five percent (35%) of the award will be paid out in cash. This portion is recorded as a $1.1 liability on the December 31, 2010 balance sheet and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. We
intend to pay out the remaining sixty-five percent (65%) in shares of our common stock, although we reserve the right to pay up to one hundred percent (100%) in cash.

Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant
date fair value of PSU’s for the periods presented:

(4) Restricted Stock Unit Awards

RSU awards are generally granted as follows:

•

On a discretionary basis to selected managers

•

To selected executive officers in connection with employment agreements

•

As compensation for outside directors, who have a choice to receive RSU’s or restricted stock

The value of these awards is determined by the stock price
on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period. As discussed above, beginning in 2011 selected employees can elect to receive RSU’s in lieu of option awards.

day of each month. Shares are purchased and issued on the last business day of each month and generally cannot be sold or transferred for one year.



M—Employee Benefit Plans

The accompanying balance sheets reflect an asset or liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension
plans. Our most significant plans are in the U.S. and represent 88% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.

A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:

Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below:

Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.

We use the average of the Citigroup Pension
Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points). The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using
yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments. The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans’ projected
benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio. The table below presents the discount rate used for the benefit obligation for our most significant pension plans. The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign,
plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.

The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan’s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan’s investment holdings as discussed below.

Pension Plan Assets

The fair value of our major categories of pension plan
assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield
curves, credit risk, etc.).

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:

Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities. The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:

Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind. We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to
the devaluation of any single investment. In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability



to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered. Approximately 60% of our significant plans (the “frozen” plans) are employing a Liability
Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% bonds and 40% equities. The remaining significant plans (the “active” plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% bonds, as historical equity returns have tended to
exceed bond returns over the long term.

Assets of
our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to six different investments: four mutual funds and two separate accounts.

The mutual funds, all passively managed low-cost index funds, include:

•

Total Stock Market Index: Large, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles; using index sampling.

•

FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world; using index
sampling.

•

Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market; index sampling.

•

Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market; using index sampling.

The separate accounts are invested as follows:

•

Small cap U.S. equities: Portfolio of small capitalization U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2000 Value Index.

•

U.S. equities: Broad portfolio of U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index.

Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

We expect to contribute $8.7 to our defined benefit pension
plans in 2011.

Estimated benefit payments,
expected over the next ten years are as follows:

Other Benefit Plans

Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:

Contributions to union sponsored, defined benefit, multiemployer pension plans were less than $.1 in continuing operations and less than $.6 in discontinued operations for each of the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Historically, we have had limited participation in multiemployer



plans, and our participation has continued to decrease in recent years. We do not believe there is a material withdrawal liability associated with these plans.

N—Income Taxes

The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:

Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:

Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:

In 2010, 2009, and 2008 the tax rate benefitted from income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, and the favorable impact of foreign tax credits.



In 2009, tax law changes in Mexico caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and
liabilities in that jurisdiction. As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6.0 tax charge to earnings related to current and prior year tax losses that may expire before they can be utilized.

During 2008, we realized a $7.8 tax benefit associated with
the write-off of an acquired Company’s stock, which had a favorable impact on the tax rate.

We recognized net excess tax benefits (costs) of approximately $0.1, $1.4, and ($.3) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options, which have been recorded to
additional contributed capital as discussed in Note L.

We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so. In the U.S. and many of the state jurisdictions, and in many foreign countries where we file tax returns, a statute of limitations
period exists. After a statute period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period. In addition, we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.

The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at
December 31, 2010, is $42.6, of which $25.7 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 is as follows:

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.

As of December 31, 2010, four tax years were
subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2007 through 2010. Amended federal returns have also been filed for 2006, 2005, and 2004, with refunds of $5.9, $4.3 and $2.5 expected, respectively. In 2010,
IRS examinations of the 2004 and 2005 amended returns were completed, and tentative agreement was reached with the IRS. Consequently, we adjusted our reserve for uncertain tax positions with respect to the largest issue in connection with these
examinations, related to research and development credit claims, which had a favorable impact on our tax provision of $3.6. Additionally, in 2010 we were notified that our 2008 federal tax return would be examined. The audit has commenced, but to
date we are not aware of any material adjustments. Five tax years were undergoing (or subject to) audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2005 through 2009. Examinations are in progress for each of these years and are at various
stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments. Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination as well, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated
financial statements.

We are not aware of any
changes that would materially impact our tax expense for an increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.



Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial
reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. The major temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:

The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain. Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during
recent years, and limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, were factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.

These loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, but no significant amounts expire in
any one year.

Deferred income taxes and
withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends. The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by
available foreign tax credits.

Deferred income
taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2010, which are indefinitely reinvested, are approximately $180.9. If such
earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental taxes would be approximately $41.4 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change. In 2010, we repatriated $108 million of foreign earnings, resulting in a net tax charge of $4.7
million.

Deferred tax assets and (liabilities)
included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:



O—Other (Income) Expense

The components of other (income) expense from continuing operations were as follows:

P—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The following table sets forth the changes in each component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):

Q—Fair Value

We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of
non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets for potential impairment as discussed in Notes B and C.

The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of
financial assets and liabilities are cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivatives hedging financial risks primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.

Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Short-term
investments in this category are valued using discounted cash



flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider
various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources. The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the
end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the
marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following tables present assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.



R—Acquisitions

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition during
the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years’ acquisitions:

During 2010 we also increased our ownership portion to 100% in an automotive business that was previously not wholly owned for $8.6, of which $7.6 represented net cash consideration.

See the table below for acquisitions during the periods
presented. We are finalizing all the information required to complete purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.

The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of
acquisition. The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2010 and 2009 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented, are not materially different from the amounts reflected
in the accompanying financial statements.

The
terms of certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid if the acquired company’s performance exceeds certain targeted levels. Such additional consideration may be paid in cash, and is estimated and
recorded at the acquisition date as additional purchase price. At December 31, 2010, there is no substantial remaining consideration payable.



S—Derivative Financial Instruments

Risk Management Strategy & Objectives

We are subject to market and financial risks
related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge
accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most
significant derivative financial instruments. The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.



Cash Flow Hedges

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had outstanding derivative financial instruments that hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows. The effective changes in fair value of unexpired
contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges

The commodity cash flow hedges manage natural gas commodity
price risk. All commodity hedges at December 31, 2010 had maturities of less than three years. We routinely hedge commodity price risk up to 36 months.

Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges

The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies. The foreign currency cash flow
hedges outstanding at December 31, 2010 had maturity dates within one year. In general, foreign currency cash flow hedges have maturities within two years.

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

In anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest swaps in 2010. The swap contracts
manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 of planned debt issuance in August 2012. The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% and hedge the benchmark rate of an expected issuance of $200 of debt. The credit spread over
the benchmark bonds will continue to fluctuate until the time of issuance.

Fair Value Hedges

Our fair value hedges manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries’ inter-company assets and liabilities. Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in
earnings and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled. These fair value hedges generally have a maturity date within one year.



Net Investment Hedges

We had no net investment hedge activity in 2010 or 2009. In September 2008, we liquidated a $30.0 net
investment hedge of a Swiss subsidiary. The liquidation had a cash cost of $4.4, which is presented as an investing cash flow in our Statement of Cash Flows.

Hedge Effectiveness

We have deemed all ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness. If a hedge was
not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated condensed statements of operations.

Derivatives Not Qualifying for Hedge Accounting Treatment

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had
one derivative transaction that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on this transaction are recorded directly to income and expense in the period impacted, and offset the majority of gains and losses on the underlying
Euro inter-company debt.

The following table sets
forth the pre-tax gains (losses) from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented. This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly
to income or expense.

T—Contingencies

The Company is a defendant in various proceedings involving employment, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
When it is probable, in management’s judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial
statements and make charges against earnings. For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings, and the total liabilities recorded are not material to our financial position.



NPI Lawsuit

On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc. (“NPI”) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC (“Gamber”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements. NPI and Gamber compete in the market
for vehicle computer mounting systems. NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its alleged lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber’s profits in an
unspecified amount.

Although part of the claims
were dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 in disgorgement damages against Gamber. On August 16, the Court: (a) reduced
the jury verdict to approximately $0.5; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict. The Court subsequently
awarded NPI $2.0 in attorney’s fees and costs.

We believe that Gamber has valid bases upon which the appellate court could overturn the verdict and the award of attorney fees and costs.
We intend to vigorously pursue an appeal. NPI has also filed an appeal. We established an accrual for this suit in an amount we believe is probable. Also, we believe that it is probable that at least part of the verdict, attorney’s fees
and costs will be covered by insurance, but that coverage is subject to the insurance company’s reservation of rights.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper
County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284. The suit is substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009. The prior suit was dismissed without prejudice based on its failure to make
demand on the Company’s Board and shareholders. As before, the plaintiff has not made such demand.

The new suit was purportedly brought on the Company’s behalf, naming it as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former
officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell,
Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.

The
plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating the company’s stock plans; caused or allowed the Company to issue false and
misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold Company stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were
unjustly enriched.

The plaintiff is seeking,
among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain Company corporate governance proposals; the
imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants’ stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs. The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from
the Company. The Company has director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.

The Company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late October, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make
demand on the Company’s Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the court’s ruling in the prior suit, this failure to make demand should not be excused; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder;
the suit is based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and



Company stock prices that the Company believes is flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the
statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant. As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under the Company’s Deferred
Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date. The hearing
on the motions to dismiss is scheduled for March 15, 2011.

The Company expects that the outcome of this suit will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Antitrust Lawsuits

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was
initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that competitors of the Company’s carpet underlay division and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. To date, over 40
cases have been filed on behalf of purchasers of polyurethane foam products against over 20 defendants. The Company has been named as a defendant in six cases; five of which have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MD-02196. The first case in which the Company was named as a party: Martin Furniture & Bedding, Inc. v. FXI-Foamex Innovations, Inc., et
al., Case No. 5:10-cv-00178 (Western District of North Carolina) was instituted on November 15, 2010, and is also expected to be transferred.

In the suits to which the Company is a party, the plaintiffs, on behalf of the class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of
unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products during the period 1979 to the present in one case, and from at least 2001 to the present in the other five cases. Each plaintiff
also seeks attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations. We expect the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in the consolidated case on or before
February 28, 2011.

The Company denies all of
the allegations and will vigorously defend itself. This contingency is subject to many uncertainties. Therefore, based on the information available to date, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any. At this
time, we do not believe that it is probable that the outcome will have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.



Quarterly Summary of Earnings

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated

(Unaudited)

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

*

Earnings in the first two quarters of 2009 were significantly impacted as we consumed the majority of higher cost steel but recognized only about half of the offsetting LIFO
benefit (consistent with our historical practice of recording annual LIFO impacts evenly throughout the year). The remainder of the LIFO benefit was recognized in the last half of 2009, a period during which we experienced only minimal impact from
higher cost steel.
