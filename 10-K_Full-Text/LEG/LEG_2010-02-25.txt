PART I

Item 1. Business.

Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company,
a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores and automobiles. As
discussed below, our operations are organized into 19 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing & Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products. We
have also classified certain businesses as discontinued operations.

Overview of Our Segments

Residential
Furnishings Segment

Our Residential Furnishings
segment began with an 1885 patent of the steel coil bedspring. Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a
single source for many of their component needs.

Long production runs, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves. In addition to cost
savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.



PART I

Products manufactured or distributed by our Residential Furnishings groups include:

Bedding Group

•

Innersprings (sets of steel coils, bound together, that form the core of a mattress)

•

Wire forms for mattress foundations

Furniture Group

•

Steel mechanisms and hardware (enabling furniture to recline, tilt, swivel, rock and elevate) for reclining chairs and sleeper sofas

•

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs, sofas and loveseats

silt fencing)

Customers

Most of our Residential Furnishings customers are manufacturers
of finished bedding products (mattresses and foundations) or upholstered furniture for residential use. We also sell many products, including ornamental beds, bed frames, adjustable beds, carpet underlay, and top-of-bed accessories, directly to
retailers and distributors. We sell geo components products primarily to dealers, contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies.

Strategic Direction

In November 2007 we outlined significant changes to the Company’s strategy. We adopted a new primary financial metric, Total Shareholder
Return,

(TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends Received) / Beginning Stock Price)

, changed the priorities for use of cash, adopted role-based portfolio management and implemented more rigorous strategic planning. Our goals over several
years, in sequential order, have been and continue to be to: i) divest low performing businesses, ii) return more cash to investors, iii) improve margins and returns on remaining assets, and iv) then begin to carefully and conservatively grow the
Company (at 4-5% of annual revenue).



PART I

We spent 2008 concentrating primarily on the divestitures, which are largely completed. In 2009 we focused on, and improved, margins; that
focus will continue in 2010. Disciplined growth will be a priority in future years. Consistent with our new objectives, we’ve significantly increased dividends and repurchased our stock.

Strategic Objective

TSR is now the primary financial metric we are using to gauge
success of our strategy. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, which we believe, in the long term, will require average TSR of 12-15% per year. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2009, our TSR performance
places us within the top 4% of the S&P 500.

Consistent with this change, we modified some of our incentive plans to emphasize the importance of TSR. Beginning in January 2008, we introduced a new performance incentive for senior executives based solely on 3-year TSR relative to
peers.

We now employ four key levers to improve
TSR: i) profitable revenue growth, ii) margin improvement, iii) dividends, and iv) stock repurchases. Historically, we focused primarily on the revenue growth lever. We expect that a more balanced approach will generate consistently higher TSR.

More Cash to Shareholders

In 2007 we announced our intent to: i) generate more cash by
improving returns, divesting some assets, and more diligently managing working capital, ii) reduce the amount of cash used for acquisitions and capital spending, and iii) return more cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock
repurchases.

We generated $1 billion of cash flow
from operations in 2008 and 2009 (combined), and we raised over $420 million (after tax) from divestiture proceeds. Furthermore, as anticipated, since 2007 we’ve reduced combined annual spending for acquisitions and capital expenditures by over
50% (to about $86 million in 2009).

As a result,
we were able to raise quarterly dividends, from $.18 (3Q 2007) to $.26 currently. We’ve also spent nearly $500 million to repurchase about 27 million shares during 2008 and 2009, which reduced outstanding shares by approximately 12%.

Narrower Focus

After significant study, in late 2007 we decided to narrow our
focus and eliminate approximately 20% of our revenue base. During 2008 we divested 5 of the 7 targeted business units, including the entire Aluminum Products segment. A sixth unit was sold during 2009, and we expect to divest the seventh in 2010.

In late 2008 we concluded that the Store Fixtures
business unit, as then structured, was not capable of meeting our return requirements. Accordingly, we narrowed the scope of the Store Fixtures unit to concentrate primarily on the metals part of its industry, in alignment with our core
competencies. We also eliminated production facilities, effected



PART I

changes to senior management, reduced overhead, and purged accounts with unacceptable margins. This smaller, more focused business unit is now a “Core” business (as described below).

For information on asset impairments and
restructuring costs associated with our strategic direction see the discussion of “Asset Impairments and Restructuring-related Charges” in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations on page 37, and Note C on page 85 and Note D on page 89 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Portfolio Management

We now manage our business units as a portfolio, with different roles (Grow, Core, Fix, Divest) for each business unit based upon competitive
advantages, strategic position, and financial health. During 2008 we implemented a rigorous strategic planning process, in part to continually assess each business unit’s portfolio role. Historically, we managed all businesses fairly uniformly,
with each awarded capital and expected to grow significantly; that is no longer the case. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth in competitively advantaged positions. Core business units are expected to
enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. Business units in the Fix category will be given a limited time in which to significantly improve performance (with some latitude given
them due to the weak economy). Finally, a few small business units (and portions of business units) are considered non-strategic, and will likely be divested as the M&A market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices.

Improving Returns and Margins on our Asset Base

To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to
consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of the Company’s cost of capital. Each business unit has opportunity to improve, and may employ a variety of means to achieve higher returns including trimming expenses, introducing new
products, improving productivity, adopting more disciplined pricing, reducing working capital, and consolidating assets. Business units that fail to consistently maintain minimum return goals will move to the Fix or Divest categories.

During 2009 significant effort went into improving margins,
despite economy-driven reductions in sales. EBIT margin for 2008 was 5.7% on $4.1 billion of sales while EBIT margin for 2009 was 7.5% on sales of $3.1 billion. Gross margin for 2008 and 2009 was 17.0% and 20.6%, respectively.

Disciplined Growth

For the near-term we expect to focus on better managing the
current asset base and improving returns. That pursuit will require much of senior management’s attention, and during this period revenue growth is likely to be minimal. Over the longer term, the Company expects to focus its growth efforts on a
narrower set of higher quality opportunities, with a target of 4-5% annual revenue growth. Growth capital will be predominantly earmarked for the Grow business units, which are expected to expand at



PART I

rates in excess of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Core business units, for the most part, are operating in markets that grow more slowly than GDP, and are expected to at least maintain
market share. Longer term growth is expected to incorporate product innovation and opportunities to enter new, higher growth businesses that meet strict criteria.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Historically, our typical acquisition targets have been small, private, profitable, entrepreneurial companies that manufacture goods either
within our existing product lines or “one step away” from those product lines and complementary to our existing businesses. As part of our change in strategic direction, we expect fewer and more strategic acquisitions to be completed. All
acquisitions should create value by enhancing TSR; they should have clear strategic rationale and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets.

2009 and 2008 Acquisitions

We had no significant acquisitions in 2009 or 2008.

2007 Acquisitions

We acquired three businesses during 2007 with annualized sales of approximately $100 million broken down by segment as follows:

Commercial Fixturing & Components

$

20 million

Industrial Materials

$

50 million

Specialized Products

$

30 million

In Commercial Fixturing & Components we added one business located in China that produces office chair controls. We also added one
business to the Industrial Materials segment, which produces coated wire products, including racks for dishwashers. Finally, in the Specialized Products segment, we added a business which is a designer and assembler of docking stations that secure
computer and other electronic equipment inside vehicles.

For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 114 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2009 Divestitures

We divested the Coated Fabrics business unit (previously in the Residential Furnishings segment) in the third quarter of 2009. No significant
gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit. Coated Fabrics is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2009 revenue of approximately $12 million. An additional business unit, Storage Products, is targeted for divestiture. Although
market conditions have delayed the timing of this disposition, we are fully committed to selling this business.



PART I

2008 Divestitures

We divested five significant businesses in 2008 with annualized sales of approximately $780 million. The largest divestiture (approximately
$485 million in annualized revenue) was the Aluminum Products segment which was sold in July 2008. We also sold four other business units in 2008 – Wood Products and Fibers (previously in the Residential Furnishings segment); Plastics
(previously in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment); and the dealer portion of Commercial Vehicle Products (previously in the Specialized Products segment). We received after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $408 million for the
five divested businesses, not including subordinated notes and preferred stock. All of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations.

2007 Divestitures

In the first quarter of 2007, we divested our Prime Foam Products business unit (previously in the Residential Furnishings segment) and
received after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $70 million. Our former Prime Foam Products business unit had annual revenue of approximately $190 million and has been classified as a discontinued operation.

For further information about divestitures and discontinued
operations, see Note B on page 83 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Financial Information

For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, earnings before interest and taxes, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 93 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Operations

The percentages of our external sales from continuing operations
related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.



PART I

Our international continuing operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico. The products we make in these countries
primarily consist of:

Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe demand for components is growing. Also, in instances where
our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.

Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

•

Nationalization of private enterprises

•

Political instability in certain countries

•

Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights

•

Credit risks

•

Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates

•

Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war

•

Foreign currency fluctuation



PART I

Our Specialized Products segment, which derives 74% of its trade sales from foreign operations is particularly subject to the above risks.
These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.

Geographic Areas of Operation

We have production, warehousing and distribution facilities in countries around the world. Below is a list of countries where we have
facilities associated with continuing operations:

For further information concerning our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States,
refer to Note F on page 93 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

Sales by Product Line

The following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales from continuing operations by classes of similar products for the last
three years:

Distribution of Products

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own sales personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives
and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Raw Materials

The products we manufacture in continuing operations require a variety of raw materials. Among the most
important are:

•

Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, coil, sheet and angle iron

•

Foam scrap

•

Woven and non-woven fabrics

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we
then use to manufacture:

•

Innersprings and foundations for mattresses

•

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas

•

Displays, shelving and racks for retailers

•

Automotive seating components

We supply the majority of our steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S.
requirements for steel wire. We also produce welded steel tubing both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers. In addition, we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials we use.

We have experienced volatility in raw material prices over the
past few years, most notably in steel. Steel costs increased significantly in 2008 and we implemented price



PART I

increases to recover these higher costs. Market prices for steel began to decrease in late 2008, but with the precipitous drop in demand late in the year and our inability to cancel or return
higher priced earlier purchases, we entered 2009 with high steel costs in inventory. As steel costs decreased in 2009, we implemented selective price reductions; however at current commodity cost levels, we have enhanced our margins.

The future pricing of raw materials is uncertain. The degree to
which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs, should they occur, could influence our future earnings. Also, if raw material costs decrease there may be downward pressure on selling prices, temporarily resulting in lower segment margins as
we consume higher cost inventories.

Higher raw
material costs in recent years have led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods. In some cases, higher cost components have been replaced with lower cost
components, causing us to shift production accordingly. This has primarily impacted profit margins in our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials segments. We are responding by developing new products (including new types of innersprings
and box springs) that enable our customers to reduce their total costs, and in certain instances, provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.

Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2009, no customer accounted for more than 6%
of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 21% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole,
or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing & Components and Specialized Products segments.



PART I

Patents and Trademarks

The chart below shows the approximate numbers of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by
our continuing operations at the end of 2009. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our continuing operations. Most of our patents and trademarks relate to products sold in the Specialized Products
and Residential Furnishings segments.

Some of our most significant

Research and Development

We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our
other facilities. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of
research and development associated with continuing operations ranged from $20 to $30 million per year in each of the last three years.



PART I

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 18,500 employees associated with our continuing operations, of which roughly 13,200 were
engaged in production. Of the 18,500, approximately 8,200 are international employees. Labor unions represent roughly 12% of our employees associated with continuing operations. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract
negotiations with labor unions during 2009. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2010.

The chart below shows the approximate number of employees
associated with continuing operations by segment.

As of December 31, 2008, we had
approximately 20,600 employees associated with continuing operations.

Employees in Discontinued Operations

At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 300 employees associated with discontinued operations, all of which are in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
approximately 490 and 6,550 employees, respectively, associated with its discontinued operations.

Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing
companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our



PART I

products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business
primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.

We believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in North America, in terms of revenue, of the following:

•

Components for residential furniture and bedding

•

Carpet underlay

•

Components for office furniture

•

Drawn steel wire

•

Automotive seat support and lumbar systems

•

Adjustable beds

•

Bedding industry machinery for wire forming, sewing and quilting

We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components
and finished products from Asia. In instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas, we believe our operations should be located nearby to supply them efficiently. Accordingly, at the end of 2009, Leggett operated
10 facilities in China.

In recent years we
experienced increased competition in the U.S. from foreign bedding component manufacturers. We reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs. The
increased price competition for bedding components was partially due to lower wire costs in China. Asian manufacturers benefit from cost advantages for commodities such as steel and chemicals. Foreign manufacturers also benefit from lenient
regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters. In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam. We saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the
antidumping investigations began. As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved. The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009. The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from
these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect for at least another four years. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain
innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and misclassifying the actual country of origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of steel wire products with active antidumping and
antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing
duty orders.

Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced
significant seasonality. The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses. Nevertheless, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters
typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.



PART I

Our four segments tend to experience seasonality as follows:

•

Residential Furnishings

: typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during those periods.

•

Commercial Fixturing & Components

: generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the first and fourth quarters normally lower. This aligns with the retail industry’s normal
construction cycle—the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.

•

Industrial Materials

: minimal variation in sales throughout the year.

•

Specialized Products

: relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model
changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.

Backlog

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and
projected demand based on customer relationships.

Working Capital Items

For further information regarding working
capital items, see the discussion of “Cash from Operations” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 50.

Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and
regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management
expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation to
address climate change that is intended to reduce overall green house gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. Similar initiatives are being pursued at the state level as well. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a
determination that green house gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment. It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or
regulation. However, if enacted, this type of program could materially increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation and electricity. In that event, our intent would be to raise prices in order to cover the cost
increases.

Internet Access to Information

We routinely post information for investors to our website
(www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form



PART I

10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or
furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for its Audit,
Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors can be found on our website. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Discontinued Operations

As a result of our new strategic direction adopted at the end of
2007, several of our businesses are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our
ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale; and (iii) we do not, or will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses after the disposal
transactions. The discontinued operations include:

•

Aluminum Products segment

. We divested
this segment in July 2008. It produced and sold non-automotive aluminum, zinc and magnesium die castings, and new and refurbished dies (also known as molds or tools) for all types and sizes of die casting machines. It also provided machining,
coating, finishing, sub-assembly and other value-added services for die cast components. These products and services were sold to (i) small engine and diesel engine builders; (ii) motorcycle, off-road and recreational vehicle, truck and
automobile makers; (iii) manufacturers of outdoor lighting fixtures, cable line amplifiers, wireless communications systems, and other cable and telecommunication products; (iv) consumer appliance and power tool manufacturers;
(v) producers of electric motors, computers and electronics; (vi) gas barbeque grill manufacturers; and (vii) die cast manufacturers.

•

Prime Foam Products unit, Wood Products unit, Fibers unit and the Coated Fabrics unit (each
previously reported in the Residential Furnishings segment).

(i)

We divested the Prime Foam Products unit in the first quarter of 2007. It primarily produced commodity foam used for cushioning by bedding and upholstered furniture
manufacturers.

(ii)

We divested the Wood Products unit in the third quarter of 2008. It sold wood frames and cut-to-size dimension lumber to bedding manufacturers.

(iii)

We divested the Fibers unit in the fourth quarter of 2008. It sold fiber cushioning material primarily to bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers.

(iv)

We divested the Coated Fabrics unit in the third quarter of 2009. It sold non-slip rug underlay and shelf liners primarily to retailers and distributors.

•

Plastics unit and the Storage Products unit (each previously reported in the Commercial
Fixturing & Components segment)

.

(i)

The Plastics unit, which was divested in the third quarter of 2008, sold injection molded plastic components primarily for manufacturers of lawn care equipment and
power tools.



PART I

(ii)

The Storage Products unit sells storage racks and carts used in the food service and healthcare industries. This divestiture has not yet been completed.

•

An automotive seating components operation and the dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products
unit (each previously reported in the Specialized Products segment)

.

(i)

The automotive seating components operation, which we divested in the first quarter of 2008, sold welded assemblies, and wire and tubular frames for automotive seating.

(ii)

We divested the dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit in the third quarter of 2008. It sold truck bodies for cargo vans, flatbed trucks, service trucks
and dump trucks primarily to end-users of light-to-medium duty commercial trucks.

For further information on discontinued operations, see Note B on page 83 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and
elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time
by other reports we file with the SEC.

We have exposure to economic and
other factors that affect market demand for our products.

As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns. Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and
products. Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence. To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing
turnover, energy costs and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts
approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand
weakness in the majority of our markets in 2009 led to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses. Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, and low consumer confidence contributed to conservative
spending habits by consumers around the world. Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends; however, we currently expect market demand to stabilize at these lower levels. If economic and market conditions
remain depressed or deteriorate further, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.



PART I

Deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

We serve customers in a variety of industries, some of which
are experiencing unprecedented decreases in demand that began in late 2008 and have continued through 2009, due to the weak global economy. While we currently expect markets to stabilize, a sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that
one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could adversely impact our sales, net earnings, financial condition, cash flow and liquidity.

Costs of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results.

Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost
increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs move with the market. When we experience significant increases in raw
material costs, we attempt to implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Also, raw material cost decreases generally allow us to
pass through reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings.

Steel is our most significant raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been extremely volatile in recent years.
This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year. Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of foam scrap. We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of this commodity in recent years.

Higher raw material costs in recent years led
some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods. In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components. This has primarily impacted our
Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins. This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.

We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.

Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet
is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. Continued economic uncertainty could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.

Asian competition could adversely affect our operating results.

We operate in markets that are highly
competitive. We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well. We face ongoing pressure
from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a



PART I

portion of their components and finished products from Asia. If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to
maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed.

Our goodwill
and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment.

A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2009,
goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $1.1 billion, or approximately 36% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment, sundry assets and non-current assets held for sale totaled approximately $748
million, or approximately 24% of total assets.

We
review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the
recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and
economic conditions, as well as future expectations. The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2009 indicated no goodwill impairments. Goodwill associated with reporting units whose fair values exceeded the carrying value by 10-20% was
$373.4 million; $112.3 million of goodwill was associated with reporting units that had 20-30% excess fair value; and $442.5 million of goodwill was associated with reporting units that had fair values in excess of the carrying values by greater
than 30%. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment in discontinued operations of $3.0 million for our Storage Products Unit because the carrying value of the assets held for sale exceeded fair value less costs to sell. Fair
value and the resulting impairment charge were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers.

For the year ended 2009, other long-lived asset impairments were $2.8 million, substantially all of which were in continuing operations, for
fixed assets to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell.

If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset calculations, we could incur future (unanticipated) impairment charges, which could negatively impact
our results of operations.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk.

We expect that international sales will continue
to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2009, 25% of our sales from continuing operations were generated by international operations. The revenues and expenses of our
foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Further, our
competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our
future operations and financial results.



PART I

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Carthage, Missouri. At December 31, 2009, we had 238 production, warehouse,
sales and administrative facilities associated with continuing operations, of which 174 were disbursed across the United States and 64 were located in foreign countries.

Properties by Location and Segment in Continuing Operations

Properties by Use and Segment in Continuing Operations


Includes some multi-purpose facilities with additional warehouse, sales and/or administrative uses.

Facilities that we own produced approximately 70% of our sales
from continuing operations in 2009. We also lease many of our production, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs). For additional information regarding lease
obligations, see Note K on page 99 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

In the opinion of management the Company’s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and
distribution of our products. Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base. Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels. We face
decisions about further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that eventually market demand will improve. With our currently low utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate that demand
improvement when it occurs.

At December 31,
2009 we had eight production or warehouse facilities classified as discontinued operations, of which seven were in the United States and one was in Mexico.

PART II

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

2009 HIGHLIGHTS

As we entered 2009, we were facing some of the most challenging market conditions that we’ve experienced
in decades and we recognized that there was little we could do to influence that reality. Therefore, our focus remained on several key activities that we could control, including aggressive cost containment, headcount reduction, facility
consolidation, maintaining strict discipline on pricing, and optimizing working capital levels. As a result of our efforts in these areas, we exited 2009 with significantly improved EBIT margins (despite much lower sales), and for the year, we
generated the second highest level of operating cash flow in our history.

Our global markets stabilized in 2009, albeit at very low demand levels. For the full year, sales decreased 25% due primarily to weak market demand, but also to a combination of steel-related price
deflation and our decision to exit specific customer programs with unacceptable profit margins.

We strive to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require average TSR of
12-15% per year. For the period beginning January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009, our 32% TSR ranks within the top 4% of the S&P 500.

Reflecting confidence in our strategic progress, margin improvement, strong cash generation, and the stability we believe has developed in
our markets, in August 2009, we increased our quarterly dividend modestly to $.26 per share. We also utilized essentially all the Board’s authorization enabling us to repurchase 10 million shares of our stock in 2009, with the majority of
the purchases occurring during the last half of the year.

Our financial profile remains strong. We ended 2009 with net debt to net capital well below our long-term targeted range, no significant fixed-term debt maturing until 2013, and nearly $500 million available under our existing commercial
paper program and revolver facility.

These topics
are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.



PART II

INTRODUCTION

What We Do

Leggett & Platt is a diversified manufacturer, and member of the S&P 500 index, that conceives, designs, and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in most homes, offices, and automobiles, and many
retail stores. We make components that are often hidden within, but integral to, our customers’ products.

We are North America’s leading independent manufacturer of: components for residential furniture and bedding, carpet underlay,
components for office furniture, drawn steel wire, automotive seat support and lumbar systems, and bedding industry machinery.

Our Segments

Our continuing operations are composed of 19 business units in four segments, with approximately 19,000 employees, and more than 140
production facilities located in 18 countries around the world. Our segments are described below.

Residential Furnishings

This segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by
bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. We also sell carpet cushion, adjustable beds, bed frames, ornamental beds, and geo components.

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Operations in this segment manufacture and sell store fixtures and point-of-purchase displays used in retail
stores. We also produce chair controls, bases, and other components for office furniture manufacturers.



PART II

Industrial Materials

These operations primarily supply steel rod, drawn steel wire, steel billets, and welded steel tubing to other Leggett operations and to
external customers. Our wire and tubing is used to make bedding, furniture, automotive seats, wire retail fixtures, mechanical springs, and many other end products.

Specialized Products

From this segment we supply lumbar systems and wire components used by automotive seating manufacturers. We manufacture and install the
racks, shelving and cabinets used to outfit fleets of service vans. We also produce machinery, both for ourselves and for others, including bedding manufacturers.

Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

During the past two years, we have divested six businesses. In 2008, we sold our Aluminum Products segment and four smaller business units
(Wood Products, Fibers, Plastics, and the dealer portion of Commercial Vehicle Products). In 2009, we sold the Coated Fabrics business unit. We received after-tax cash proceeds of $420 million for these six businesses, exceeding our original
estimate of approximately $400 million. One additional business unit (Storage Products) is also targeted for divestiture. Results of operations for all of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements.

For the remaining divestiture, we expect to
recover the carrying value of the net assets held for sale. Net assets classified as held for sale totaled $40 million at December 31, 2009 (this includes $22 million not associated with the Storage Products business). Although recent market
conditions have delayed the timing of the final disposition, we are fully committed to selling this business.

Strategic Direction

In late 2007, we outlined significant changes to the Company’s strategy. We adopted a new primary financial metric (Total Shareholder Return), adopted role-based portfolio management, implemented
more rigorous strategic planning, and changed the priorities for use of cash. Our goals, in sequential order, were to i) divest low performing businesses, ii) return more cash to investors, iii) improve margins and returns, and iv) begin to
carefully and conservatively grow the company at 4-5% of annual revenue. We have made significant progress over the past two years.

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is the key financial measure that we use to monitor performance. TSR is driven by the change in our share
price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price]. We focus on four key sources of TSR: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases. Historically, our primary objective was
profitable growth. Going forward, we intend to generate higher TSR through a balanced approach that employs all four sources of TSR. In 2008, dividends and stock buybacks largely drove our TSR; during 2009, we benefited significantly from margin
improvement; and within a few years we expect that modest



PART II

annual sales growth will also contribute to TSR. Beginning in 2008, we introduced TSR-based incentives for senior executives and modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to
achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2009, our TSR performance places us within the top 4% of the S&P 500 companies.

We narrowed our focus and eliminated (during 2008 and 2009)
approximately 15% of our portfolio through the divestiture of the Aluminum Products segment and five additional business units (one divestiture remains). We also narrowed the scope of the Store Fixtures unit to focus primarily on the metals part of
the fixtures industry, in alignment with Leggett’s core competency of producing steel and steel-related products. These activities were largely complete by the end of 2008, and resulted in charges that impacted our operating results (primarily
in 2007 and 2008). Those charges are discussed on page 37 under the section titled “Asset Impairments and Restructuring-related Charges.”

We have implemented a more rigorous strategic planning process to assess our business units and help guide future decisions regarding
business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest). This review includes criteria
such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as EBITDA growth, operating cash flows, and return on assets. To remain in the portfolio, business
units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.

The majority of our business units are categorized as
“Core”. A much smaller percentage are categorized as “Grow”; consequently, we recognize as a strategic imperative the need to expand the Grow category by improving i) our success rate at developing innovative new products and ii)
our abilities to identify new growth platforms. A few small business units are considered “Fix”, and must improve their performance within a reasonable time frame (with some latitude given them due to the weak economy). Finally, a few
small business units (and portions of business units) are considered non-strategic, and will likely be divested as the M&A market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices.

The strategic changes have increased available cash. We expect to continue returning much of this cash to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Customers

We serve a broad suite of customers, with no
single one representing over 6% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.



PART II

Major Factors That Impact Our Business

Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and
competition.

Market Demand

Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several
economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates. All these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and
therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand weakness in the majority of our markets during 2009 led
to lower unit orders, utilization levels, sales and earnings. Several factors, including weak global economies, a depressed housing market, and low consumer confidence contributed to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world. Short
lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into future demand trends; however, we currently expect demand to stabilize at these lower levels. Given our balance sheet strength, operating cash flow and access to credit, we expect
to be able to endure an extended downturn in market demand with no material impact to our financial position or liquidity.

Activities completed over the past few years (including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain
underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins, and other cost reduction initiatives) improved our cost position in advance of the late 2008 economic contraction, and we continued to tightly constrain
spending in 2009. We face decisions about further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that eventually market demand will improve. With our currently low utilization levels, we should be able to readily
accommodate that demand improvement when it occurs.

Raw Material Costs

In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost
advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials. This purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have. Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are
commodities) fluctuate.

Purchasing arrangements
vary across the company. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. In certain of our businesses, we have longer-term purchase contracts with pricing terms that
provide stability under reasonable market conditions. However, when commodities experience extreme inflation, vendors do not always honor those contracts.

Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material
costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is a critical
factor; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.



PART II

Steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity. In
most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers via selling price adjustments. Steel costs increased significantly in 2008 and we implemented price increases to recover these higher costs. Market prices
for steel began to decrease in late 2008, but with the precipitous drop in demand late in the year and our inability to cancel or return higher priced earlier purchases, we entered 2009 with high-cost steel in inventory. As steel costs decreased in
2009, we implemented selective price reductions; however at the lower commodity cost levels, we enhanced our margins.

As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market
price for steel rod). The increase in scrap costs in late 2009 and early 2010 has resulted in currently lower metal margins in the steel market and in our rod producing operation. While pricing trends in the steel market are difficult to predict, we
expect the lower metal margins to continue in 2010.

Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and typically pass them through to our customers.

When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs,
this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We experienced this de-contenting effect in our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials segments in recent years.
As our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address steel and chemical inflation, our profit margins were negatively impacted. We are responding by developing new products (including new types of mattress
innersprings and boxsprings) that enable our customers to reduce their total costs, and in certain instances, provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.

Competition

Many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be
smaller, private companies.

We believe we gain
competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations, significant internal production of key raw materials, manufacturing expertise and product innovation, higher quality products, extensive customer service capabilities, and
financial strength. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering product quality, innovation, and customer
service.

We continue to face pressure from
foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia. In instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas, our operations must be located nearby to supply
them efficiently. We currently operate 10 facilities in China.

In recent years we experienced increased competition in the U.S. from foreign bedding component manufacturers. We reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices,



PART II

and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs. The increased price competition for bedding components was partially due to lower wire costs in China.
Certain foreign manufacturers also benefit from more lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters. In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam. We saw a
distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began. As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved. The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009.
The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect for at least another four years. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold
at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and misclassifying the actual country of origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of
steel wire products with active antidumping and antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement
of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.

Asset
Impairments and Restructuring-related Charges

Net impairment and restructuring-related charges (for both continuing and discontinued operations) totaled $405 million over the last three years ($16 million in 2009, $84 million in 2008, and $305 million in 2007). The majority of these
charges, or $344 million, occurred as a result of the 2007 Strategic Plan announced in late 2007 ($154 million in continuing operations and $190 million in discontinued operations); we believe this activity to be substantially complete. For further
information about asset impairments and restructuring, see Notes C and D to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 85 and 89.

For information regarding the methodology and assumptions we use for impairment testing, refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
on page 55, and also Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 85.



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2009 vs. 2008

During 2009, sales from continuing operations decreased 25%, reflecting a combination of weak market demand, steel-related price deflation,
and our decision to exit some specific sales with unacceptable margins. In the majority of our global markets, demand stabilized at low levels in early 2009.

Despite the significant sales decline, full-year earnings from continuing operations decreased only modestly, from $128 million in 2008 to
$121 million in 2009. Cost structure improvements and pricing discipline offset nearly all the impact from lower sales.

Further details about our consolidated and segment results from continuing operations are discussed below. To comply with FASB guidance for
presentation of noncontrolling interest (discussed on page 82), earnings for 2008 have been retrospectively adjusted to include the portion of earnings from our joint ventures that are attributable to the minority investors.

Consolidated Results (continuing operations)

The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from
continuing operations during 2009, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.



PART II

Sales from continuing operations decreased 25% versus 2008, reflecting weak market demand, inflation-related price decreases, and our
decision to exit specific customer programs with unacceptable profit margins (the largest portion in our Store Fixtures business).

Full-year earnings from continuing operations also decreased in 2009. The earnings impact from lower unit volume was largely offset by cost
reduction initiatives and pricing discipline. Other factors impacting the year-over-year earnings comparison are presented in the table above. The divestiture note write-down (identified in the table) occurred when we learned in 2009 that the
aluminum operations divested in July 2008 needed a capital infusion from the buyer due to deterioration in business conditions. This led to a reduction in the value of the note we accepted in 2008 as partial payment for the divesture. Leggett has
accepted a more subordinate position in the capital structure of the divested operations.

LIFO Impact

All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. We experienced a large swing in the LIFO impact during the past two years. In 2008, significant steel cost inflation along with moderately higher
inventory levels resulted in LIFO expense from continuing operations of $62 million. In 2009, steel cost decreases and lower inventory levels resulted in a LIFO benefit from continuing operations of $67 million. Segment-level earnings in 2008
generally benefited under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs, but in the first half of 2009, were significantly burdened as we consumed higher cost steel (both in inventory and committed under purchase agreements) while
selling prices decreased.

The LIFO impact
recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each year by FIFO impacts at the segment level; however, we experienced significant variability in our quarterly earnings in 2009 as these items were recognized. Earnings in the first two
quarters of 2009 were significantly impacted as we consumed the majority of the higher cost steel but recognized only about half of the offsetting LIFO benefit (consistent with our historical practice of recording annual LIFO impacts evenly
throughout the year). The remainder of the LIFO benefit was recognized in the last half of 2009, a period during which we experienced only minimal impact from higher cost steel.

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 78.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense decreased $8 million versus 2008, primarily
the result of lower commercial paper borrowings and lower interest rates in 2009.

The consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for 2009 was higher, at 39.0%, versus 33.8% in 2008. This increase is primarily due to i) tax adjustments resulting from



PART II

Mexican tax law changes, and ii) the lower level of earnings and mix among tax jurisdictions. In 2009, tax law changes in Mexico caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities
in that jurisdiction. As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6 million tax charge to earnings related to current and prior year losses that may expire before they can be utilized to reduce taxable earnings. In 2008, a tax benefit associated
with the write-off of an acquired company’s stock was offset by increased reserves for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for certain foreign entities.

Segment Results (continuing operations)

In the following section we discuss 2009 sales and earnings
before interest and taxes (EBIT) from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 93.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales decreased in 2009, reflecting weak market demand and steel-related price deflation. Demand in our residential markets was weak throughout 2009 as consumers world-wide continued to defer purchases of large
ticket items (such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture) that contain our products.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2008, with the earnings impact from significantly lower unit volumes partially offset by cost reductions, pricing discipline, elimination of poorly performing
operations, and the absence of 2008’s restructuring-related and other costs ($18 million).

Commercial Fixturing & Components



PART II

Sales decreased in 2009 due to our decision in the Store Fixtures business to exit specific customer programs with unacceptable margins,
reduced capital spending by retailers, and market softness in Office Furniture Components.

EBIT and EBIT margins also decreased versus the prior year, as the impact from lower sales more than offset benefits from cost reductions, prior elimination of poorly performing facilities, and other
operating improvements, as well as the absence of 2008’s restructuring-related costs ($11 million).

Industrial Materials

2009 sales decreased, reflecting weak demand in many of our markets (including bedding, furniture, and automotive) and steel-related price deflation.

EBIT and EBIT margins also decreased versus 2008, as lower sales more than offset cost reductions.

Specialized Products

Sales decreased in 2009, reflecting weak global demand in our markets.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus the prior year, as the impact from lower sales more than offset benefits from cost reduction initiatives and other operating improvements, as well as the absence of
2008’s restructuring-related costs ($5 million).

Results from
Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings
from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $13 million, from a loss of $19 million in 2008 to a loss of $6 million in 2009. This earnings increase was primarily due to lower asset impairments and restructuring-related charges, partially
offset by $3 million (net of tax) of environmental charges related to an aluminum property.



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2008 vs. 2007

During 2008, sales from continuing operations decreased 4%. We reported full-year net earnings from continuing operations of $128 million,
which included $21 million of restructuring-related charges, impairments, and other items. Our 2008 earnings reflected soft market demand which led to lower unit volume in many of our businesses. In the majority of our markets, demand was soft
throughout the year, but weakened appreciably late in the third quarter as consumers further reduced their spending in response to the financial market distress and general U.S. and global economic conditions. Market share gains in certain
businesses offset some of the impact from weak demand.

During the year, we also experienced significant inflation in steel costs, and we successfully implemented price increases to recover the majority of these higher costs. Further details about our consolidated and segment results from
continuing operations are discussed below. To comply with FASB guidance for presentation of noncontrolling interest (discussed on page 82), earnings have been retrospectively adjusted to include the portion of earnings from our joint ventures that
are attributable to the minority investors.

Consolidated Results
(continuing operations)

The following table
shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2008, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.



PART II

Sales from continuing operations decreased 4% versus 2007, primarily reflecting weak market demand and our decision to exit specific sales
volume with unacceptable profit margins (primarily in our Store Fixtures business). These declines were partially offset by inflation-related price increases and market share gains.

Our U.S. bedding components business gained market share in 2008 as a result of: i) bedding manufacturers
shifting innerspring purchases from international to domestic sources; ii) the deverticalization of a strong regional bedding manufacturer (they now buy components from us that they previously produced for themselves); and, iii) increased demand for
innerspring mattresses, rather than premium-priced, non-innerspring products.

We experienced significant inflation in steel costs during 2008, and in response, we implemented price increases to recover the higher costs. The magnitude of our selling price increases varied by product
line depending on steel content, but in our major Residential and Industrial businesses, prices increased substantially. By late 2008, steel costs began to decrease.

Full-year earnings from continuing operations were higher than in 2007, primarily due to:

•

Non-recurrence of 2007 goodwill impairment charges related to our Fixture & Display group ($120 million)

•

Non-recurrence of 2007 tax items ($12 million)—adjustments to valuation allowances related to potential foreign tax benefits

•

Lower interest expense

Several factors negatively impacted earnings. The most significant were:

•

Unit volume declines (down roughly 10% for the year)

•

Higher restructuring-related charges and asset impairments ($19 million)

•

Reduced production levels—with the significant pull-back in demand late in the year, we cut production (even below depressed demand levels) and
reduced inventories

LIFO Impact

All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method
for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic,
steel-related inventories. Significant steel cost increases during the year, along with moderately higher levels of these steel-related inventories, resulted in LIFO expense from continuing operations of $62 million in 2008 (versus a $1 million
benefit in 2007). Segment-level earnings in 2008 generally benefited under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs. For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 78.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense decreased $9 million versus 2007, primarily
the result of debt maturities paid in 2007 and 2008, as well as lower commercial paper borrowings.



PART II

The consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for 2008 was also lower, at 33.8% versus 55.9% in 2007. The 2007 rate was negatively
impacted by goodwill impairment charges totaling $143 million, of which $95 million were non-deductible. This caused the 2007 rate as a percent of pre-tax income to be much higher than normal. In 2008, a tax benefit associated with the write-off of
an acquired company’s stock was offset by increased reserves for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for certain foreign entities.

In the third quarter of 2008, we recorded a $4 million valuation allowance against certain foreign tax assets.
The valuation allowance related to our Canadian automotive operations that produce lumbar supports. In late 2008, the automotive industry was in a dramatic state of decline, which reduced the demand for our components. In addition to demand factors,
these operations were also negatively impacted by the strength in recent years of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar (our Canadian automotive operations sell in U.S. dollars while incurring labor and overhead costs in Canadian dollars,
thereby reducing margins). As a result, we believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets associated with these operations. We provide a discussion regarding the recoverability of the Automotive
unit’s long-lived assets under Critical Accounting Policies on page 56.

Segment Results (continuing operations)

In the following section we discuss 2008 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from continuing operations for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to
consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 94.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales decreased in 2008, reflecting weak market demand. This decrease was partially offset by inflation-related price increases and market share gains in our U.S. bedding business (discussed under Consolidated
Results above).

Demand in our U.S. residential
markets was weak throughout 2008, but softened further in late September reflecting reduced spending by consumers on large ticket items that contain our products. International markets, which were relatively stronger earlier in the year, also
experienced much softer demand in the latter part of the year as a result of deteriorating global economic conditions.



PART II

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2007 due to lower sales and higher asset impairments and restructuring-related costs (of $14
million), partially offset by a gain from the sale of a business (of $8 million) and operating improvements in certain locations.

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Sales decreased in 2008 due to several factors, including our decision in the Store Fixtures business to exit specific sales volume with unacceptable margins, reduced capital spending by retailers, and lower demand for office furniture
components.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased
versus the prior year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of 2007’s goodwill impairment charge (of $143 million), partially offset by lower sales.

Industrial Materials

2008 sales increased significantly, primarily from the pass through of higher steel costs and increased sales of steel billets. Ongoing weak demand in many of our markets (including bedding, furniture, and automotive) offset a portion of
the sales gain.

EBIT and EBIT margins also
increased versus 2007, primarily due to higher sales and operating improvements in certain locations.

Specialized Products



PART II

Sales decreased in 2008, primarily reflecting weak demand that continued throughout the year in our North American automotive business and
the fleet portion of Commercial Vehicle Products. Our machinery and European and Asian automotive businesses posted full-year sales growth despite demand softening late in the year.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus the prior year, mainly due to lower sales, higher restructuring-related
costs (of $4 million), and higher steel costs with limited recovery.

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $52 million, from a loss of $71 million in 2007 to a loss of $19 million in 2008. This earnings increase was primarily due to lower asset impairments and
restructuring-related charges (of $90 million), partially offset by the non-recurrence of a 2007 tax benefit (of $30 million) associated with a difference in book and tax basis of stock held in the Aluminum segment as a result of that business
reaching held for sale status.



PART II

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION

In this section, we provide details, reflecting both continuing and discontinued operations, about our:

•

Uses of cash

•

Cash from operations

•

Debt position and total capitalization

We use cash for the following:

•

Finance capital requirements (e.g. productivity, growth and acquisitions)

•

Pay dividends

•

Repurchase our stock

Our operations provide much of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs. In 2008, cash proceeds from
completed divestitures were an additional significant source of funds. In 2009, we generated our second highest level of cash from operations in our history, at $565 million. With less benefit from working capital reductions expected in 2010,
operating cash should approximate $300 million, readily exceeding our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends. We ended 2009 with net debt to net capital of 23.7%, below our long-term target and year-end 2008 levels. Our long-term
target is to have net debt as a percent of net capital in the 30%-40% range. Page 53 presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years.

Uses of Cash

Finance Capital Requirements

Improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be a key focus. However, cash is available to fund selective growth, both
internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).



PART II

Capital expenditures include investments we make to modernize, maintain, and expand manufacturing capacity. With our move to role-based
portfolio management, we are more restrictive in funding capital projects. Capital spending in 2010 is expected to be less than $90 million. Growth capital, which had historically been available to all our businesses, is now predominantly earmarked
for our Grow business units. Operations designated as Core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements, but expansion capital is limited.

We have also set a higher bar for acquisitions, and plan to pursue disciplined growth through fewer, but more
strategic, opportunities. We will seek acquisitions within our growth businesses, and will also look for longer-term opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets that meet strict criteria.

As a result of the new acquisition criteria, no significant
acquisitions were completed in 2008 or 2009. In 2007, we acquired three businesses that were expected to add about $100 million to annual revenue ($20 million in Commercial Fixturing & Components, $50 million in Industrial Materials, and
$30 million in Specialized Products). These businesses:

•

established a foothold in Asian production of office chair controls

•

manufactured coated wire products, including racks for dishwashers, and presented Leggett with expanded technologies and cross-segment selling
opportunities

•

broadened our suite of products for commercial vehicle interiors

In addition to the initial cash outlays for acquisitions (shown in the accompanying chart), we also assumed
debt of $24 million in 2007. We provide additional details about acquisitions in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.

Pay Dividends

With continued improvement in
margins and returns, a decrease in capital spending and acquisitions, and the completion of most of the divestitures, we expect (and have recently had) more available cash to return to shareholders. Higher annual dividends are one means by which
that will occur. In late 2007, we raised our quarterly dividend by 39%,



PART II

to $.25 per share. In 2009 we modestly increased the quarterly dividend further, to $.26 per share, and extended to 38 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average
compound growth rate of 14%. Our targeted dividend payout is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, but has been higher recently and will likely remain above targeted levels in the near term. Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high
priority. We expect to spend approximately $155 million on dividends in 2010 (slightly less than in 2009 because of share repurchases). Cash from operations has been, and is expected to continue to be, sufficient to readily fund both capital
expenditures and dividends.

Repurchase Stock

Share repurchases are the other
means by which we return cash to shareholders. During the past three years, we repurchased a total of 38 million shares of our stock and reduced outstanding shares by about 16%. In 2009, we repurchased approximately 6% of shares outstanding at
an average per-share price of $18.21. We expect to repurchase additional shares in 2010, with the amount of purchases dependent on factors such as general economic conditions, level of demand in our end markets, and the availability of excess cash.
Although no specific repurchase schedule has been established, we have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2010.



PART II

Cash from Operations

Cash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally
have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.

In 2009, cash from operations
increased $129 million versus 2008 primarily as a result of improving working capital trends.

•

Accounts receivable—While the dollar amount of accounts receivable has decreased primarily due to weak sales, our days of sales outstanding has
increased as customers have slowed payments during the continued economic downturn. We continue to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts are paid on time.

•

Inventory—Specific actions to reduce raw material purchases and production levels, along with price deflation, have resulted in a lower dollar
amount of inventory. However, the number of days of inventory on hand increased versus the prior year due to weak sales.

•

Accounts Payable—We continue efforts to optimize payment terms with our vendors and as a result have seen an increase in both dollars of accounts
payable and number of days of payables outstanding.

Cash from operations in 2008, though strong, was $178 million lower than in 2007 primarily due to a smaller year-over-year decrease in working capital. Extremely weak market demand in the latter part of
2008 negatively impacted earnings. Working capital decreased in 2008 as a result of lower inventory and accounts receivable levels. Fourth quarter production cuts led to lower inventory levels (versus the prior year). Accounts receivable also
declined primarily due to extremely weak sales late in the year.



PART II

The following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years.

(1)

The accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net
accounts receivable ÷ (net sales ÷ number of days in the year).

(2)

The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory
÷ (cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the year).

(3)

The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending
accounts payable ÷ (cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the year).

Working capital levels vary by segment. The Commercial Fixturing & Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts
receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the Fixture & Display group. This business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products,
longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.



PART II

Capitalization

This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.

(1)

These calculations include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the
averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.

(2)

Equity decreased $480 million in 2008, primarily reflecting net share repurchases of $234
million, dividends of $165 million, and currency impacts of $146 million.

(3)

Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in
operating leases. Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.

The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2009 and 2008, calculated in two ways:

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.

We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows
a more meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.



PART II

Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) decreased $74 million in 2009. During the year, we reduced our commercial paper borrowings by $52 million and paid off $22 million of
other long-term debt that came due.

We can raise
cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 14 lenders that terminates in 2012. Based on the information currently available to us, we
believe that the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement. At December 31, 2009, $25 million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program and is classified as long-term debt. We
also maintain an active shelf registration. With anticipated operating cash flows, the commercial paper program and the active shelf registration, we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations, pay dividends,
repurchase stock, and fund future growth.

Our
commercial paper program continued to operate efficiently during the disruption of the global credit markets in late 2008; those markets stabilized during 2009. Changes in the credit markets and other events of the past year did not materially
impact our weighted average effective borrowing rate for commercial paper. If a disruption in the credit market was to become so severe that we were unable to issue commercial paper, we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on our
revolving credit agreement. In such event, the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowing.

The revolving credit agreement provides for the ability to issue letters of credit up to an aggregate $250
million. Any utilization of these commitments for letters of credit reduces our commercial paper/loan capacity by a corresponding amount. At December 31, 2009, we had issued $84 million of letters of credit under these commitments. Accordingly,
at year end, an additional $491 million was available to us under our commercial paper program ($600 million in total program - $25 million of outstanding commercial paper - $84 million of issued letters of credit).



PART II

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments:

*

The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due. Long-term debt
includes $25 million of outstanding commercial paper, which is generally due overnight. We have classified commercial paper as long-term debt (due in 1-3 years) since the commercial paper program is supported by a $600 million revolving credit
agreement which terminates in 2012.

**

Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.

***

Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 at rates in effect at the end of the year. These totals include interest on the $25
million of outstanding commercial paper discussed above.



PART II

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes
could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.

“Critical accounting estimates” are those that are:
a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.

We provide additional details regarding our significant
accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 78.

Contingencies

Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the likelihood that
the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost. Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.

On July 22, 2004, we were named as one of approximately 80
defendants in several cases consolidated as Gray v. Derderian, Case No. 1:04-CV-312-L, U.S.D.C. R.I. This litigation resulted from a nightclub fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island involving multiple deaths and injuries. There are in excess of 550
plaintiffs in the litigation. Along with other foam manufacturing defendants, Leggett is alleged to have manufactured and sold bulk polyurethane foam to a foam fabricator in Rhode Island, who in turn, is alleged to have fabricated and sold foam
sheets to the nightclub. The foam was among other materials alleged to have caught fire when pyrotechnics were ignited inside the nightclub.

We believe we did not manufacture the foam subject to the lawsuit and that we have valid defenses to the claims. Nevertheless, with our
consent, our primary insurance carrier reached a tentative settlement with counsel for all plaintiffs on April 29, 2008 and we executed the final settlement agreement on October 6, 2009. The settlement agreement is subject to various
court approvals and the signature of all plaintiffs. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we would pay a $2 million self-insured retention. The remainder of the $18.2 million settlement would be paid by our insurance carrier. We do not believe the
settlement or the outcome will have a material effect on Leggett’s financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations. We recorded $2 million of expense in 2008 and currently have a $16.2 million receivable from the insurance
carrier and an $18.2 million liability related to this matter, that is included in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

We adopted new accounting guidance in 2009 as discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 82. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

(Unaudited)

(Dollar amounts in millions)

Interest Rates

The table below provides information about the Company’s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. Substantially all of
the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was less than its carrying value by $71.1 at December 31, 2009, and less than its carrying value by $107.1 at December 31, 2008.
The increase in the fair market value of the Company’s debt is primarily due to the decrease in credit spreads over risk-free rates as compared to the prior year end. The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary
market rate, as of December 31, 2009 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated “spread” over such Treasury securities representing the Company’s interest costs under its medium-term note program. The fair value of
variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.

*

Includes $25 and $77 of commercial paper in 2009 and 2008, respectively, supported by a $600 revolving credit agreement which terminates in 2012.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to
interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks. The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that
qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is the Company’s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments. Information regarding cash flow hedges, fair value
hedges and net investment hedges is provided in Note S on page 115 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.



PART II

Investment in Foreign Subsidiaries

The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long-term commitment, and does not hedge translation exposures. The investment
in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes. The Company’s net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to translation exposure) in foreign subsidiaries, including those held for sale, at
December 31 is as follows:

Effectiveness of the Company’s Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation as of December 31, 2009
was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective, as of December 31, 2009, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the
time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

PART IV

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
Leggett & Platt;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of Leggett & Platt are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Leggett & Platt; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett & Platt
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management (including ourselves), we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial
reporting, as of December 31, 2009, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 72 of this Form 10-K.



PART IV

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leggett & Platt,
Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are



PART IV

being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007

A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“we” or “our”). To facilitate timely financial reporting, many subsidiaries outside of the
United States are consolidated as of and for a fiscal year ended November 30. Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial
statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of
daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not
bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses determined from individual account reviews by management. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the
receivable will not be recovered.

INVENTORIES:
All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity. The cost for approximately 60% of our inventories is determined by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap. For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs. For these inventories, the FIFO cost at December 31, 2009 and 2008 approximated expected replacement cost.

Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow moving and potentially obsolete items using actual
inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value. Reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory not held for sale on a FIFO basis were $42.1 and $38.0, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
for a net increase of $4.1.

PLANNED DIVESTITURES:
Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:

Discontinued Operations

—A business is classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the
business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing
involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions. Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are
met.



If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the
date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement. Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations. Gains and
losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.

Assets Held for Sale

—An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management
commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan
will be withdrawn. In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control. Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed. Evaluating the
recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized. The assets and related liabilities are
aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.

Assets Held for Use

—If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use. Assets of the business are evaluated
for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill. In evaluating the recoverability of property and
intangible assets subject to amortization, in a held for use business, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition. If the carrying value exceeds the
undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. There are inherent judgments and estimates used in determining future cash flows and it is
possible that additional impairment charges may occur in future periods. In addition, the sale of assets can result in the recognition of a gain or loss that differs from that anticipated prior to the closing date.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal. Depreciable lives primarily range from 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment with a weighted
average life of 9 years; 10 to 40 years for buildings with a weighted average life of 28 years; and 3 to 15 years for other items with a weighted average life of 7 years. Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.

Property is tested for recoverability at year end and whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.

GOODWILL: Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as
triggering events may occur. We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year. Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying value. Reporting units are business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.

If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and
involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to the excess.

In evaluating the
recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the business groups. In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for
similar entities using price to earnings ratios. Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, internal sales growth, margins, capital expenditure



requirements, and working capital requirements. Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment. There are inherent assumptions and judgments
required in the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Substantially all other intangible
assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 40 years with a weighted average of 15 years and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the
recoverability of property, plant and equipment.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using
the straight line method over the vesting period of the award.

SALES RECOGNITION: We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination. The timing of
our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination. We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers nor is it our practice to
replace goods damaged or lost in transit. Sales allowances and discounts can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of “Cost of
goods sold.” Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in “Net sales.”

RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation
costs related to exit activities. Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities. We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal
activity when the liability is incurred. Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.

INCOME TAXES: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting
for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or
payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as
appropriate. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized. A provision is also made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested. This provision would be substantially offset by available foreign tax credits.

The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management’s estimate of
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the
liabilities are no longer necessary. Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute
engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F. Operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Europe, Asia, Canada, Latin America, Australia and South Africa.



We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and
generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged. We maintain allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have generally been within management’s expectations.

We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product
warranties which require disclosure.

From time to
time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt. To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet
certain requirements are used. We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.

The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.

OTHER RISKS: Although we obtain insurance for
workers’ compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles. Accrued liabilities include estimates for
both unpaid, reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported. Provisions for losses are recorded based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our
third-party administrators and insurance carriers.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge
accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge
relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction. The process includes the linking of the derivative instruments
that are designated as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are
highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Derivatives are recorded in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in “Other current” or “Sundry” assets or “Other current” or “Other long-term” liabilities.

On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging
instruments and account for it as follows:

Cash Flow Hedge—

The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge. The effective portion of the change
in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated
Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is reported in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.

Fair Value Hedge—

The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge. For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective
portions of the changes



in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations on the same line as the hedged item.

Net Investment Hedge—

The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is designated as a net investment hedge. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives, based upon spot rates, used as a net
investment hedge of a foreign operation is recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a net investment hedge is
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect
at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates. The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain reclassifications have been made to
the prior years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2009 presentation:

•

In the Consolidated Balance Sheets—noncontrolling interests have been reclassified from “Other long-term liabilities” to
“Noncontrolling interest” within “Equity.”

•

In the Consolidated Statements of Operations—noncontrolling interests have been reclassified from “Other expense (income), net” to
“(Earnings) attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax.”

•

In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows—noncontrolling interests have been reclassified between “Net earnings” and “Other
adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities” and to reflect separate presentation of “Provision for losses on accounts and notes receivables.”

•

In the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity—balance sheet activity as well as comprehensive income information has been added for
noncontrolling interest.

•

In Notes F, G, I and O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information, EBIT for Commercial Fixturing & Components and
Specialized Products has been retrospectively adjusted to include noncontrolling interest.

•

In Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information, long-lived assets by geographic location have been retrospectively
adjusted to include only tangible long-lived assets.

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE: In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance codifying generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) which was effective beginning with
our September 30, 2009 reporting period. While the guidance was not intended to change GAAP, it did change the way we reference these accounting principles in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance for presentation of
noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements, which was effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements, but as required by the guidance,
noncontrolling interest is now presented as a component of equity. Also, net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest is presented separately. Prior year information has been retrospectively adjusted as described above.

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance for
additional disclosure surrounding defined benefit pension plan assets effective for our December 31, 2009 financial statements and is included in Note M.



B—Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale

During 2007 we completed an extensive review of our business
portfolio and determined that we would exit certain of our business activities. This included the divestiture of some operations, the pruning of some business and the closure of certain underperforming plants, referred to as the 2007 Strategic Plan.
Details related to completed divestitures are discussed below.

Third quarter 2009

•

Coated Fabrics unit—No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit, which was previously reported in the Residential
Furnishings segment.

Fourth quarter 2008

•

Fibers unit—The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $8.6 ($7.8 loss net of tax) that is reported within earnings from discontinued
operations. This unit was previously reported in the Residential Furnishings segment.

Third quarter 2008

•

Aluminum Products segment—This segment was sold for $300 in cash, a $25 subordinated promissory note (fair value of $14.1), and shares of
preferred stock (no book value, with face value not to exceed $25, dependent upon future performance of the divested business). The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7.6 ($16.0 gain after taxes) that is reported within earnings
from discontinued operations.

Late in the second quarter of 2009, we learned that this business needed a capital infusion due to deterioration in business conditions and determined that the collectability of the promissory note was not reasonably assured. We recorded a
$10.6 non-cash reduction in the value of the promissory note that is reported in “Other expense (income), net” on the Statements of Operations. On June 30, 2009, we surrendered the promissory note, and in exchange, received $15 face
amount (fair value of $3.5) of redeemable preferred stock. The fair value estimate incorporated various inputs related to the aluminum operations including: historical financial information, assumptions about future revenue, earnings, and cash flows
and earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics. Management believes it was in our best interest to accept the preferred stock in exchange for the promissory note due to the higher likelihood of recovery
resulting from the modification to the buyer’s capital structure.

•

Wood Products unit—The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.1 ($4.4 loss net of tax) that is reported within earnings from
discontinued operations. This unit was previously part of the Residential Furnishings segment.

•

Plastics unit—The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $9.4 ($6.7 loss net of tax) that is reported within earnings from discontinued
operations. This unit was previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment.

•

The dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit—The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of $.4 ($.3 gain after
taxes) that is reported within earnings from discontinued operations. This business was previously reported in the Specialized Products segment.

First quarter 2008

•

One automotive seating components operation—The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2.5 ($1.7 loss net of tax) that is reported
within earnings from discontinued operations. This business was previously part of the Specialized Products segment.

•

One metal store fixture operation—This operation was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2007, but did not meet the requirements for
discontinued operations. The results for this operation (including a pre-tax gain on sale of $1.5) are included in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment. The pre-tax gain is reported in “Other expense (income), net”.



First quarter 2007

•

In 2007 we sold our Prime Foam Products unit which was previously part of the Residential Furnishings segment.

At December 31, 2009 we had one remaining business held for
sale (Storage Products). Pre-tax proceeds (fair value less costs to sell) from Storage Products are expected to recover the carrying value of the assets held for sale as presented in the following tables. Although market conditions have delayed the
timing of this disposition we are fully committed to selling and actively marketing this business. The net assets held for sale may fluctuate due to changes in working capital until this business is divested.

Results from discontinued operations and activity directly
related to these divestitures subsequent to the date of sale for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

(1)

In the first quarter 2008, the Coated Fabrics unit met the criteria for held for sale and discontinued operations. All others met the criteria during 2007.

(2)

In the fourth quarter 2009, pre-tax impairment charges of $3.0 were recorded for the Storage Products unit to reflect an updated estimate of fair value less costs to
sell, as discussed in Note C.



(3)

During 2008 and 2007, goodwill and other impairment charges were recorded to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as discussed in Note C.

(4)

In the fourth quarter 2009 we recorded charges for an environmental issue related to an aluminum property that was sold prior to the divestiture of this business.

Net assets held for sale by segment
at December 31 were as follows:

These tables include $22.2 and $21.9 of property, plant and equipment held for sale at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily associated with the closings of various operations and prior
year restructurings not associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan. These amounts also include land and buildings retained when we divested the Aluminum Products segment.

The major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

C—Impairment Charges

Goodwill

Goodwill is required to be tested for
impairment at least once a year or as triggering events may occur. We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in June of each year as discussed in Note A.



Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a
market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the
use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value. Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after tax cash
flows for each reporting unit. These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.

The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit. The price to earnings
ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years. The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium. Projected earnings are
based upon market analysts’ projections. The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value. Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value
estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.

The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the
timing and risk of future cash flows. Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. Discounted cash flow
projections are based on 10-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital
expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.

2007 Goodwill Impairment Reviews

During the annual review performed in June 2007, it was determined that no impairments were indicated for any of the reporting units because forecasted results indicated that operations would generate
sufficient cash flows to recover their carrying amounts.

Later in the year, as part of the strategic review (discussed in Note B), which was broader in scope, more strategic in nature, and more long-term oriented than any previous reviews, we assessed the structure and financial attractiveness of
our various markets, and our competitive position in those markets. Based upon new facts and perspectives obtained from this review, we reduced the operating margin and growth rate expectations for several of our business units. We determined the
finalization and approval of the activities associated with the strategic plan was considered a triggering event and step one of the impairment test indicated potential goodwill impairment in the Fixture & Display and Aluminum Products
reporting units.

We performed the second step of
the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value
of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

As a result of this process, we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to the Fixture & Display
and Aluminum Products reporting units of $142.6 and $83.3, respectively. The significant assumptions included a 10-year compound annual growth rate of 5% and 4% related to Fixture & Display and Aluminum Products, respectively. Terminal
values for each reporting unit were calculated using a long-term growth rate of 3%. Future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 12% for Fixture & Display and 13% for Aluminum Products.



2008 Goodwill Impairment Reviews

The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2008,
indicated no goodwill impairments.

The
deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the associated revision to earnings as a result of lower demand was considered a triggering event. An interim goodwill impairment analysis was performed in the
fourth quarter 2008 that confirmed fair values exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. Future cash flow assumptions were reduced to reflect lowered sales and production levels for 2009 and 2010, returning to historical levels thereafter.
Other significant assumptions included (i) 10-year compound annual growth rates ranging from 2-6%; (ii) terminal values for each reporting unit using a long-term growth rate of 3%; and (iii) discount rates ranging from 11-12%.

2009 Goodwill Impairment
Review

The annual goodwill
impairment review performed in June 2009, indicated no goodwill impairments. There were no triggering events in 2009 that required an additional goodwill review.

Reporting units’ fair values in relation to their respective carrying values are:

Significant assumptions used in the June 2009 review included (i) 10-year compound annual growth rates ranging from 2-9%; (ii) terminal values for each reporting unit using a long-term growth
rate of 3%; and (iii) discount rates ranging from 10.5-12.0%. If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.

Businesses Held for Sale

In November 2007, we determined that we would exit certain of our business activities, and adopted a new strategic plan which required us to
perform certain impairment reviews in the fourth quarter. As a result of this review, goodwill and asset impairments were recorded in 2007 relating to held-for-sale locations as summarized in the table below.

In 2008, asset impairment charges were recorded as updated
estimates of fair value less costs to sell became more certain. Pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $25.6 were necessary and recorded for the Fibers ($11.0), Coated Fabrics ($4.1), and Storage Products ($10.5) units during the third quarter 2008
as a result of the deterioration in the economy and credit markets and the impact on available credit for potential buyers.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded $3.0 impairment for the remaining goodwill associated with the Storage Products Unit. As a result,
the carrying value of these assets held for sale approximated fair value less costs to sell at December 31, 2009. Fair value and the resulting impairment charge were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers.

Other Long-Lived Assets

As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are tested for
recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.



As a result of the deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter
of 2008, we performed an impairment review and determined that intangible assets associated with supply agreements in Latin America were impaired due to a significant reduction in the expected future cash flows associated with these agreements,
resulting in an impairment of $9.5 in the Residential Furnishings segment.

We also recorded other various impairments as presented in the table below which did not individually result in a material charge to earnings for the periods presented. These impairments are primarily
related to intangibles in 2008 and to property, plant and equipment in 2009 and 2007. Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers for fixed assets and discounted cash flows for intangibles.

The pre-tax impact of impairment charges on
continuing and discontinued operations is summarized in the following table. Asset impairments associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Impairment of goodwill” and “Other expense,
net.” Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.” Of the total impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007, $3.0, $32.3 and $276.7, respectively, were associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan.



D—Restructuring

We have
historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures. These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations. Except for
the “2007 Strategic Plan” described below, none of these initiatives have individually resulted in a material charge to earnings for any of the periods presented. Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended
December 31 were comprised of:



Total restructuring and other special charges associated with discontinued operations are
reported on the Statements of Operations in “Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.”

2007 Strategic Plan

As discussed in Note B, in November 2007, we adopted a strategic plan which included the exit of certain businesses. These exit activities
were substantially complete by the end of 2008.

The following table contains information, by segment, regarding the amount of each major type of restructuring-related cost incurred in connection with the exit activities.

(1)

Restructuring charges associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Other expense, net.” Inventory obsolescence
associated with continuing operations are reported in “Cost of goods sold.”

•

2009 restructuring charges of $1.0 are comprised of $.2 employee termination cost and $.8 of other restructuring costs.

•

2008 restructuring charges of $2.4 are comprised of $1.0 employee termination cost, $.3 of contract termination costs, $1.8 of other restructuring
costs, $1.9 of inventory obsolescence, and ($2.6) of gain on sales of assets.

•

2007 restructuring charges of $4.5 are comprised of $.8 employee termination costs, $2.0 of contract termination costs and $1.7 of inventory
obsolescence.

(2)

Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.”

•

2009 restructuring charges of $.1 are comprised entirely of other restructuring costs.

•

2008 restructuring charges of $17.5 are comprised of $.6 employee termination costs, $.4 of other exit costs, primarily plant closure and asset
relocation, and $16.5 of loss from sale of asset.

•

2007 restructuring charges of $6.2 are comprised of $.1 employee termination costs, $.4 of other exit costs and $5.7 of inventory obsolescence.

(3)

Cash charges totaled $1.1, $4.1 and $3.3 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



The accrued liability associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan consisted of the following:

Other Initiatives

Apart from the
2007 Strategic Plan, we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives over the last three years to improve our operating cost structures. None of these actions has individually resulted in a material charge to earnings. Total costs associated
with these other initiatives have had the following impact on our financial statements:

For the years ended 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, restructuring and other special charges (income) associated with continuing operations by segment were: Residential Furnishings—$2.9, $4.4,
$7.1; Commercial Fixturing & Components—$4.0, $6.9, $(2.3); Industrial Materials—$.1, $.4, $(.6); Specialized Products—$1.5, $5.2, $1.1.

The accrued liability associated with Other Initiatives consisted of the following:



E—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:

In 2009 and 2008, we recorded goodwill impairment charges as outlined in Note C.



Intangible assets purchased during 2009 and 2008 included in “Other intangibles”
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:

Total additions to intangibles above include $0 and $2.0, related to business acquisitions in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset class are as follows:

Estimated amortization expense for continuing operations in each of the next five years is as follows:

F—Segment Information

We have four operating segments that are generally focused on broad end-user markets for our diversified products. Residential Furnishings derives its revenues from components for bedding, furniture and
other furnishings, as well as related consumer products. Commercial Fixturing & Components derives its revenues from retail store fixtures, displays and components for office and institutional furnishings. Industrial Materials derives its
revenues from drawn steel wire, specialty wire products and welded steel tubing sold to trade customers as well as other Leggett segments. Specialized Products derives its revenues from automotive seating components, specialized machinery and
equipment, and commercial vehicle interiors.



Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with
our management organizational structure. Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating decision maker. The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are
regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.

Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool
to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.

The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial
statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory. Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate performance based on earnings
from operations before interest and income taxes (EBIT). Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the
segment. Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales and EBIT. These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related
to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.

A summary of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are shown in the following tables.

To comply with the FASB guidance regarding noncontrolling interest discussed under “New Accounting
Guidance” in Note A, EBIT for 2008 and 2007 have been retrospectively adjusted as follows to include noncontrolling interest: 2008—Commercial Fixturing & Components—(from $13.8 to $14.4); Specialized Products—(from $40.7
to $44.7); 2007—Specialized Products—(from $64.6 to $70.1).



Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for
return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance. These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment. Segment assets for all years are reflected at their
estimated average for the year. Acquired companies’ long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.

Capitalized leases consist primarily of machinery, vehicle and office equipment leases.

We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 in
commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 14 lenders that terminates in 2012. Based on the information currently available to us, we believe that the participating banks continue to
have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement. At December 31, 2009, $25 of commercial paper was outstanding under this program and is classified as long-term debt. The revolving credit agreement also provides for the ability
to issue letters of credit up to an aggregate of $250, of which approximately $84 were issued under the revolver as of December 31, 2009, resulting in $491 available under the commercial paper program at year-end.

Under the syndicated agreement, depending on
the prior notice period, we may elect to borrow based on 1) the greater of (a) the agent bank’s primary lending rate, or (b) the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus


/


of 1% 2) the rate published in Moneyline Telerate (for the
available currency and interest period chosen for the loan by the company) plus a fixed spread percentage, 3) a competitive variable or set rate, or 4) for short-term administrative convenience, the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds
transactions, plus


/


of 1%. This agreement will
terminate on April 30, 2012.

The revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit a) the amount of total indebtedness to 60% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit
agreement), b) the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) the amount of assets sold, transferred or disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 20% of total consolidated assets. We remained well within
the compliance guidelines for all such covenants during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

During the disruption of global credit markets experienced late in 2008 our commercial paper program continued to operate efficiently. Credit
markets stabilized during 2009, however if a disruption in the credit markets was to become so severe that we were unable to issue commercial paper, we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on our revolving credit agreement. In such
event, the cost of borrowing under the credit agreement could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowing.

Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

K—Lease Obligations

We
lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets. Lease terms, including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs, vary by lease.

Total rental expense from continuing operations was $47.5, $56.9
and $63.2 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Future minimum rental commitments for all long-term non-cancelable operating leases included
in continuing operations are as follows:

The above lease obligations expire at various dates through 2017. Aggregate rental commitments above include renewal amounts where it is our intention to renew the lease.

Total rental expense for discontinued operations, which are not
included in the amounts above, was $3.3, $7.7 and $9.7 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The future minimum rental commitments for the discontinued operations are $3.5 in 2010, $2.9 in 2011, $1.9 in 2012, $1.4
in 2013, $1.2 in 2014 and $1.2 in later years.

L—Capital
Stock and Stock-Based Compensation

CAPITAL STOCK

Activity in our stock accounts for each of the three years ended December 31 is as follows:

Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan. At December 31, 2009, a total of 22,835,936 common shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan.
This amount represents 12,574,358 unexercised options; 6,246,697 outstanding stock units; and 4,014,881 shares that remain available for grant (of the outstanding stock units, 4,037,874 are vested and 2,208,823 are unvested).

We issue shares from treasury for stock option exercises and
stock unit conversions, as well as for employee purchases of common stock made through the Discount Stock Plan and Stock Bonus Plan.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below. Awards are provided in the form of common stock, stock options,
stock units, restricted stock, restricted units and performance stock units. One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.



The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on the results of
operations (including discontinued operations) for each of the years ended December 31:

When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a “windfall” tax benefit is created. The windfall
benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital. When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to
the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax “shortfall” is created. To the extent we have accumulated tax “windfalls” the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed
capital. The net shortfall resulting from exercises and conversions for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.1, (including a $1.4 tax benefit discussed in Note N) leaving an accumulated tax windfall of $22.7 in additional contributed
capital.

(1) Stock Option Grants

We grant stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a
broad group of employees. Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months, 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant. Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett’s
closing stock price on the grant date. Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program. In 2005, we amended the Program to provide for “at market” stock options.
During 2009, discretionary and deferred compensation grants totaled 2 million options with an aggregate grant date fair value of $4.4 under the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The estimated grant date fair value of options is amortized by the straight-line method over the options’
total vesting period except for employees who terminate due to retirement. A “retirement” termination occurs if the employee is age 65, or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination. For retirement terminations, options
continue to vest and remain exercisable for 3 years and 6 months after termination of employment. Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.

Beginning with the January 2010 grant we gave employees the
choice to receive options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options. The value of the cash alternative was equal to approximately one-half of the Black Scholes value of the option grant the employee would have otherwise received.



(2) Stock-Based Retirement Plans

We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated
employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees. We make matching contributions to both plans.

•

Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment
alternatives at market prices. We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions. Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service. Dividends earned
on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant’s election.

•

Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions. Contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price. Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio
upon distribution from the program. The ESUP offers no diversification opportunity.

In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee’s contributions for the
year if certain profitability levels as defined in the SBP and the ESUP are obtained.

Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements. Distributions under both plans are triggered
by an employee’s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.

During 2009, employees contributed a total of approximately $7.2 into these plans, including $.8 related to 2008 bonuses paid in 2009. The Company match expensed in 2009 totaled $5.7 and the discount
expense on stock units was $1.7.

(3) Discount Stock Plan

Under the Discount Stock Plan (DSP), a
tax-qualified §423 stock purchase plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of Leggett common stock at 85% of the closing market price on the last business day of each month. Prior to January 2009 shares purchased under the plan were issued
annually and dividends earned prior to issuance were used to purchase additional shares. Starting in January 2009, shares were purchased and issued on the last business day of each month. These shares generally cannot be sold or transferred for one
year. Employees purchased 397,825 shares under the DSP during 2009 at an average purchase price of $13.08 per share, net of the discount. In 2009, the total discount expense related to the DSP was approximately $.9. Since inception of the DSP
in 1982, a total of 21,360,022 shares have been purchased by employees. Eligible employees may purchase a maximum of 23,000,000 shares under the plan.

(4) Deferred Compensation Program

We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or
interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation. Stock options under this program are granted on December 31 of the year immediately prior to the year the compensation is earned. The number of options granted equals the deferred
compensation times five, divided by the stock’s market price on the date of grant. Options vest as the associated compensation is earned and are exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date. Stock is issued when the option is exercised.

Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are
acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock when purchased and they vest immediately. Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned. Stock units earn
dividends at the



same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock. These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount. Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance
with the participant’s pre-set election. Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years. Employees deferred compensation
(including bonuses) of $5.0 into the DSU plan and $.6 into stock options during 2009.

Below is a summary of the number of options and units employees received in exchange for compensation during 2009 and the related grant date fair value:

(5) Performance Stock Unit Awards

Beginning in 2008, we granted Performance Stock Unit (PSU) awards to selected officers and other key managers. The value of these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, and expense is
recognized over the three-year performance period. The grant date fair values of these awards were $15.76 in 2009 and $15.95 in 2008 and are based upon assumptions similar to those used for stock options as discussed on the following page. These
awards contain the following conditions:

•

A service requirement—Awards generally “cliff” vest three years following the grant date; and

•

A market condition—Awards are based on our Total Shareholder Return [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price] as
compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies. The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S&P 900 (approximately 330 companies). Participants will earn from 0% to 175%
of the base award (the base award was total shares of 584,650 in 2009 and 516,525 in 2008) depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3-year performance period.

(6) Restricted Stock Unit Awards

Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) awards are granted on a
discretionary basis to selected managers. The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period. In 2009, we made special RSU grants to three executive officers in
connection with new employment agreements. One fourth of these awards vested when the officer’s contract was signed in 2009 and one fourth vests annually on each of the three remaining anniversary dates.

COMPENSATION COST NOT YET RECOGNIZED

As of December 31, 2009, the unrecognized
cost of non-vested stock options was $3.3. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of one year. The unrecognized cost of stock unit awards was $12.9, to be recognized over a weighted-average period of .9 years.

The following table summarizes the weighted-average per share fair value and related assumptions used to calculate the grant date fair value
of options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life
of the option. The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than
other employees. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility measured daily for a time period equal to the option’s expected life, ending on the day of grant. The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the
time of grant.



STOCK UNITS

A summary of the nonvested stock units outstanding for the plans discussed above at December 31, 2009 and
changes during the twelve months then ended is presented below:

*

PSU awards are at maximum payout

At December 31, 2009, there were 4,037,874 fully vested stock units outstanding with an aggregate intrinsic value of $82.1. The
intrinsic value of nonvested stock units was $45.1 at December 31, 2009. The total intrinsic value of stock units converted to common stock during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $1.1, $1.0 and $2.5, respectively.

M—Employee Benefit Plans

The accompanying balance sheets reflect an asset or liability
for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. On January 1, 2008, we adopted new guidance that required the funded status of our plans to be measured as of year end beginning with the December 31, 2008
balance sheet. We previously used September 30 as the measurement date for our most significant plans. We chose to perform a measurement that covered the 15-month period of October 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. Upon
implementation, a proportionate allocation was made to cover the net benefit income for the transition period and we recorded a $.5 (net of tax) increase to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2008.



A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007 and changes during the years then ended, is as follows:

Those plans that have benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31 are recapped below:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $230.8, $222.2 and $234.6 at December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

Included in the above plans
is a subsidiary’s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan. The subsidiary owns insurance policies with cash surrender values of $2.4, $2.3 and $2.2 at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, for the participants in this
non-qualified plan. These insurance policies are not included in the plan’s assets.



Comprehensive Income

Following are the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax) as of December 31, 2009 and
2008 that had not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost:

Net Pension Income (Expense)

Components of net pension income (expense) for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount
rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points). The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments. The Merrill Lynch Index
rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans’ projected benefit



payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio. The discount rate used for the benefit obligation for our most significant pension plans was 5.75% for 2009, 6.0% for 2008 and
6.0% for 2007. The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.

The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan’s historical experience and our
expectations of future returns based upon each plan’s investment holdings as discussed below.

Pension Plan Assets

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance for additional disclosure surrounding plan assets of defined benefit pension plans effective for the December 31, 2009 financial statements. The fair value
of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield
curves, credit risk, etc.).

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

Presented below are our major categories of investments at December 31, 2009:

Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities. The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:

Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind. We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to
the devaluation of any single investment. In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered. Approximately 60% of our
significant plans (the “frozen” plans) are employing a Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 75% bonds and 25% equities. The remaining significant plans (the “active” plans) have a target allocation
of 75% equities and 25% bonds, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.



Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to
seven different investments: five mutual funds and two separate accounts.

The mutual funds, all passively managed low-cost index funds, include:

•

Total Stock Market Index: Large, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles; using index sampling.

•

Developed Markets Index: International large-cap equity; developed markets in Europe and the Pacific region; full-replication approach.

•

Total Bond Market Index: Broadly diversified exposure to investment-grade U.S. bond market; using index sampling.

•

Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market; index sampling.

•

Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market; using index sampling.

The separate accounts are invested as follows:

•

Small cap U.S. equities: Portfolio of small capitalization U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2000 Value Index.

•

U.S. equities: Broad portfolio of U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index.

Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

We expect to contribute $2.0 to our defined benefit pension
plans in 2010.

Estimated benefit payments,
expected over the next ten years are: 2010—$14.6; 2011—$14.8; 2012—$14.8; 2013—$15.2; 2014—$15.3 and 2015-2019—$81.5.

Other Benefit Plans

Total expense from continuing operations for multiemployer plans and other defined contribution plans was $6.7, $8.5 and $9.8 in 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively.

Contributions to union
sponsored, defined benefit, multiemployer pension plans were less than $.2 in continuing operations and less than $1.0 in discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. These plans are not administered by
us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. While we have no present intention of withdrawing from any of these plans, nor have we been informed that there is any intention to terminate such
plans, we do not believe there would be a material withdrawal liability in such event.

N—Income Taxes

The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:



Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:

Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:

In 2009, tax law changes in Mexico caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction. As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6.0 tax charge to earnings related to
current and prior year tax losses that may expire before they can be utilized.

During 2008, we realized a $7.8 tax benefit associated with the write-off of an acquired company’s stock, which had a favorable impact on the tax rate.

During 2007, $94.7 of the total goodwill impairment charged to
continuing operations was nondeductible, which had an adverse impact on the tax rate.

We recognized net excess tax benefits (costs) of approximately $1.4, ($.3), and $1.4 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options, which have been recorded to
additional contributed capital as discussed in Note L.

We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so. In the U.S. and many of the state jurisdictions, and in many foreign countries where we file tax returns, a statute of limitations period exists. After a statute
period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period. In addition, we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.



The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, is $44.5, of
which $28.2 ($24.9 continuing operations and $3.3 discontinued operations) would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2009, 2008 and
2007 is as follows:

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.

As of December 31, 2009, four tax years were
subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2006 through 2009. Amended federal returns have also been filed for 2005 and 2004 with refunds of $6.0 and $3.0 expected, respectively. These return filings are
also subject to review by the IRS, with the largest issue related to a research and development credit. Additionally, six tax years were undergoing (or subject to) audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2003 through 2008.
Examinations are in progress for each of these years and are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments. Lastly, various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination as
well, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.

We are not aware of any changes that would materially impact our tax expense for the increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits within the next 12 months.

Deferred
income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. The major temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:



The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
for which utilization is uncertain. Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, and limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, were factors considered in determining the valuation allowance. This
includes valuation allowances of approximately $7.3 and $11.2 recorded in 2009 and 2008, respectively, for certain Canadian net operating losses.

Generally, no significant amounts of carryforwards expire in any one year. However, $14.3 of the carryforwards will expire in 2015, if not
used beforehand.

Deferred income taxes and
withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends. The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by
available foreign tax credits.

Deferred income
taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings which management has deemed to be permanently reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2009, which we have deemed to be permanently
reinvested, are approximately $223.2. If such earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental taxes would be approximately $34.9 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.

Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) included in the
consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

O—Other Expense

The components of other expense from continuing operations were as follows:



P—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

The following table sets forth the changes in each component of
accumulated other comprehensive income:

Q—Fair Value

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the FASB guidance for fair value measurements, except as it applies to non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis, for which this guidance was effective January 1, 2009.

The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities that were included in the January 1, 2009 effective date are allocating purchase price to the assets
and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets for potential impairment as discussed in Notes B and C.

The areas in which we utilize fair value measures that were included in the January 1, 2008 adoption are cash equivalents, short-term
investments and derivatives hedging financial risks primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.

The FASB guidance does not require any new fair value measurements, but requires expanded disclosure about fair value measurements and
establishes a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Short-term
investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that
consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources. The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued
as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the
marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.



The following tables present assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on
a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009 and 2008:

As of December 31, 2009:

R—Acquisitions

The
following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions consummated in 2009, 2008 and 2007 and any additional consideration paid for prior years’
acquisitions:



During 2009, we acquired one Industrial Materials business that distributes erosion control
products. The purchase price over fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired was $.4. Adjustments to and additional consideration for prior year acquisitions increased goodwill by $9.8, resulting in a total increase in goodwill of $10.2, of
which $2.6 is expected to provide an income tax benefit. We are finalizing all the information required to complete purchase price allocations related to this acquisition and do not anticipate any material modifications.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and
earnings per share as though the 2009 and 2008 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented, are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

During 2008, we acquired two businesses with purchase price over
the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $.9. Adjustments to and additional consideration for prior year acquisitions increased goodwill by $9.5, resulting in a total increase in goodwill of $10.4, of which $1.4 is expected to
provide an income tax benefit. In Commercial Fixturing & Components, we acquired one business that produces parts for our office furniture components division. In Residential, we acquired machinery and the process technology used to
manufacture carpet underlay.

During 2007, we
acquired three businesses with purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $37.5. Adjustments to and additional consideration for prior year acquisitions increased goodwill by $1.4, resulting in a total increase in
goodwill of $38.9, of which $10.3 is expected to provide an income tax benefit. These acquired businesses manufacture and distribute products primarily for office components, industrial materials and commercial vehicle products.

The results of operations of the above acquired companies have
been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition. The terms of certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid if the acquired company’s performance exceeds certain
targeted levels. Such additional consideration may be paid in cash, and is recorded when earned as additional purchase price. At December 31, 2009, there is no substantial remaining consideration payable.

S—Derivative Financial Instruments

Risk Management Strategy & Objectives

We are subject to market and financial risks
related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge
accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most
significant derivative financial instruments. The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.



As of December 31, 2009:



Cash Flow Hedges

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had outstanding derivative financial instruments that hedge forecasted
transactions and anticipated cash flows. The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted and are
presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges

The commodity cash flow hedges primarily manage natural gas commodity price risk. There were $3.6 and $9.2 in outstanding notional amounts related to commodity hedges at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, all of which had maturities less than three years. We routinely hedge commodity price risk up to 36 months.

Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges

The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies. The foreign currency cash flow hedges
outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008 primarily hedged Canadian dollar exposures and had maturity dates within two years. In general, foreign currency cash flow hedges have maturities within two years.

Fair Value Hedges

Our fair value hedges manage foreign currency risk associated
with subsidiaries’ inter-company assets and liabilities. Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled. These fair value hedges
generally have a maturity date within one year.

Net Investment Hedges

We had no
net investment hedge activity in 2009. In September 2008, we liquidated a $30.0 net investment hedge of a Swiss subsidiary. Investment hedge settlements are presented as investing cash flows when contracts are settled.

Hedge Effectiveness

We have determined all hedges to be highly effective and as a
result, have not recorded any material amounts for ineffectiveness.

Derivatives Not Qualifying for Hedge Accounting Treatment

At December 31, 2009, we had one derivative transaction that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on this
transaction are recorded directly to income and expense in the period impacted, and offset the majority of gains and losses on the underlying Euro inter-company debt.



The following table sets forth the pre-tax gains (losses) from continuing operations for our
hedging activities for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.

T—Contingencies

We are involved in various legal proceedings including matters which involve claims against us under employment, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws. When it appears probable in
management’s judgment that we will incur monetary damages or other costs in connection with claims and proceedings, and the costs can be reasonably estimated, appropriate liabilities are recorded in the financial statements and charges are made
against earnings. No claim or proceeding has resulted in a material charge against earnings, nor are the total liabilities recorded material to our financial position for any of the periods presented. While the results of any ultimate resolution
cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the possibility of a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity from claims and proceedings is remote.

On July 22, 2004, we were named as one of approximately 80
defendants in several cases consolidated as Gray v. Derderian, Case No. 1:04-CV-312-L, U.S.D.C. R.I. This litigation resulted from a nightclub fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island involving multiple deaths and injuries. There are in excess of 550
plaintiffs in the litigation. Along with other foam manufacturing defendants, we were alleged to have manufactured and sold bulk polyurethane foam to a foam fabricator in Rhode Island, who in turn, was alleged to have fabricated and sold foam sheets
to the nightclub. The foam was among other materials alleged to have caught fire when pyrotechnics were ignited inside the nightclub.

We believe we did not manufacture the foam subject to the lawsuit and that we have valid defenses to the claims. Nevertheless, with our
consent, our primary insurance carrier reached a tentative settlement with counsel for all plaintiffs on April 29, 2008 and we executed the final settlement agreement on October 6, 2009. The settlement agreement is subject to various
court approvals and the signature of all plaintiffs. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we would pay a $2 self-insured retention. The remainder of the $18.2 settlement would be paid by our insurance carrier. Management does not believe the
settlement or the outcome will have a material effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations. We recorded $2 of expense in 2008 and currently have a $16.2 receivable from the insurance carrier and an $18.2
liability related to this matter, that is included in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Quarterly Summary of Earnings

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated

(Unaudited)

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

*

Earnings in the first two quarters of 2009 were significantly impacted as we consumed the majority of higher cost steel but recognized only about half of the offsetting LIFO
benefit (consistent with our historical practice of recording annual LIFO impacts evenly throughout the year). The remainder of the LIFO benefit was recognized in the last half of 2009, a period during which we experienced only minimal impact from
higher cost steel.

**

Quarterly financial data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of noncontrolling interests from “Other expense (income), net to (Earnings) loss
attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax”.
