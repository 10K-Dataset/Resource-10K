PART I

PART I

Item 1. Business.

Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores, automobiles and commercial aircraft. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 20 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing & Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.

Overview of Our Segments

Residential Furnishings Segment

Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.  Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.

Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves. In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.



PART I

Products

Products manufactured or distributed by our Residential Furnishings groups include:

Bedding Group

•

Innersprings (sets of steel coils, bound together, that form the core of a mattress)

•

Wire forms for mattress foundations

Furniture Group

•

Steel mechanisms and hardware (enabling furniture to recline, tilt, swivel, rock and elevate) for reclining chairs and sleeper sofas

•

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs, sofas and love seats

•

Steel tubular seat frames

•

Bed frames, ornamental beds, and “top-of-bed” accessories

•

Adjustable beds

Fabric & Carpet Underlay Group

•

Structural fabrics for mattresses, residential furniture and industrial uses

•

Carpet underlay materials (bonded scrap foam, felt, rubber and prime foam)

•

Geo components (synthetic fabrics and various other products used in ground stabilization, drainage protection, erosion and weed control, as well as silt fencing)

Customers

Most of our Residential Furnishings customers are manufacturers of finished bedding products (mattresses and foundations) or upholstered furniture for residential use. We also sell many products, including ornamental beds, bed frames, adjustable beds, carpet underlay, and top-of-bed accessories, directly to retailers and distributors. We sell Geo Components products primarily to dealers, contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies.

Commercial Fixturing & Components Segment

Our Store Fixtures group designs, produces, installs and manages our customers’ store fixtures projects. Our Office Furniture Components group designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of engineered components targeted for the office seating market.

Industrial Materials Segment

We believe that the quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing. Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills. We have four wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. Our Steel Tubing business unit also supplies nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing. In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.

On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western).  Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.  Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.  For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 104 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Strategic Direction

Key Financial Metric

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price). Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.

We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2012 we generated TSR of 16% per year, on average, which places us in the top 37% of the S&P 500. In addition, our TSR has exceeded that of the S&P 500 index for five consecutive years.

Our incentive programs reward return generation. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit’s direct control.



PART I

Returning Cash to Shareholders

During the past three years, we generated $1.14 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR.

Since late 2007, we have raised quarterly dividends by 61%, from $.18 per share to $.29 per share currently.  Our dividend payout target is 50-60% of earnings; however we have been above that target in recent years.  Our dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) was 92%,106% and 67% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.  As our markets recover, we expect to move back into our target payout range. In the meantime, we expect to generate enough cash to continue to pay and modestly grow the dividend. The Company has consistently (for over 20 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.

We expect to use cash (after funding capital expenditures, dividends, and growth opportunities) for share repurchases.  During the past three years, we have repurchased 18.3 million shares of our stock (and issued 11.6 million shares through employee benefit plans), which reduced the net outstanding shares by 4.5%. In 2012, we repurchased 2.0 million shares (which includes shares withheld for taxes in option exercises and stock unit conversions; and forfeited stock units) at an average per share price of $25.35 (and issued 4.7 million shares through employee benefit plans).  As discussed in more detail below under “Acquisitions,” we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million in January 2012. As such, the level of share repurchases was lower in 2012 than in recent years and our shares outstanding rose by 2% to roughly 142 million at year-end.

Portfolio Management

We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), operating cash flows, and return on assets. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.

Disciplined Growth

Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity. First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.

Our long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We seek acquisitions within our growth businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable



PART I

competitive advantage, and a strong fit with the Company; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return and have an internal rate of return in excess of 10%; (c) for stand-alone companies: generally, revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on companies: generally, revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.

Acquisitions

In January 2012, we acquired for a cash purchase price of $188 million, Western Pneumatic Tube, which produces thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products for aerospace applications.  Western fabricates products from specialty materials, such as titanium, nickel, stainless steel, and other high strength metals for use in aircraft systems and aircraft engine systems, including fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, life support, stability, and cooling systems.  Western operates two facilities, one in Kirkland, Washington, and another in Poway, California, and is part of our Industrial Materials segment.  For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 104 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We had no significant acquisitions in 2010 and 2011.

Divestitures

There were no significant divestitures in 2011 or 2012.

We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment) in the third quarter of 2010. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit. Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.  This unit sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and health care industries.

For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 75 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Financial Information

For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 80 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

Foreign Operations

The percentages of our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.

Our international operations are principally located in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico. The products we make in these countries primarily consist of:

China

•

Innersprings for mattresses

•

Recliner mechanisms and bases for upholstered furniture

•

Formed wire for upholstered furniture

Shafts for the appliance industry



PART I

Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for components is growing. Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.

Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

•

Foreign currency fluctuation

•

Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights

•

Credit risks

•

Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates

•

Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war

•

Inconsistent interpretation and enforcement, at times, of foreign tax schemes

•

Political instability in certain countries

Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 75% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.

Geographic Areas of Operation

We have manufacturing facilities in countries around the world, as shown below.



PART I

For further information concerning our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 80 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sales by Product Line

The following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales by classes of similar products for the last three years:

Distribution of Products

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.

Raw Materials

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

•

Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, coil, sheet, stainless and angle iron

•

Foam scrap

•

Woven and non-woven fabrics

•

Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:

•

Innersprings and foundations for mattresses

•

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas

•

Automotive seating components

We supply the majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire. We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.



PART I

Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2012, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 24% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing & Components and Specialized Products segments.

Patents and Trademarks

The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2012. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole. Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.

PART I

Research and Development

We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of research and development to be approximately $20 million per year in each of the last three years.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 18,300 employees, of which roughly 12,900 were engaged in production. Of the 18,300, approximately 8,600 were international employees (5,000 in China). Labor unions represented roughly 14% of our employees. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2012. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2013. The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 18,300 employees.

Competition

Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.

We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

•

Components for residential furniture and bedding

•

Carpet underlay

•

Adjustable bed bases

•

Components for office furniture

•

Drawn steel wire

•

Automotive seat support and lumbar systems

•

Bedding industry machinery for wire forming, sewing and quilting

•

Thin-walled, titanium, nickel and other specialty tubing for the aerospace industry



PART I

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.

Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-15%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices. We expect these products to continue to grow. Some of our traditional bedding customers are now offering mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel. These hybrid products, which allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring, are being well received by consumers.

Since early 2009, there have been antidumping duty rates on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.  These rates are expected to remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.

Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses. Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.

•

Residential Furnishings:

typically does not exhibit any significant seasonality, except for a reduction in fourth quarter sales.

•

Commercial Fixturing & Components:

generally has modestly stronger third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the fourth quarter significantly lower. This aligns with the retail industry’s normal construction cycle—the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.

•

Industrial Materials:

minimal variation in sales throughout the year.

•

Specialized Products:

relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.

Backlog

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.



PART I

Working Capital Items

For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of “Cash from Operations” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 39.

Government Contracts

The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from Government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any Government.

Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

Internet Access to Information

We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section.

Discontinued Operations

Two of our prior businesses (the Storage Products business unit, which was previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment and the Prime Foam Products business unit, which was previously reported in the Residential Furnishing segment) are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses.

We divested the Storage Products business unit in the third quarter of 2010. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit. Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.  This unit sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and health care industries.

During the second quarter of 2012, we received a cash litigation settlement of $3.9 million related to our former Prime Foam Products unit, which was sold in March 2007.  This business unit produced foam primarily used for cushioning by upholstered furniture and bedding manufacturers.

For further information on these discontinued operations, see Note B on page 75 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.

We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flow and earnings.

As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns. Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products. Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence. To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, energy costs and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses. Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world. Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.  Many consumers continue to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture.  If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.

Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.

Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs move with the market. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.

Steel is our principal raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years. This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year. Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap. We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.

As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).  If scrap costs raise more rapidly than the price of steel rod, the metal margins within our rod producing operation will be compressed.  Compressed metal margins could negatively impact our result of operations.

Higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods. In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components. This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins. This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.



PART I

Competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.

We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well. We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.

Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-15%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices. If sales of foam or air core mattresses continue to grow appreciably, it could reduce our market share in the U.S. bedding market, and negatively impact our sales and earnings.

Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.

A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2012, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $1.2 billion, or approximately 37% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled approximately $718 million, or approximately 22% of total assets.

We review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2012 indicated no goodwill impairments, but fair market value for one of our ten reporting units (Store Fixtures) only exceeded book value by approximately 10%. The fair market values of all other reporting units exceeded book value by more than 35%. The goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures reporting unit was $111 million at December 31, 2012.  The unit is dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.  Although recent performance has met expectations, the predictability of future results is less certain than that of our other reporting units due to the project nature of this business.  If we are not able to maintain current performance levels, future impairments could be possible.

If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.

We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2012, 27% of our sales were generated by international operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.



PART I

Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities. We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of, and collections from, our customers, and manage the accounting for, and payment to, our vendors. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems. If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.

New “conflict minerals” regulations may adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of conflict minerals or components which contain conflict minerals, and may result in loss of sales, additional expenses and reduced profitability.

On August 22, 2012, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted new disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold, known as conflict minerals, if these minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of the company's products. These regulations require such issuers to report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of certain electronic components, including those assembled into our products.

In addition, we may incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are DRC conflict-free, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict-free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of sales. These new requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.

Deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our sales, earnings, cash flows and liquidity.

We serve customers in a variety of industries, some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand.  A sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could adversely impact our sales, earnings, cash flow and liquidity.

We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.

Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.



PART I

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

The Company’s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri. We currently have 135 manufacturing locations, of which 91 are located across the United States and 44 are located in 16 foreign countries. We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities. However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.

Manufacturing Locations by Segment

__________________________________________________________

Manufacturing locations that we own produced approximately 70% of our sales in 2012. We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs). For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 88 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the opinion of management the Company’s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products. Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base. Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels. With our current utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate over $4 billion in revenue (assuming current sales mix).

To trim unproductive capacity and reduce overhead costs, management, in December 2011, approved a restructuring plan which included the closure of four underperforming branches. Of the closed branches, one was in the Residential Furnishings segment, one was in Commercial Fixturing & Components and two were in the Industrial Materials segment.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol LEG). The table below highlights quarterly and annual stock market information for the last two years.

______________________________

Price and volume data reflect composite transactions; price range reflects intra-day prices; data source is Bloomberg.

Shareholders and Dividends

As of February 11, 2013, we had 9,533 shareholders of record.

We expect to continue to pay dividends on our common stock and we are targeting a dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) of 50-60%, though it has been and will likely be higher for the near term. Our dividend payout ratio was 92%, 106% and 67% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. See the discussion of the Company’s targeted dividend payout under “Pay Dividends” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 38.

During 2012, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five of them, given its decision  to accelerate the first quarter 2013 dividend payment into December 2012.  For 2013, the Company expects to return to its typical dividend schedule, which is to declare four dividend payments.  However, during 2013, we expect to pay only three dividends with the fourth payment to be made in January 2014.  The five dividend payments in 2012 utilized approximately $200 million of cash while the three expected payments in 2013 are anticipated to utilize roughly $125 million of cash.



PART II

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The table below is a listing of our purchases of the Company’s common stock during each calendar month of the fourth quarter of 2012.

PART II

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

2012 HIGHLIGHTS

Demand continued to improve in several of our markets during 2012. Sales grew in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Adjustable Bed, Geo Components, Carpet Underlay, and parts of our home furniture components business. Growth in unit volumes was partially offset by lower trade sales at our steel mill and changes in currency rates.

Higher unit volumes led to improved earnings and record earnings per share from continuing operations.  Earnings also benefited from cost improvements and the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.

In January 2012 we purchased Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems. This was our first significant acquisition since 2007, and established for us a strong competitive position in a higher return, higher growth market.

Operating cash for the full year increased significantly on stronger earnings and improvements in working capital levels.  We again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 20 years.

2012 marked the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period.  Only two other S&P 500 companies can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.

Our financial profile remains strong. We ended 2012 with net debt to net capital slightly below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range. In August we issued $300 million of 10-year senior notes and used the proceeds to pay down commercial paper. We ended the year with the entire $600 million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility.

We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. We target TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long term. For the three years ended December 31, 2012, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average. That places us in the top 37% of the S&P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.

These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.



PART II

INTRODUCTION

Total Shareholder Return

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price]. We seek to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S&P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.

We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2012, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, compared to 11% for the S&P 500 index. That places us in the top 37% of the S&P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.

Our incentive programs reward improved return on investment. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit’s direct control.

Customers

We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 6% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.

Major Factors That Impact Our Business

Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.

Market Demand

Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates. All these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.

Demand improved in several of our markets during 2012. As expected, we realized significant earnings leverage as unit volumes grew, and this led to improved margins.

Over the last few years we have significantly reduced our fixed cost structure, but purposely retained spare production capacity.  Accordingly, unit sales can increase appreciably without the need for large capital investment.  We have meaningful operating leverage that should further benefit earnings as market demand continues to improve.  With our current utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate over $4 billion in revenue (assuming current sales mix). Until our spare capacity is fully utilized, each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume is expected to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.



PART II

Raw Material Costs

In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials. This purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have. Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.

We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.

Steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. In late 2010, steel costs began increasing, and we raised our selling prices in early 2011 to recover the majority of the higher costs. By mid-year 2011, market prices for certain types of steel had begun to decrease. The margin pressure we experienced in the last half of 2011 resulted in part from lowering our selling prices (selectively) in advance of our average cost of steel declining, in order to maintain market share and minimize deterioration in product mix.  The alignment of costs and pricing improved in 2012.  During the year, we experienced month-to-month variability in steel costs, but overall for 2012, costs decreased slightly.

As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Steel scrap costs (and metal margins) were relatively stable for the majority of 2011.  As mentioned above, in 2012 we experienced month-to-month variability in steel scrap costs and steel rod pricing, however for the full year, metal margins were comparable to 2011.

Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.

When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We experienced this de-contenting effect in our Residential Furnishings segment in the back half of 2011 (however selective selling price reductions helped contain this activity). As our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address commodity inflation, our profit margins were negatively impacted. We must continue to find ways to assist our customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.

Competition

Many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.



PART II

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.  The margin pressure we experienced in the last half of 2011 resulted in part from price competition in certain of our businesses as we reduced prices (selectively) to maintain market share in light of depressed industry volume.

Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-15%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices. We expect these products to continue to grow. Some of our traditional bedding customers are now offering mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel. These hybrid products, which allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring, are being well received by consumers.

We filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam which was brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009. The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin. In 2009, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.

2011 Restructuring Plan

In December 2011, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our overhead costs and improve ongoing profitability. The activities primarily entailed the closure of four underperforming facilities. We incurred a $37 million pre-tax (largely non-cash) charge in the 4

th

quarter of 2011 primarily related to this plan, which included $31 million of long-lived asset impairments and $6 million of other restructuring-related costs. During 2012, we incurred an additional $2 million of restructuring-related costs and $1 million of long-lived asset impairments related to this plan.  These activities were substantially complete by the end of 2012 and no significant additional costs related to the plan are expected.



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2012 vs. 2011

Demand improved in many of our markets during 2012. Growth in unit volumes was partially offset by lower trade sales at our steel mill (sales shifted from trade to intra-segment) and changes in currency rates.

Earnings increased significantly, from $153 million in 2011 to $248 million in 2012.  This improvement reflects several factors, including lower restructuring-related costs, higher unit volumes, benefits from special tax items, cost improvements, and earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.

Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.

Consolidated Results

The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2012, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.

Improved demand in several of our markets led to higher sales in 2012.  Same location sales increased 1%, with 3% unit volume growth partially offset by a 2% revenue decline from lower trade sales at our steel mill and changes in currency rates. Unit volumes grew during the year in  Automotive, U.S. Spring, Adjustable Bed, Geo Components, Carpet Underlay, and certain parts of our home furniture components business.  The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2012 was largely offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with 2011.



PART II

Earnings increased significantly in 2012 due to several factors.  Operationally, these included higher unit volumes, cost improvements, and earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.  The other items detailed in the table above also collectively contributed to the earnings increase.  In 2011, earnings were reduced by restructuring-related costs primarily associated with the December 2011 Plan discussed on page 28.  In 2012, earnings benefited from special tax items, which included the elimination of a valuation allowance on Canadian deferred tax assets.

LIFO Impact

All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. Moderate inflation resulted in LIFO expense of $14 million in 2011.  In 2012, lower commodity costs led to a LIFO benefit of $15 million.

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense in 2012 was $5 million higher than in 2011, primarily due to the issuance in August 2012 of $300 million of long-term notes.

The 2012 effective income tax rate of 18.5% on continuing operations was lower than the 24.2% incurred in 2011.  The 2012 tax rate benefited from the fourth quarter release of a $38 million valuation allowance on certain Canadian deferred tax assets (primarily tax loss carryforwards).  As a result of an increase in operating earnings in Canada, the amalgamation of two Canadian subsidiaries, and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in Canadian tax law, we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years. The 2012 tax rate also benefited from the second quarter recording of a $6 million deferred tax asset for the tax basis of a subsidiary which is likely to be realized in 2013. These benefits were partially offset by the fourth quarter accrual of $11 million of withholding taxes on earnings in China, which was required since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all these earnings within China.  We also experienced other, less significant, discrete tax items (both favorable and unfavorable) that substantially offset for the year.  Excluding the net impact of all these items, our 2012 effective tax rate would have been approximately 30%.  We expect an ongoing cash flow benefit of $3 million to $4 million per year for the next 10 to 15 years as the Canadian tax loss carryforwards are utilized.

The 2011 tax rate benefited from changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions, one-time tax planning strategies, and the settlement of our 2004 through 2008 IRS examination.  As a result of the tax planning strategies and tax audit, we recognized tax benefits of $5 million in 2011.

On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which retroactively extended certain corporate tax provisions. Although several of these provisions will benefit our 2013 tax rate, we do not expect a material impact as a result of this legislation.



PART II

Segment Results

In the following section we discuss 2012 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 80.

______________________________

(1)

This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.

(2)

Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales increased 4% in 2012, entirely from higher unit volumes. Demand improved in several of our residential markets during the year.  In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 4%, in large part from growth of Comfort Core®, which is our pocketed coil product offering.  Strong market reception of hybrid mattresses is helping to drive growth in this category. We again had significant growth in adjustable beds, with unit volumes up 27% in 2012. Sales also grew in geo components, carpet underlay, seating components, and sofa sleepers.  These improvements were partially offset by a 4% decrease in furniture hardware unit volumes and declines in our International Spring business.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012, primarily due to higher sales and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $7 million).



PART II

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Sales in Commercial Fixturing & Components decreased 5% in 2012, due to the divestiture of our U.K.-based point-of-purchase display operation in January 2012.  Apart from the divestiture, sales in the segment were flat with 2011. Volumes in the Store Fixtures business were roughly flat for the year, with significantly lower spending by certain retailers offset by large programs (in the third quarter) associated with a major customer's re-branding initiative.  Sales in our Office Furniture Components business were also essentially unchanged, which we believe was consistent with 2012 demand trends in the office seating market.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012, primarily benefiting from prior cost improvement initiatives and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $3 million).

Industrial Materials

Sales in the segment increased 3% in 2012, with revenue from acquisitions partially offset by lower trade sales from our steel mill.  The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2012 was largely offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with 2011.  The rod mill continues to operate at full capacity.  Despite the negative sales comparisons they create, lower trade sales of rod are generally neutral to earnings if production levels are stable and we're consuming the rod in our own wire mills.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus 2011, primarily due to the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $22 million), cost improvements, and earnings from acquisitions. EBIT margins also increased during the year as a result of the change in sales from trade to intra-segment at our steel rod mill. This sales shift is beneficial to margins since it decreases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels.

Segment sales and EBIT benefited from the acquisition (in January 2012) of Western Pneumatic Tube.  That business, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, exceeded our initial first year forecast, and as expected, generated EBIT margins greater than the company average.

Specialized Products

In Specialized Products, sales increased 3% in 2012, with growth in Automotive partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates.  Sales also increased slightly in Commercial Vehicle Products, but Machinery volumes were down versus the prior year.  Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth during 2012 in North America and Asia, but sales declined in Europe from currency impacts and ongoing economic weakness.

EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012 primarily from higher sales and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $5 million).

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, was not material in either year (2011 or 2012).



PART II

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2011 vs. 2010

Sales growth in 2011 was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings. The main revenue catalyst was raw material-related price inflation, but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade) also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was up slightly. Full-year earnings decreased, from $177 million in 2010 to $153 million in 2011 primarily from higher restructuring-related costs.

Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.

Consolidated Results

The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2011, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.

Sales grew 8% in 2011, largely from inflation and currency rate changes. Unit volumes grew 3% primarily due to a shift in the mix of sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade). Across the bulk of our businesses, in aggregate, market demand increased slightly.



PART II

Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011, with automotive and office furniture leading the way. In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets. Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness.

Earnings decreased in 2011, largely due to restructuring-related costs associated with the decision (in the fourth quarter) to close certain manufacturing facilities. Other factors, including slightly higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate, and higher selling, administrative, and other costs essentially offset during the year.

LIFO Impact

All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. In both 2011 and 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense ($14 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2010).

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense in 2011 was roughly flat with 2010.

The 2011 consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate of 24.2% was lower than the 28.1% incurred in 2010. Several factors contributed to the reduction, including changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions, one-time benefits from tax planning strategies, and tentative agreement reached with the IRS regarding the examination of our 2004 through 2008 tax years. As a result of the tax planning strategies and audit, we recognized tax benefits of $5 million in 2011. This was comparable to a tax benefit realized in 2010 related to the IRS examination in that year of certain tax credit claims, which was substantially offset by incremental taxes from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings in that year. We also experienced other less significant, discrete tax items (both favorable and unfavorable) that substantially offset for the year.



PART II

Segment Results

In the following section we discuss 2011 sales and EBIT for each of our segments. We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 80.

______________________________

(1)

This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures. These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.

(2)

Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.

Residential Furnishings

Residential Furnishings sales increased in 2011, primarily from inflation and currency, which generated little profit. Unit volume in the segment was flat. Demand in most of our residential markets continued to be soft as consumers postponed spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture. Full-year 2011 unit volumes were essentially flat in our U.S. Spring business but declined in International Spring and Furniture Hardware (from pronounced market weakness mid-year). The only business in the segment that posted meaningful unit growth in 2011 was our Adjustable Bed business, where unit volumes grew 44% for the full year.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, primarily due to higher restructuring-related costs (of $9 million), less favorable sales mix, inflation, and other operating cost increases.

We initiated restructuring activities in the last half of 2011 in an effort to improve ongoing profitability, and part of that activity occurred in Residential Furnishings. We consolidated four operations in the segment, including two carpet underlay plants, a Canadian spring facility, and a fabric coating business.



PART II

Commercial Fixturing & Components

Sales decreased in 2011, largely from lower demand in our Store Fixtures business, as some of the large, value-oriented retailers significantly curtailed both new store construction and remodeling activity during the year. In contrast, market demand continued to improve in Office Furniture Components as that business posted strong growth in 2011. EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus 2010, primarily due to lower sales in the Store Fixtures business.

Our efforts to improve ongoing profitability resulted in the decision late in 2011 to consolidate one of our six remaining store fixture locations.

Industrial Materials

2011 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill, both of which generated little incremental profit. Full-year unit volumes declined in both Wire Drawing and Steel Tubing, reflecting weak bedding, furniture, and store fixtures end markets.

EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, mainly from higher restructuring-related costs (of $23 million). EBIT margins also decreased during 2011 as a result of a change in sales from intra-segment to trade at our steel rod mill. This sales shift is dilutive to margins since it results in a higher level of reported sales without increasing the level of reported EBIT. Reported earnings are roughly comparable despite whether rod is sold to our wire mills (intra-segment) or to trade customers.

Restructuring activities in late 2011 involved the closure of two facilities in the segment. We closed one of our six domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into two of the remaining plants. We also announced the closing of a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks into the domestic appliance industry.

Specialized Products

In Specialized Products, sales increased in 2011, primarily reflecting improved demand across the major businesses in the segment. Changes in currency exchange rates also added to year-over-year sales growth. Automotive growth continued to benefit from the recovery in global industry production.

EBIT increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales partially offset by higher restructuring-related costs (of $7 million), raw material cost inflation, and currency impacts. EBIT margins were flat.

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, was not material in either year (2010 or 2011).



PART II

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION

Our operations provide most of the cash we require. Debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs. In 2012, cash from operations increased significantly from higher earnings and improvements in working capital levels.  For over 20 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments. We expect this once again to be the case in 2013.

We ended 2012 with net debt to net capital at 29%, slightly below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of 30-40%, and consistent with year-end 2011 levels. The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 43.

In August 2012, we issued $300 million of 10-year notes.  With the proceeds, we reduced our use of commercial paper and ended the year with our entire $600 million commercial paper program and revolving credit agreement fully available.

Uses of Cash

Finance Capital Requirements

Cash is readily available to fund growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).

Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand manufacturing capacity. As shown in the chart above, capital expenditures have been stable in recent years. In all of our businesses, we invest to maintain facilities and equipment. We also invest to support new product introductions and specific product categories that are rapidly growing. However, with excess productive capacity across our operations (from continued low demand levels), we have had relatively low spending on expansion projects. We expect capital expenditures of less than $100 million in 2013. The expected increase versus 2012 primarily relates to new programs that we have been awarded, and that should contribute to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2014.



PART II

Our strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We are seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). During 2008 through 2010, acquisitions were a lower priority as we primarily focused on improving margins and returns of our existing businesses. As a result, no significant acquisitions were completed in 2010 or 2011.  In 2011, we again turned our focus to acquisitions and began actively soliciting opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline.  In January 2012, we purchased Western Pneumatic Tube for $188 million. This acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.  Western established for us a strong competitive position in the higher return, higher growth aerospace market.

Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 104.

Pay Dividends

Dividends are the primary means by which we return cash to shareholders. During 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of individual tax rate increases.  The chart above reflects that accelerated dividend payment.  In 2013, we expect to return to our typical dividend schedule (and pay the fourth quarter dividend in 2014), therefore the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 will be lower, at approximately $125 million.

Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority. In 2012, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.29 per share and extended to 41 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound growth rate of 13%. Our targeted dividend payout is approximately 50-60% of net earnings. Actual payout has been higher in recent years, but as earnings continue to grow, we expect to move into that target range.



PART II

Repurchase Stock

Stock repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders. During the past three years, we repurchased a total of 18 million shares of our stock and issued 12 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans, reducing outstanding shares by 5%. Given the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube early in the year, our share repurchases in 2012 were below those of recent years.  During 2012, we repurchased 2 million shares (at an average of $25.35) and issued 5 million shares (at an average of $18.30).  Two-thirds of the issuances related to employee stock option exercises, which increased notably in 2012 with the significant share price appreciation during the year.

Consistent with our stated priorities, we expect to use remaining operating cash (after funding capital expenditures, dividends, and acquisitions) to prudently buy back our stock, subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation, and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company.  We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.

Cash from Operations

Cash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.



PART II

Cash from operations increased 37%, to $450 million during 2012, on stronger earnings and improvements in working capital levels (largely from reductions in accounts receivable). In 2011, cash from operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings.

We continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended the year with adjusted working capital at 13.2% of annualized sales


, notably better than our 15% target.  The table below shows this calculation.  We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement.

1.

Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($853 million in 2012 and $854 million in 2011) multiplied by 4.  We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.

2.

The increase in adjusted working capital relates primarily to the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend ($41 million).

The following table presents dollar amounts related to key working capital components at the end of the past two years.

______________________________

Trade receivables decreased from year-end 2011 levels, primarily due to lower trade sales late in the year in certain businesses and improved credit terms with certain customers.

Inventory increased from year-end 2011, primarily due to: i) acquisitions; ii) decisions to take advantage of temporarily lower commodity costs near the end of 2012 in certain businesses, and iii) higher production in late 2012 for programs that ship in early 2013.

Accounts Payable also increased primarily due to the opportunistic purchases of raw materials and higher production in late 2012, both of which also impacted inventory levels.



PART II

The next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).

Working Capital Trends

1.

The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables ÷ (quarterly net sales ÷ number of days in the quarter).

2.

The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory ÷ (quarterly cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the quarter).

3.

The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable ÷ (quarterly cost of goods sold ÷ number of days in the quarter).

Changes in the quarterly Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) reflect normal seasonal fluctuations due to the timing of cash collection and other factors.  The decrease in the fourth quarter DSO was driven by improved payment patterns with several large customers, and some customers taking advantage of cash discounts and other incentives for early payment.  In 2012, we incurred $4 million of customer bad debt expense as compared to $6 million in 2011, which is largely a reflection of a modest improvement in the financial stability of customers in the majority of our markets. We expect DSO in 2013 to follow our normal seasonal pattern.

Our Days Inventory on Hand (DIO) increased compared to the prior year primarily due to decisions to take advantage of temporarily lower commodity costs near the end of 2012 in certain businesses and higher production in late 2012 for programs that ship in early 2013. We do not expect that either of these situations will increase our exposure to obsolete and slow moving inventory.  During both 2012 and 2011, we recognized expense of $10 million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories.

We actively strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors, and over the last few years, have increased our Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) by more than ten days. We expect that we will be able to continue this favorable trend going forward.



PART II

Working capital levels vary by segment. The Commercial Fixturing & Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the Store Fixtures group. This business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.

Capitalization

This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.

___________________________________________

(1)

These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.  The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps.

(2)

Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases. Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.



PART II

The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2012 and 2011, calculated in two ways:

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.

•

Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.

We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.

Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $220 million in 2012, in part from the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube.

In August 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal of notes that mature in 2022 unless redeemed earlier.  The notes bear interest at a rate of 3.4% per year, with interest payable semi-annually beginning on February 15, 2013.  The net proceeds of the notes were used to pay down commercial paper, which in turn provided borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, the repayment of existing indebtedness, the funding of possible future acquisitions, and stock repurchases.

As a part of the above issuance, we also unwound the $200 million forward starting interest swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of approximately $43 million, which will be amortized over the life of the notes.  This results in a fully weighted effective interest rate of 5.0% associated with the notes.



PART II

Short Term Borrowings

We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 13 lenders. This agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five-year term ending in 2016. The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250 million. When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:

The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2012 was $200 million and $382 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $4 million and $27 million respectively. Commercial paper amounts increased in January 2012 from the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube.  Subsequently, borrowing levels fluctuated due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements.  As discussed on the prior page, we used the proceeds from the notes we issued in August to pay down commercial paper, and ended the year with the entire $600 million program available. At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $68 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.

On April 1, 2013, we have $200 million of 4.7% notes that mature. With anticipated operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our expected ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have more than sufficient funds available to repay this maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.

Accessibility of Cash

At December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $359 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

A substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations. Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost. However, if we had to bring all the foreign cash back immediately, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to $42 million.  In 2011 we brought back $89 million of cash, and in 2012 we brought back $50 million, in each case at no added tax cost.



PART II

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2012:

_______________________________________________________________________________

1.

The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.

2.

Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.

3.

Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 at rates in effect at the end of the year.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.

“Critical accounting estimates” are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.

We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.

CONTINGENCIES

Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the probability that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost. Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC284 (“2010 Suit”). The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 (“2009 Suit”). The 2009 Suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff's failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders. As before, the plaintiff did not make such demand. On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice. On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.  On November 28, 2012, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal, and remanded the case back to the trial court finding that plaintiff sufficiently pled demand on the Board and shareholders.  We filed a request for transfer to the Missouri Supreme Court on December 12, 2012, which was denied by the Court of Appeals.  On January 3, 2013, we filed a transfer petition to the Missouri Supreme Court. On February 26, 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court denied our request. The case will be sent back to Jasper County, Missouri for further proceedings.  The 2010 Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.

The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.

The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants' stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs. The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from us. We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.

We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the 2010 Suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the Court's ruling in the 2009 Suit, this failure to make demand should not be excused; the dismissal of the 2009 Suit precludes the 2010 Suit; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the 2010 Suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant. As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.

We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.



PART II

Antitrust Lawsuits

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.

A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed, most without prejudice. Of the U.S. cases remaining, we have been named as a defendant in (a) three direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) and a consolidated amended class action complaint filed on February 28, 2011 on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products; (b) an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 (although the underlying lawsuits do not name us as a defendant); and an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011; (c) 36 individual direct purchaser cases, (i) one filed March 22, 2011, (ii) another amended August 24, 2011 to remove class allegations, (iii) one amended August 25, 2011 to name us as a defendant, (iv) three others filed October 31, 2011, (v) one filed November 4, 2011, (vi) three filed December 6, 19 and 30, 2011, respectively, (vii) one filed January 27, 2012, (viii) five filed March 19, 2012, (ix) one amended March 30, 2012 to name us as a defendant, (x) one filed April 27, 2012, (xi)  two filed April 30, 2012, (xii) two filed May 11, 2012, (xiii) one filed May 17, 2012, (xiv) four filed May 25, 2012, (xv) one filed June 12, 2012, (xvi)  four filed August 8, 2012, (xvii) one filed September 21, 2012, (xviii) one filed November 7, 2012 (which suit also makes indirect purchaser claims), and (xix) two filed January 9 and 15, 2013, respectively; and (d) a direct and indirect purchaser class action filed on November 29, 2012 asserting claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. All of the pending U.S. federal cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation

, Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.

In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations. On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim. On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss. Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.

We have been named in two Canadian class action cases (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products), both under the name

Hi Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.

in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 (amended November 2, 2011) and CV-11-17279 (issued December 30, 2011). In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 15 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100 million, punitive damages of $10 million, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the investigation and the action. We are not yet required to file our defenses in the Canadian actions.  In addition, on July 10, 2012, plaintiff in a class action case (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products) styled

Option Consommateurs and Karine Robillard v. Produits Vitafoam Canada Limitée, et. al.

in the Quebec Superior Court of Justice (Montréal), Court File No. 500-6-524-104, filed an amended motion for authorization seeking to add us and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products as defendants in this case.

On June 22, 2012, we were also made party to a lawsuit brought in the 16

th

Judicial Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, Case Number 1216-CV15179 under the caption “Dennis Baker, on Behalf of Himself and all Others Similarly Situated vs. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated - Polyurethane Foam Class Action.” The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and/or a class of indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products in the State of Missouri, alleged that we violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act based upon our alleged illegal price inflation of flexible polyurethane foam products. The plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages, punitive damages and the recovery of reasonable attorney fees. We filed a motion to dismiss this action, which was denied on November 5, 2012. Discovery has commenced.



PART II

We deny all of the allegations in all of the above actions and will vigorously defend ourselves. These contingencies are subject to many uncertainties. Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any, because, at this juncture of the proceedings, the damages sought by plaintiffs are unspecified, unsupported, and unexplained; discovery is incomplete (no depositions have been taken,  class certification issues are not yet ripe, expert liability reports have not been exchanged); and because the litigation involves unsettled legal theories.

Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters

On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett & Platt do Brasil Ltda. (“L&P Brazil”) in the amount of approximately $4 million, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43. The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L&P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.  L&P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.  On December 17, 2012, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued an additional notice of violation in the amount of approximately $6.2 million under MPF Case No. 0811000.2011.00438 covering the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 on the same subject matter. L&P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 17, 2013 denying the violation.  It is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation for years 2011 and 2012.

In addition, L&P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012 from the Brazilian Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L&P Brazil's use of certain tax credits in the years 2006 through 2010. Such credits are generated based upon the tariff classification and rate used by L&P Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings. Combined with prior assessments, L&P Brazil has received assessments totaling approximately $2.0 million on the same or similar denial of tax credit matters.

L&P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L&P Brazil seeking approximately $3.3 million for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n°.04-256.169/2009). The State of Sao Paulo argued that L&P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo. On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L&P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment. The State filed a special appeal and the Special Appeals court remanded the case back to the Court of Tax and Fees for further findings.  On November 9, 2012, the Court of Tax and Fees again ruled in favor of L&P Brazil and nullified the tax assessment.  On November 28, 2012, the State filed another special appeal. The determination to accept the special appeal was made on December 26, 2012, and L&P responded to this special appeal on January 24, 2013.

We were also informed on October 4, 2012 that the State of Sao Paulo issued an Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine dated May 29, 2012 under Procedure Number 4.003.484 against L&P Brazil in the amount of approximately $2.3 million for the tax years 2009 through 2011. Similar to the prior assessment, the State of Sao Paulo argues that L&P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.

On December 18, 2012, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil  issued a tax assessment to L&P Brazil relating to L&P Brazil's classifications of innersprings for the collection and payment of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings in Minas Gerais from March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012 in the amount of approximately $.7 million, under PTA Case No. 01.000.182756-62.  L&P Brazil filed its response denying any violation on January 17, 2013.



PART II

We deny all of the allegations in these actions. We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves. However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties. At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Patent Infringement Claim

On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 million based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs. This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive. Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.

On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent's validity and denied that we infringed any patent. At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 million.  The court denied plaintiff's attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.

On April 9, 2012 we appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.  Oral argument was held on February 6, 2013 before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C.  On February 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 million verdict against us.  We intend to request a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision.  If a rehearing is not granted, we have the right to request further review to the U.S. Supreme Court.  However, this review is discretionary.

If the case is finally affirmed and remanded to the trial court, the plaintiff might also request royalties for post-verdict use of the machines.  If so, we intend to object to such request.  We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue. The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of one of the three patents. The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second patent, but subsequently reversed that decision. With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims. All three of these proceedings are currently on appeal before the Board of Patent Appeals.  Due to a change made to all of the machines, we do not believe that the machines currently use the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.

At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

We adopted new accounting guidance in 2012, as discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71, which did not have a material impact on our current financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods, but we do not believe this new guidance will materially impact our future financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

(Unaudited)

(Dollar amounts in millions)

Interest Rates

The table below provides information about the Company’s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its $1,030 carrying value by $45.7 at December 31, 2012, and greater than its $730 carrying value by $29.2 at December 31, 2011. The increase in the fair market value of the Company’s debt is primarily due to the issuance of $300 of new notes in 2012, and the decrease in credit spreads as compared to the prior year end. The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2012 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated “spread” over such Treasury securities representing the Company’s interest costs for its medium-term notes. The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.

_______________________________________________________________________________

These rates exclude the amortization of interest rate swap.

2.

Includes $0 and $70.4 of commercial paper in 2012 and 2011, respectively, supported by a $600 revolving credit agreement which terminates in 2016.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks. The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is the Company’s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments. Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair value hedges is provided in Note S on page 105 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.

Investment in Foreign Subsidiaries

The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long-term commitment, and does not hedge translation exposures. The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes. The Company’s net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to translation exposure) in foreign subsidiaries at December 31 is as follows:

Effectiveness of the Company’s Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation as of December 31, 2012, was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2012, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART III

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.

The subsections entitled “Proposal 1—Election of Directors,” “Corporate Governance,” “Board and Committee Composition and Meetings,” “Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity,” “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance” and “Director Independence” in the Company’s definitive Proxy Statement for the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 9, 2013, are incorporated by reference.

Directors of the Company

Directors are normally elected annually at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. All current directors have been nominated for re-election at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held May 9, 2013, except for Maurice E. Purnell, Jr.  Mr. Purnell will retire from the Board on the date of the Annual Shareholder Meeting.

In order to be nominated for election as a director, a nominee must submit a contingent resignation to the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee (N&CG Committee).  The resignation will become effective only if (i) the director nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in the director election; and (ii) the Board accepts the resignation.  If a nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in the director election, the N&CG Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the director’s resignation and whether any other action should be taken. If a director’s resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company’s next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. If the Board accepts the director’s resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy.

The Company’s Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines set the director retirement age at 72; however, the Board Chair, CEO or President may request a waiver for any director. At the request of Leggett’s CEO, the N&CG Committee recommended, and the full Board granted, retirement age waivers for Directors Clark, Enloe and Fisher so they may stand for re-election at the 2013 annual meeting.

Brief biographies of the Company’s Board of Directors are provided below. Our employment agreements with Mr. Haffner and Mr. Glassman provide that they may terminate the agreement if not re-elected as a director. See the Exhibit Index on page 116 for reference to the agreements.

PART IV

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Leggett & Platt;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of Leggett & Platt are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Leggett & Platt; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett & Platt assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting, as of

December 31, 2012

, based on the criteria in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2012

.

Leggett & Platt’s internal control over financial reporting, as of

December 31, 2012

, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 65 of this Form 10-K.



PART IV

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at

December 31, 2012

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2012

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“we” or “our”). Prior to 2010, many subsidiaries outside of the United States were consolidated as of and for a fiscal year ended November 30. As of December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries converted to a calendar reporting year. The net impact of the change in fiscal years of these subsidiaries was immaterial, and is presented as an adjustment to January 1, 2010 retained earnings. Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. Legal costs are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs. Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable. Legal fees are accrued when incurred.

CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a trade note receivable to facilitate our customers’ operating cycles. Nontrade notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business. Notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.

The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses. Interest income is not recognized for accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status. Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience. Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.

INVENTORIES: All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity. The cost for approximately

60%

of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap. For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs. For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.

Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value. We have had no material changes in inventory writedowns or slow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves in any of the years presented.

DIVESTITURES: Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:

Discontinued Operations

—A business is classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions. Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.



If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement. Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations. Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.

Assets Held for Sale

—An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control. Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed. Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed. After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell. The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.

Assets Held for Use

—If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use. Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill. In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, in a held for use business, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal. The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.

Property is tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.

GOODWILL: Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur. We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year. Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Our reporting units are the


business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.

If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the business groups. In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price-to-earnings ratios. Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, internal sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements. Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment. There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.



OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award.

SALES RECOGNITION: We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination. The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination. We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers nor is it our practice to replace goods damaged or lost in transit. Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of “Cost of goods sold.”

RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities. Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities. We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred. Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.

INCOME TAXES: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized. A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.

The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management’s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F. Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.

We maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged. Management also monitors the financial condition and status of noncustomer receivables. Noncustomer receivables primarily consist of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business. Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.

We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.

From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt. To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial



institutions that meet certain requirements are used. We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.

The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.

OTHER RISKS: Although we obtain insurance for workers’ compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles. Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported. Provisions for losses are recorded based upon reasonable estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction. The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:

Cash Flow Hedge—

The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item. Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.

Fair Value Hedge—

The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge. For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item. Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates. The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2012 presentation:

•

In the Consolidated Balance Sheets – "Accounts and other receivables, net" is now presented separately as "Trade receivables, net" and "Other receivables, net".

•

In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows – Activity related to the change in commercial paper and short-term debt previously included in the “Additions to/Payments on debt” line items within Financing Activities is now presented separately.

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE: The FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods. The new guidance did not have a material impact on our current financial statements, and we do not believe any of the new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.



B—Discontinued Operations

Businesses divested in prior years and subsequent activity directly related to these divestitures have been reported as discontinued operations as follows:

•

2012 - We received a cash litigation settlement in the second quarter of 2012 associated with our former Prime Foam Products unit.  This unit was sold in March 2007 and was previously part of the Residential Furnishings segment.

•

2011 - We had no discontinued operations activity in 2011.

•

2010 - The Storage Products unit was sold in 2010 as part of a broad strategic change that occurred in 2007 and was previously part of the Commercial Fixturing & Components Segment.  No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.

The table below includes activity related to these divestitures, as well as a small amount of subsequent activity directly related to divestitures completed prior to 2010:

______________________________

(1)

Impairment charges were recorded to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as discussed in Note C.

C—Impairment Charges

Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.

Asset impairments associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Other expense (income), net.” Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.”



Other Long-Lived Assets

As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

In December 2011, management approved the 2011 Restructuring Plan which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming facilities and resulted in impairment charges of

$31.2

(

$19.0

for intangibles and

$12.2

for fixed assets) during 2011’s fourth quarter. In 2012, approximately

$1.2

of fixed asset impairments were related to this plan. These impairment charges were largely the result of lowered expectations of future cash flows in certain operations, including those that produce fabricated wire components used in home appliances. We also incurred restructuring charges associated with this plan as discussed in Note D.

Businesses Held for Sale

The Storage Products unit was sold in 2010 as part of a broad strategic change that occurred in 2007. As presented in the table above, asset impairment charges were recorded as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell for this business became more certain. Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers.

Goodwill

Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year or as triggering events may occur. We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year as discussed in Note A.

Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value. Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit. These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.

The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price-to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit. The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years. The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a

25%

control premium. Projected earnings are based upon market analysts’ projections. The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value. Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.

The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows. Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. Discounted cash flow projections are based on


-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.

Goodwill Impairment Reviews

The goodwill impairment reviews performed in each year presented indicated no goodwill impairments. Due to the limited nature and scope of changes to operations expected as a result of the 2011 Restructuring Plan, we concluded that a formal goodwill impairment review at December 31, 2011 was not necessary.

Reporting units’ fair values in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in the June 2012 review are presented in the table below. The 10-25% category below includes information for one reporting unit (Store Fixtures). The fair value of this unit exceeded its book value by 10% at the June 30, 2012 impairment review date. If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.



D—Restructuring

We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures. These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations. Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended December 31 were comprised of:

2011 Restructuring Plan

In December 2011, we adopted the 2011 Restructuring Plan which included the closure of

four

underperforming manufacturing facilities.

The following table contains information, by segment, regarding the amount of each major type of restructuring-related cost incurred in connection with the exit activities.

______________________________

The portion of the total restructuring charges in the above table that represents cash charges is

$3.7

.

(1)

Restructuring charges are reported on the Statements of Operations in “Other expense (income), net.”

(2)

The 2011 charges consist of

$1.2

of restructuring charges and

$1.6

of inventory obsolescence and other.



The accrued liability associated with the 2011 Restructuring Plan consisted of the following:

We also incurred impairment costs associated with this plan as discussed in Note C. These exit activities were substantially complete by the end of 2012 and no additional significant costs related to the plan are expected.

Other Initiatives

Apart from the 2011 Restructuring Plan, we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives over the last three years to improve our operating cost structures. None of these actions have individually resulted in a material charge to earnings. Total costs associated with these other initiatives have had the following impact on our financial statements:

Restructuring and restructuring-related charges (income) associated with continuing operations by segment for the other initiatives were as follows:



The accrued liability associated with Other Initiatives consisted of the following:

E—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset class and intangible assets acquired during the period presented included in "Other intangibles" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:



Estimated amortization expense for items included in our December 31, 2012 balance sheet in each of the next five years is as follows:

F—Segment Information

We have four operating segments that are generally focused on broad end-user markets for our diversified products:

•

Residential Furnishings—components for bedding, furniture and other furnishings, as well as related consumer products

Specialized Products—automotive seating components, specialized machinery and equipment, and commercial vehicle interiors

Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating decision maker. The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.

Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.

The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory. Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate performance based on earnings from operations before interest and income taxes (EBIT). Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment. Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales. These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.

A summary of segment results for the periods presented are shown in the following tables.



Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance. These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment. Segment assets for all years are reflected at their estimated average for the year. Acquired companies’ long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.

Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

We can raise cash by issuing up to

$600

of commercial paper through a program backed by our

five

-year

$600

revolving credit agreement dated August 19, 2011 with a syndicate of


lenders. Based on the information currently available to us, we believe the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement. The Company’s ability to borrow under the 2011 Agreement is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the 2011 Agreement. The amount of letters of credit is limited to

$250

. The Company currently has no outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 Agreement.

Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:

The revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit a) the total amount of indebtedness to

60%

of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit agreement), b) the amount of total secured debt to

15%

of our total consolidated assets, and c) the amount of assets sold, transferred or



disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to

20%

of total consolidated assets. We have remained well within compliance with all such covenants.

We may elect one of four types of borrowing under the 2011 Agreement, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance. The interest rate would be commensurate with the currency borrowed and the term of the borrowing, as well as either i.) a competitive variable or fixed rate, or ii.) various published rates plus a pre-defined spread.

The Company is required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the 2011 Agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period. Any outstanding principal under the 2011 Agreement will be due upon the maturity date. The Company may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under the 2011 Agreement, in whole or in part, upon three business days’ notice.

K—Lease Obligations

We lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets. Lease terms, including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs, vary by lease.

Total rental expense for the periods presented was as follows:

Future minimum rental commitments for all long-term non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:

The above lease obligations expire at various dates through 2019. Aggregate rental commitments above include renewal amounts where it is our intention to renew the lease.

L—Stock-Based Compensation

We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.

One

stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes. Shares are issued from treasury for the majority of our stock plans’ activity.

Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan. On May 10, 2012 the Flexible Stock Plan changed the way awards granted under the Plan are charged against the number of available shares.  Under the 2012 Plan modification, each option counts as

one

share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as

three

shares against the Plan.



At December 31, 2012, the following common shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:

The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on the results of operations for each of the years ended December 31:

When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a “windfall” tax benefit is created. The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital. When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax “shortfall” is created. To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls, the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital. Net windfall is presented below:

(1) Stock Option Grants

We have granted stock options in the following areas:

•

On a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees

•

In conjunction with our Deferred Compensation Program

•

As compensation of outside directors



Options granted to a broad group of employees on a discretionary basis

We have historically granted stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees. Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at

18 months

,

30 months

and

42 months

after the date of grant. Options have a maximum term of

ten

years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett’s closing stock price on the grant date.

Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are amortized by the straight-line method over the options’ total vesting period, except for employees who terminate due to retirement. A “retirement” termination occurs if the employee is age


, or age


with


years of Company service at termination. For retirement terminations, options continue to vest and remain exercisable for

three years, six months

after termination of employment. Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.

In connection with the January 2010 grant, officers received stock option awards. We gave other participants the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options. The value of the cash alternative (paid in the first quarter) was equal to approximately one-half of the Black Scholes value of the option grant the employee would have otherwise received.

In connection with the January 2011 and 2012 grants, we offered

two

different option choice programs.

One

group of employees was offered the same option/cash choice as in 2010, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone. Another group of employees, generally higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of

four

options foregone for every one RSU offered. The stock units vest in one-third increments at

12 months

,

24 months

and

36 months

after the date of grant.

Starting in 2013, options will only be offered in conjunction with the Deferred Compensation Program discussed below.  Options will be replaced with either cash awards or RSUs as offered in 2011 and 2012. Certain key management employees will participate in a new Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI) program.  The PGI awards will be issued as growth performance stock units (GPSUs).  The number of GPSUs that will ultimately vest will depend upon the Revenue Growth and EBITDA Margin of the Company or applicable profit center at the end of a

two

-year performance period.

Deferred Compensation Program

We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:

•

Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned. The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times

five

, divided by the stock’s market price on the date of grant. The option has a


-year term. It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning

15 months

after the grant date. Stock is issued when the option is exercised.

•

Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every

two

weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a

20%

discount to the market price of our common stock on the acquisition date and they vest immediately. Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned. Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock. These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a

20%

discount. Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant’s pre-set election. Beginning in 2010, stock units may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company. Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than

ten

years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed

ten

years.

•

Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.



STOCK OPTIONS SUMMARY

Stock option information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:

______________________________

*

Primarily outside directors’ options

**

Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program. During 2012,

245,324

options were exercised at a below market exercise price, and

144,087

of these options remain outstanding at December 31, 2012. In 2005, we amended the Program to provide only “at market” stock options.

Additional information related to stock option activity for the periods presented is as follows:

The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option. The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility, measured daily for a time period equal to the option’s expected life, ending on the day of grant. The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.



(2) Stock-Based Retirement Plans

We have

two

stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees. We make matching contributions to both plans. In addition to the automatic

50%

match, we will make another matching contribution of up to

50%

of the employee’s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.

•

Participants in the SBP may contribute up to

6%

of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices. We immediately match

50%

of the employee contributions. Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after

three

years of service. Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant’s election.

•

Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to

10%

(depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP. We immediately match

50%

of the employee contributions. Company contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at

85%

of the common stock market price on the acquisition date. Stock units are converted to common stock at a

1-to-1 ratio

upon distribution from the program. Beginning in 2010, units from the ESUP may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company. The ESUP offered no diversification opportunity for contributions through March 31, 2011.

Beginning April 1, 2011, participant contributions were credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we made premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to

17.65%

of the participant’s contribution. A participant’s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant. Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units in these accounts. The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are a component of “Other current assets” and “Sundry” long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Participant’s diversified investment accounts are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company, and are presented as a component of “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” in the accompanying balance sheet and will be settled in cash. Both the asset and liabilities associated with this program are presented in Note Q and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. Company matching contributions are in the form of stock units.

Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements. Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee’s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.

Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows:

Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.

(3) Performance Stock Unit Awards

We also grant Performance Stock Unit (PSU) awards in the first quarter of each year to selected officers and other key managers. These awards contain the following conditions:

•

A service requirement—Awards generally “cliff” vest

three

years following the grant date; and

•

A market condition—Awards are based on our Total Shareholder Return [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price] as compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies. The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S&P 500 and S&P Midcap 400



(approximately


companies). Participants will earn from

0%

to

175%

of the base award depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the


-year performance period.

Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies and are based upon assumptions similar to those used for stock options. Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the

three

-year vesting period.

Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU’s for the periods presented:

Beginning with the 2010 award (that was settled in January 2013), thirty-five percent (

35%

) of awards will be paid out in cash. We intend to pay out the remaining sixty-five percent (

65%

) in shares of our common stock, although we reserve the right to pay up to one hundred percent (

100%

) in cash. The

35%

portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.

(4) Restricted Stock Unit Awards

RSU awards are generally granted as follows:

•

To managers now receiving annual RSU grants in lieu of annual option grants

•

On a discretionary basis to selected managers

•

To selected executive officers in connection with employment agreements

•

As compensation for outside directors, who have a choice to receive RSUs or restricted stock

The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period. As discussed above, beginning in 2013, RSUs are awarded on a discretionary basis. In 2011 and 2012, selected employees could elect to receive RSUs in lieu of option awards.

STOCK UNITS SUMMARY

Stock unit information for the plans discussed above is presented in the table below. Prior to May 10, 2012,

one

stock unit was equivalent to one common share for authorized share usage. On May 10, 2012 the Flexible Stock Plan changed the way awards granted under the Plan are charged against the number of available shares.  Under the 2012 Plan modification, each option counts as

one

share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as

three

shares against the Plan.

PSU awards are presented at

175%

(i.e. maximum) payout

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST NOT YET RECOGNIZED

As of December 31, 2012, the unrecognized cost of non-vested stock options and units was as follows:

(5) Discount Stock Plan

Under the Discount Stock Plan (DSP), a tax-qualified §423 stock purchase plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of Leggett common stock at

85%

of the closing market price on the last business day of each month. Shares are purchased and issued on the last business day of each month and generally cannot be sold or transferred for one year.



M—Employee Benefit Plans

The accompanying balance sheets reflect a net liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Our U.S. plans (comprised primarily of three significant plans) represent

88%

of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.   Participants in one of the significant domestic plans have stopped earning benefits; this plan is referred to as "frozen" in the following narrative.

A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:



Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below:

Included in the above plans is a subsidiary’s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan. This is a non-qualified plan, and the subsidiary owns insurance policies for the participants that are not included in the plan’s assets with cash surrender values at December 31 as follows:

Comprehensive Income

Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions are reflected below:

Of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2012, the portions expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in 2013 are as follows:



Net Pension (Expense) Income

Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.

We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points). The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments. The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans’ projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio. The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.

The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan’s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan’s investment holdings, as discussed below.

Pension Plan Assets

The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:



Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities. The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:

Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind. We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment. In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.

Of our

three

significant domestic plans,  the frozen plan (representing approximately

60%

of the total benefit obligation) employs a Liability Driven Investment strategy and has a target allocation of

60%

bonds and

40%

equities. The remaining significant plans have a target allocation of

75%

equities and

25%

bonds, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.

Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to

six

different investments:

four

mutual funds and

two

separate accounts.

The mutual funds, all passively managed low-cost index funds, include:

•

Total Stock Market Index: Large, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.

•

FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world.

•

Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market.

•

Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market.

The separate accounts are invested as follows:

•

Small cap U.S. equities: Portfolio of small capitalization U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2000 Value Index.

•

U.S. equities: Broad portfolio of U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index.

Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

We expect to contribute

$1.5

to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013.

Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:

Other Benefit Plans

Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:



We have limited participation in

two

union-sponsored, defined benefit, multi-employer pension plans.  We participated in one multi-employer plan in 2010 and 2011, and added one additional plan with the Western Pneumatic acquisition in 2012 (as discussed in Note R).

These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provision of negotiated labor contracts.  Aggregate contributions to these plans were less than

$.5

for each of the years presented.

In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if a plan has unfunded vested benefits.  Factors that could impact the funded status of these plans include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.  Withdrawal liability triggers could include a plan's termination, a withdrawal of substantially all employers, or our voluntary withdrawal from the plan (such as decision to close a facility or the dissolution of a collective bargaining unit.) We have a very small share of the liability among the participants of these plans. Based upon the information available from plan administrators, both of the multi-employer plans in which we participate are underfunded and estimate our aggregate share of potential withdrawal liability for both plans to be approximately

$17.0

. We have not recorded any material withdrawal liabilities for the years presented.

N—Income Taxes

The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:

Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:

Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:



In 2012, the tax rate benefited from the elimination of a

$36.9

valuation allowance (

$38.1

in the fourth quarter) on our Canadian net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. As a result of an increase in operating earnings in Canada, the amalgamation of

two

Canadian subsidiaries, and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in Canadian tax law, we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years. We also recorded a

$6.0

deferred tax asset associated with the excess outside tax basis of a subsidiary which is likely to be realized in the foreseeable future. These 2012 benefits were partially offset by the accrual of

$11.2

of deferred withholding taxes in China on earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested in China.

In 2012, 2011, and 2010 the tax rate benefited from income earned in various foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In 2011, the tax rate also benefited by a total of

$5.2

from the release of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax audit settlements. In 2010 and 2011, we incurred

$4.7

and

$1.7

, respectively, of incremental tax on the 2010 repatriation of

$112.6

of earnings from foreign subsidiaries.

We recognized net excess tax benefits of approximately

$5.5

,

$6.1

, and

$.1

in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to stock plan activity, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital. These amounts include net windfall tax benefits as discussed in Note L.

We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so. In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists. After a statute period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period. In addition, we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012, is

$35.5

, of which

$23.4

would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:



We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.

As of December 31, 2012, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2009 through 2012. In 2011, IRS examinations of the 2004 through 2008 tax returns were completed, and in 2012 refunds aggregating

$15.6

were received for all years associated with the audit. In 2011, we adjusted our reserve for uncertain tax positions with respect to the largest issue in connection with the examination, related to worthless stock deductions, which had a favorable impact on our tax provision of

$3.6

.

Additionally, at December 31, 2012, four tax years were undergoing audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2005 through 2008. These examinations are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments. Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years also remain open to examination, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.

It is reasonably possible that resolution of certain tax audits could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, as certain tax positions may be sustained on audit, or we may agree to certain adjustments. It is not expected that any change would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:

The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain. Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance. The large decrease in 2012 primarily stems from the reversal of a valuation allowance in Canada as discussed above.

These loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next


years, but no significant amounts expire in any one year.

Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends. The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits. As of December 31, 2012, we have accrued

$11.2

of deferred taxes associated with the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.



Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested. The cumulative undistributed earnings which are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2012, are approximately

$349.1

. If such earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental tax expense would be approximately

$42.0

based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change. In 2010, we repatriated

$112.6

of foreign earnings, resulting in net tax charges of

$4.7

and

$1.7

in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Although we have not changed our assertion with respect to amounts permanently reinvested outside the U.S., in 2012 we recorded

$11.2

for withholding taxes in China, since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all of our Chinese earnings within China. These taxes would be due on dividends from certain of our China subsidiaries to their foreign parent, a subsidiary of the U.S. company. These earnings are still permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and are included in the undistributed earnings and incremental taxes discussed above.

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

O—Other Expense (Income)

The components of other expense (income) from continuing operations were as follows:

P—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):



Q—Fair Value

We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets for potential impairment as discussed in Note C.

The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.

Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources. The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following tables present assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.



* - Includes both current and long-term amounts combined.

The fair value for fixed rate debt (Level 2) was greater than its

$1,030.0

carrying value by

$45.7

at December 31, 2012 and greater than its

$730.0

carrying value by

$29.2

at December 31, 2011. We value this debt using discounted cash flow and secondary market rates provided by Bloomberg.

R—Acquisitions

The following table contains the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years’ acquisitions. All goodwill included in the table below is expected to provide an income tax benefit.

The following table summarizes acquisitions for the periods presented.

We are finalizing all of the information required to complete the purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications. Preliminary information used in the fair value assessments in these acquisitions is primarily related to certain accruals and contingencies and the tax basis of assets acquired.



On January 12, 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western) for a cash purchase price of

$188

. Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the new Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group. Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included Western's competitive position, and its fit with our strategy to seek businesses with  secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.

The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.  The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2012 and 2011 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  However, Western's activity is incremental to the Industrial Materials segment.

Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash, at a later date and, are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date. At December 31, 2012, there was no substantial remaining consideration payable.

We also increased our ownership portion to

100%

for the following businesses that were previously not wholly owned:

In addition, in the third quarter of 2012, we invested

$22.4

to acquire an interest in an unconsolidated entity related to a potential acquisition. This amount is included in "Sundry" long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet. We have no contractual right or obligation to make any additional investment. At the time of the investment, we secured certain rights that allow us to liquidate our position without loss if we decide to no longer pursue this business as an acquisition.

S—Derivative Financial Instruments

Risk Management Strategy & Objectives

We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities. In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks. We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.

Cash Flow Hedges

Derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:

•

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges

—The commodity cash flow hedges primarily manage natural gas commodity price risk.

•

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

—On August 12, 2012, we issued

$300

of


-year notes with a coupon rate of

3.40%

. As a part of this transaction, we settled our

$200

forward starting interest rate swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of

$42.7

, which will be amortized over the life of the notes.

•

Currency Cash Flow Hedges

—The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies. The currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various foreign currencies.

The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted. Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged. (Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.)

Fair Value Hedges

Our fair value hedges typically manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries’ inter-company assets and liabilities. Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings. Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.



Hedge Effectiveness

We have deemed ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness. If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of operations.

Derivatives Not Qualifying for Hedge Accounting Treatment

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had derivative transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded directly to income and expense in the period impacted, and offset the majority of gains and losses on the underlying hedged item. Our most significant transaction and hedge outstanding at December 31, 2011 was liquidated in the second quarter of 2012.

We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments. The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.





The following table sets forth the pre-tax (gains) losses from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented. This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.

T—Contingencies

We are a defendant in various proceedings involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws. When it is probable, in management's judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings. For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings, and the total liabilities recorded are not material to our financial position.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit

On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC284 (“2010 Suit”). The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 (“2009 Suit”). The 2009 Suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff's failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders. As before, the plaintiff did not make such demand. On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice. On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.  On November 28, 2012, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal, and remanded the case back to the trial court finding that plaintiff sufficiently pled demand on the Board and shareholders. We filed a request for transfer to the Missouri Supreme Court on December 12, 2012, which was denied by the Court of Appeals. On January 3, 2013, we filed a transfer petition to the Missouri Supreme Court. On February 26, 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court denied our request. The case will be sent back to Jasper County, Missouri for further proceedings. The 2010 Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.



The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.

The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants' stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs. The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from us. We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.

We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the 2010 Suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the Court's ruling in the 2009 Suit, this failure to make demand should not be excused; the dismissal of the 2009 Suit precludes the 2010 Suit; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the 2010 Suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant. As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.

We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Antitrust Lawsuits

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over


defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.

A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed, most without prejudice. Of the U.S. cases remaining, we have been named as a defendant in (a)

three

direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) and a consolidated amended class action complaint filed on February 28, 2011 on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products; (b) an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 (although the underlying lawsuits do not name us as a defendant); and an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011; (c)


individual direct purchaser cases, (i) one filed March 22, 2011, (ii) another amended August 24, 2011 to remove class allegations, (iii) one amended August 25, 2011 to name us as a defendant, (iv) three others filed October 31, 2011, (v) one filed November 4, 2011, (vi) three filed December 6, 19 and 30, 2011, respectively, (vii) one filed January 27, 2012, (viii) five filed March 19, 2012, (ix) one amended March 30, 2012 to name us as a defendant, (x) one filed April 27, 2012, (xi)  two filed April 30, 2012, (xii) two filed May 11, 2012, (xiii) one filed May 17, 2012, (xiv) four filed May 25, 2012, (xv) one filed June 12, 2012, (xvi)  four filed August 8, 2012, (xvii) one filed September 21, 2012, (xviii) one filed November 7, 2012 (which suit also makes indirect purchaser claims), and (xix) two filed January 9 and 15, 2013, respectively; and (d) a direct and indirect purchaser class action filed on November 29, 2012 asserting claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. All of the pending U.S. federal cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation

, Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.

In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations. On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim. On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss. Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.

We have been named in

two

Canadian class action cases (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products), both under the name

Hi Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.

in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 (amended November 2, 2011) and CV-11-17279 (issued December 30, 2011). In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over


defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of

$100

, punitive damages of

$10

, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the investigation and the action. We



are not yet required to file our defenses in the Canadian actions.  In addition, on July 10, 2012, plaintiff in a class action case (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products) styled

Option Consommateurs and Karine Robillard v. Produits Vitafoam Canada Limitée, et. al.

in the Quebec Superior Court of Justice (Montréal), Court File No. 500-6-524-104, filed an amended motion for authorization seeking to add us and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products as defendants in this case.

On June 22, 2012, we were also made party to a lawsuit brought in the 16

th

Judicial Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, Case Number 1216-CV15179 under the caption “Dennis Baker, on Behalf of Himself and all Others Similarly Situated vs. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated - Polyurethane Foam Class Action.” The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and/or a class of indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products in the State of Missouri, alleged that we violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act based upon our alleged illegal price inflation of flexible polyurethane foam products. The plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages, punitive damages and the recovery of reasonable attorney fees. We filed a motion to dismiss this action, which was denied on November 5, 2012. Discovery has commenced.

We deny all of the allegations in all of the above actions and will vigorously defend ourselves. These contingencies are subject to many uncertainties. Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any, because, at this juncture of the proceedings, the damages sought by plaintiffs are unspecified, unsupported, and unexplained; discovery is incomplete (no depositions have been taken,  class certification issues are not yet ripe, expert liability reports have not been exchanged); and because the litigation involves unsettled legal theories.

Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters

On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett & Platt do Brasil Ltda. (“L&P Brazil”) in the amount of approximately

$4

, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43. The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L&P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.  L&P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.  On December 17, 2012, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued an additional notice of violation in the amount of approximately

$6.2

under MPF Case No. 0811000.2011.00438 covering the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 on the same subject matter. L&P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 17, 2013 denying the violation.  It is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation for years 2011 and 2012.

In addition, L&P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012 from the Brazilian Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L&P Brazil's use of certain tax credits in the years 2006 through 2010. Such credits are generated based upon the tariff classification and rate used by L&P Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings. Combined with prior assessments, L&P Brazil has received assessments totaling approximately

$2.0

on the same or similar denial of tax credit matters.

L&P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L&P Brazil seeking approximately

$3.3

for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n°.04-256.169/2009). The State of Sao Paulo argued that L&P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo. On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L&P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment. The State filed a special appeal and the Special Appeals court remanded the case back to the Court of Tax and Fees for further findings.  On November 9, 2012, the Court of Tax and Fees again ruled in favor of L&P Brazil and nullified the tax assessment.  On November 28, 2012, the State filed another special appeal. The determination to accept the special appeal was made on December 26, 2012, and L&P responded to this special appeal on January 24, 2013.

We were also informed on October 4, 2012 that the State of Sao Paulo issued an Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine dated May 29, 2012 under Procedure Number 4.003.484 against L&P Brazil in the amount of approximately

$2.3

for the tax years 2009 through 2011. Similar to the prior assessment, the State of Sao Paulo argues that L&P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.

On December 18, 2012, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil  issued a tax assessment to L&P Brazil relating to L&P Brazil's classifications of innersprings for the collection and payment of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings in Minas Gerais from March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012 in the amount of approximately

$.7

, under PTA Case No. 01.000.182756-62.  L&P Brazil filed its response denying any violation on January 17, 2013.



We deny all of the allegations in these actions. We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves. However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties. At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.

Patent Infringement Claim

On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of

$5

based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed

three

patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs. This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive. Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.

On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent's validity and denied that we infringed any patent. At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of

$16.2

.  The court denied plaintiff's attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.

On April 9, 2012 we appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.  Oral argument was held on February 6, 2013 before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C.  On February 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the

$5

verdict against us.  We intend to request a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision.  If a rehearing is not granted, we have the right to request further review to the U.S. Supreme Court.  However, this review is discretionary.

If the case is finally affirmed and remanded to the trial court, the plaintiff might also request royalties for post-verdict use of the machines.  If so, we intend to object to such request.  We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue. The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of

one

of the

three

patents. The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second patent, but subsequently reversed that decision. With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims. All three of these proceedings are currently on appeal before the Board of Patent Appeals.  Due to a change made to all of the machines, we do not believe that the machines currently use the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.

At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
