General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. Our total revenues were

$1,378.5 million

in 2012, compared to $445.8 million in 2011 and $459.1 million in 2010. Our net income was

$750.3 million

, or

$6.75

per diluted share, in 2012, compared to net losses of

$221.8 million

, or $2.45 per share (basic and diluted), in 2011 and

$104.5 million

, or $1.26 per share (basic and diluted), in 2010. Net income in 2012 included an income tax benefit of

$335.8 million

, primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and $75.0 million of substantive milestone payments from our collaborators, as described below under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations."

We currently have three marketed products:

•

EYLEA

®

(aflibercept) Injection, known in the scientific literature as VEGF Trap-Eye, which is available in the United States for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), and in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, and certain other countries for the treatment of wet AMD. We commenced sales of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in November 2011 and for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO in September 2012, following receipt of regulatory approval in the United States. Bayer HealthCare commenced sales of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in the fourth quarter of 2012 following receipt of regulatory approvals in the European Union (EU) and other regions. Bayer HealthCare has additional regulatory applications for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD pending in other countries. In addition, Bayer HealthCare submitted applications for marketing authorization for EYLEA in Europe in December 2012 and in Japan in January 2013 for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO.

We are collaborating with Bayer HealthCare on the global development and commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States. Bayer HealthCare will market EYLEA outside the United States, where, for countries other than Japan, the companies will share equally the profits and losses from sales of EYLEA. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty on sales of EYLEA, as described below. We maintain exclusive rights to EYLEA in the United States and are entitled to all profits from any such sales.



Net product sales of EYLEA in the United States were $

837.9 million

in 2012 and $

24.8 million

in 2011. EYLEA net product sales outside of the United States, which are recorded by Bayer HealthCare, commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012, and were

$19.0 million

for the year.

•

ZALTRAP

®

(ziv-aflibercept) Injection for Intravenous Infusion, known in the scientific literature as VEGF Trap, which is available in the United States for treatment, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan (FOLFIRI), of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. In February 2013, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization in the European Union for ZALTRAP 25mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion in combination with FOLRIRI chemotherapy in adults with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Regulatory applications for marketing authorization of ZALTRAP for the treatment of previously treated mCRC patients in other countries have also been submitted and are currently under review by the respective regulatory agencies.

We and Sanofi globally collaborate on the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP, and share profits and losses from commercialization of ZALTRAP, except for Japan where we are entitled to a royalty on sales of ZALTRAP, as described below. ZALTRAP net product sales, which are recorded by Sanofi, commenced in the United States in August 2012, and totaled $

31.7 million

in 2012.

•

ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) Injection for Subcutaneous Use, which is available in the United States for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), in adults and children 12 and older. CAPS are a group of rare, inherited, auto-inflammatory conditions characterized by life-long, recurrent symptoms of rash, fever/chills, joint pain, eye redness/pain, and fatigue. Intermittent, disruptive exacerbations or flares can be triggered at any time by exposure to cooling temperatures, stress, exercise, or other unknown stimuli.

Net product sales of ARCALYST totaled $

20.2 million

in 2012, $

19.9 million

in 2011, and $

25.3 million

in 2010. Net product sales of ARCALYST in 2010 included $20.5 million of ARCALYST net product sales made in 2010 and $4.8 million of previously deferred net product sales, as described below under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations."

We have 13 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our research laboratories. Our Trap-based clinical programs are:

•

EYLEA, which is in clinical trials for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), and, in Asia, choroidal neovascularization of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia (mCNV), in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare; and

•

ZALTRAP, which is being studied in combination with our angiopoietin-2 inhibitor (REGN910) in oncology in collaboration with Sanofi.

Our antibody-based clinical programs include eleven fully human monoclonal antibodies. The following six are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi:

•

Sarilumab (REGN88), an antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis;

•

REGN727, an antibody to Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is being developed for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction;

•

REGN668, an antibody to the interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R), which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma;

•

REGN421, an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4 (Dll4), a novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology;

•

REGN910, an antibody to angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), another novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology; and

•

REGN1033, an antibody to myostatin (GDF8), which is in clinical development.

In addition, we are developing the following five antibodies independently:

•

REGN1400, an antibody to ErbB3, which is being developed in oncology;

•

REGN846, an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target, which is being developed in atopic dermatitis;

•

REGN1154, an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target;

•

REGN1500, an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target; and

•

REGN475, an antibody to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), which is being developed for the treatment of pain and which is currently on clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).



Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in basic scientific research and discovery-enabling technologies, and to combine that foundation with our clinical development, manufacturing, and commercial capabilities. Our long-term objective is to build a successful, integrated, multi-product biopharmaceutical company that provides patients and medical professionals with innovative options for preventing and treating human diseases.

We believe that our ability to develop product candidates is enhanced by the application of our

VelociSuite

TM

technology platforms. Our discovery platforms are designed to identify specific proteins of therapeutic interest for a particular disease or cell type and validate these targets through high-throughput production of genetically modified mice using our

VelociGene

®

technology to understand the role of these proteins in normal physiology, as well as in models of disease. Our human monoclonal antibody technology (

VelocImmune

®

) and cell line expression technologies (

VelociMab

®

) may then be utilized to discover and produce new product candidates directed against the disease target. Our antibody product candidates currently in clinical trials were developed using

VelocImmune

. Under the terms of our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, which was expanded during 2009, we plan to advance a total of 20 to 30 candidates into clinical development over the life of the agreement. We continue to invest in the development of enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, manufacture, and commercialize new product candidates.

Clinical Programs:

1. EYLEA - Ophthalmologic Diseases

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a naturally occurring protein in the body. Its normal role in a healthy organism is to trigger formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) supporting the growth of the body's tissues and organs. However, in certain diseases, such as wet AMD, it is also associated with the growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye, which exhibit abnormal increased permeability that leads to edema. Scarring and loss of fine-resolution central vision often results. In CRVO and BRVO, a blockage occurs in the main blood vessel that transports deoxygenated blood away from the retina. VEGF levels are elevated in response, contributing to macular edema. For clinically significant DME, VEGF-mediated leakage of fluid from blood vessels in the eye results in interference with vision.

EYLEA is a recombinant fusion protein, consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 and formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. EYLEA acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PlGF) and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. EYLEA is specially purified and contains iso-osmotic buffer concentrations, allowing for injection into the eye.

We, together with our ex-U.S. collaborator Bayer HealthCare, are evaluating EYLEA in Phase 3 programs in patients with DME, macular edema following BRVO, and, in Asia, mCNV of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia. Wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy (which includes DME), and retinal vein occlusion are three of the leading causes of adult blindness in the developed world. In these conditions, severe visual loss is caused by neovascular proliferation and/or retinal edema.

In the second quarter of 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare initiated Phase 3 studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EYLEA in DME. We are conducting one of these studies, VISTA-DME, in the United States. Bayer HealthCare is conducting the second study, VIVID-DME, in Europe, Japan, and Australia. Both the VISTA-DME and VIVID-DME trials are fully enrolled. An additional Phase 3 safety study in Japan (VIVID-Japan) was initiated in the first quarter of 2012 and is required for approval in Japan.

In the first quarter of 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare initiated a Phase 3 trial in Asia in collaboration with the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) investigating the efficacy and safety of EYLEA in patients with mCNV of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia (MYRROR). This study is fully enrolled.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we and Bayer HealthCare initiated a Phase 3 trial in China evaluating the efficacy and safety of EYLEA in wet AMD (SIGHT). The trial is expected to include approximately 300 patients.

In the second quarter of 2012, we initiated a multinational study of EYLEA in patients with macular edema following BRVO (VIBRANT).

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we initiated a study to fulfill a post-marketing requirement by the FDA, RE-VIEW, which will evaluate the effect of EYLEA on corneal endothelium.



2. ZALTRAP (ziv-aflibercept) - Oncology

ZALTRAP is a fusion protein that is designed to bind all forms of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and P1GF, and prevent their interaction with cell surface receptors. VEGF-A (and to a lesser degree, P1GF) is required for the growth of new blood vessels (a process known as angiogenesis) that are needed for tumors to grow.

During the third quarter of 2012, we and Sanofi initiated a Phase 1b study of a combination of ZALTRAP and our angiopoietin-2 inhibitor (REGN910) in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

In April 2012, we and Sanofi announced that the Phase 3 VENICE trial for metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel/prednisone did not meet its primary endpoint.

3. ARCALYST

(rilonacept) - Inflammatory Diseases

ARCALYST is a protein-based product designed to bind the interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we submitted a supplemental BLA (sBLA) for U.S. regulatory approval of ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering therapy. In July 2012, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the sBLA, which stated that the FDA could not approve the application in its current form. The FDA requested additional clinical data, as well as additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) information related to a proposed new dosage form. The FDA's action does not impact the approved indication of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS. We have discontinued development of ARCALYST in gout. We have also withdrawn our approved application for CAPS in the European Union, where we had not previously launched the product.

4. Sarilumab (REGN88; IL-6R Antibody) for inflammatory diseases

IL-6 is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, causing inflammation and joint destruction. A therapeutic antibody to IL-6R, ACTEMRA

®

(tocilizumab), a registered trademark of Chugai Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha, has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Sarilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to IL-6R generated using our

VelocImmune

technology. In July 2011, we and Sanofi announced that in the Phase 2b stage of the SARIL-RA-MOBILITY trial in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients treated with sarilumab in combination with a standard RA treatment, methotrexate (MTX), achieved a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe RA compared to patients treated with MTX alone. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving at least a 20% improvement in RA symptoms (ACR20) after 12 weeks.

During the third quarter of 2011, we and Sanofi initiated the Phase 3 stage of the Phase 2/3 SARIL-RA-MOBILITY study in patients with RA, which is now fully enrolled. This trial will assess the improvement in signs and symptoms at 24 weeks and sarilumab's effect on radiographic progression at one year. In addition, we and Sanofi have initiated a second Phase 3 study, SARIL-RA-TARGET. SARIL-RA-TARGET is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating sarilumab in combination with non-biologic, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in moderate-to-severe active RA patients with inadequate response to, or intolerant of, one or more tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors. Patients who complete SARIL-RA-MOBILITY and SARIL-RA-TARGET are offered enrollment into the ongoing SARIL-RA EXTEND, which is an open-label, long-term safety study of sarilumab. Two additional Phase 3 studies will initiate enrollment in the next few months.

5. REGN727 (PCSK9 Antibody) for LDL cholesterol reduction

Elevated LDL cholesterol (“bad cholesterol”) level is a validated risk factor leading to cardiovascular disease. Statins are a class of drugs that lower LDL through inhibition of HMG-CoA, an enzyme regulating the early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. PCSK9 is a secreted protein that plays a key role in modulating LDL cholesterol levels in the body. PCSK9 binds to and induces the destruction of the LDL receptor, thereby interfering with cellular uptake and increasing circulating levels of LDL cholesterol. In a landmark study published in the

New England Journal of Medicine

in March 2006, patients with lower than normal PCSK9 levels due to a genetic abnormality not only had significantly lower levels of LDL cholesterol, but also a significant reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. We used our

VelocImmune

technology to generate a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of PCSK9, called REGN727, that is intended to lower LDL cholesterol.

REGN727 has been studied in three Phase 2 clinical studies, two in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and one in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH). In the Phase 2 studies, REGN727 significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol from baseline up to 72% on top of standard of care statin therapy. Consistent and robust reductions in other lipid parameters, including a reduction in lipoprotein-a (Lp(a)) were also observed. In the Phase 2 program, injection site reactions were the most common adverse events with REGN727, and were rare. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reaction were also reported.



Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 1.8% of patients (5/275) in the active treatment arms and 2.6% of patients (2/77) in the placebo groups.

Data from the Phase 2 trials of REGN727 were presented during 2012 at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Meeting, the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress (EAS), and the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2012 (AHA). Phase 2 data was also published during 2012 in

The Journal of the American College of Cardiology

and the

New England Journal of Medicine

, as well as online in

The Lancet

.

We and Sanofi initiated the global Phase 3 ODYSSEY program for REGN727 in June 2012. The ODYSSEY program will enroll more than 22,000 patients. This includes over ten clinical trials evaluating the effect of REGN727 on lowering LDL cholesterol. The 18,000 patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, assessing reduction in serious cardiovascular events, and several other trials in the ODYSSEY program, are currently enrolling patients. LDL cholesterol is expected to be the primary efficacy endpoint for initial regulatory filings. The studies will be conducted in clinical centers around the world including the United States, Canada, Western and Eastern Europe, South America, Australia, and Asia. A Phase 3, long-term safety and tolerability study of REGN727 is ongoing in patients with hypercholesterolemia who are not adequately controlled with their current lipid-modifying therapy.

6. REGN668 (IL-4R Antibody) for allergic and immune conditions

IL-4R is required for signaling by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Both of these cytokines are critical mediators of immune response, which, in turn, drives the formation of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and the development of allergic responses, as well as the atopic state that underlies atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma.

REGN668 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our

VelocImmune

technology that is designed to bind to IL-4R. REGN668 demonstrated positive proof of concept in patients with atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma. Data in atopic dermatitis will be presented at the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting in March 2013. Data in allergic asthma will be submitted for presentation at medical conferences later in 2013. We, with our partner Sanofi, plan to initiate Phase 2b studies with REGN668 in asthma and atopic dermatitis in 2013.

7. REGN421 (Dll4 Antibody) for advanced malignancies

In many clinical settings, positively or negatively regulating blood vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits, as could the repair of damaged and leaky vessels. VEGF was the first growth factor shown to be specific for blood vessels, by virtue of having its receptor primarily expressed on blood vessel cells. In the December 21, 2006 issue of the journal

Nature

, we reported data from a preclinical study demonstrating that blocking an important cell signaling molecule, known as Dll4, inhibited the growth of experimental tumors by interfering with their ability to produce a functional blood supply. The inhibition of tumor growth was seen in a variety of tumor types, including those that were resistant to blockade of VEGF, suggesting a novel anti-angiogenesis therapeutic approach. Moreover, inhibition of tumor growth is enhanced by the combination of Dll4 and VEGF blockade in many preclinical tumor models.

REGN421 is a fully human monoclonal antibody to Dll4 generated using our

VelocImmune

technology, and is in Phase 1 clinical development.

8. REGN910 (ANG2 Antibody) for oncology and ophthalmology

The angiopoietins, which were discovered at Regeneron, are ligands for the endothelial cell receptor Tie2 and are essential for vascular development and angiogenesis. Unlike other family members, angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) is strongly upregulated by endothelial cells at sites of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, including tumors.

REGN910 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our

VelocImmune

technology that is designed to block ANG2. REGN910 is in Phase 1 clinical development in oncology. In addition, during the third quarter of 2012, we and Sanofi initiated a Phase 1b study evaluating REGN910 in combination with ZALTRAP in patients with advanced solid malignancies. We also expect REGN910 to enter clinical development in ophthalmology in 2013.

9. REGN1033 (GDF8 Antibody)

In January 2012, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study for REGN1033, a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our

VelocImmune

technology, against myostatin (GDF8).

10. REGN1400 (ErbB3 Antibody) for oncology

REGN1400 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our

VelocImmune

technology, against ErbB3. REGN1400 is in Phase 1 clinical development in oncology.



11. REGN846

REGN846 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our

VelocImmune

technology, against an undisclosed target, and is being evaluated in a Phase 1b study in patients with atopic dermatitis. In July 2011, Sanofi elected not to continue co-development of REGN846, and Regeneron now has sole global rights to REGN846. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi remains obligated to fund agreed-upon REGN846 clinical costs through conclusion of a planned proof of concept trial and is entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of REGN846.

12. REGN1154

REGN1154 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our

VelocImmune

technology, against an undisclosed target. In March 2012, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in Australia. Sanofi decided not to opt-in to the REGN1154 program and we have sole global rights. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi is entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of REGN1154.

13. REGN1500

REGN1500 is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our

VelocImmune

technology, against an undisclosed target. In December 2012, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study. Sanofi decided not to opt-in to the REGN1500 program and we have sole global rights. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi is entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of REGN1500.

14. REGN475 (NGF Antibody) for pain (on clinical hold)

REGN475 is a fully human monoclonal antibody to NGF, generated using our

VelocImmune

technology, which is designed to block pain sensitization in neurons. Preclinical experiments indicate that REGN475 specifically binds to and blocks NGF activity and does not bind to or block cell signaling for the closely related neurotrophins NT-3 and BDNF.

In December 2012, the FDA placed REGN475 and other investigational agents targeting NGF on clinical hold based on preclinical findings with other anti-NGF agents in development. Prior to the FDA clinical hold action, we were planning to initiate late-stage clinical trials with REGN475. There are currently no ongoing trials with REGN475 that are either enrolling or treating patients.

In February 2012, Sanofi elected not to continue co-development of REGN475, and Regeneron now has sole global rights to REGN475. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi was obligated to fund agreed-upon REGN475 development costs through the end of 2012 and is entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of REGN475.

15. REGN728

Development of REGN728, which completed a Phase 1 study against an undisclosed target, was discontinued in 2012.

Collaboration Agreements

Collaborations with Sanofi

ZALTRAP

.

We and Sanofi globally collaborate on the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP. Under the terms of our September 2003 collaboration agreement, as amended, we and Sanofi share co-promotion rights and share profits and losses from commercialization of ZALTRAP outside of Japan. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty of approximately 35% on sales of ZALTRAP, subject to certain potential adjustments. We earned, and recorded as revenue in 2012, a $50.0 million substantive milestone payment from Sanofi upon FDA approval of ZALTRAP. We may also receive additional milestone payments upon receipt of additional specified marketing approvals.

Under the ZALTRAP collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by Sanofi. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi out of our share of ZALTRAP profits (including royalties on sales of ZALTRAP in Japan) for 50% of the development expenses that they funded. The reimbursement payment in any quarter will equal 5% of the then outstanding repayment obligation, but never more than our share of the ZALTRAP profits in the quarter unless we elect to reimburse Sanofi at a faster rate. As a result, we expect that, initially, our share of any ZALTRAP profits will be used to reimburse Sanofi for this repayment obligation.

Antibodies

.

In November 2007, we and Sanofi entered into a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement and a License and Collaboration Agreement. In connection with the execution of the discovery agreement in 2007, we



received a non-refundable, up-front payment of $85.0 million from Sanofi. Pursuant to the collaboration, Sanofi is funding our research to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. We lead the design and conduct of research activities under the collaboration, including target identification and validation, antibody development, research and preclinical activities through filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or its equivalent, toxicology studies, and manufacture of preclinical and clinical supplies.

For each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement, Sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement. If it elects to do so, Sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. Development costs for the drug candidate are shared between the companies, with Sanofi generally funding these costs up front, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate are shared 80% by Sanofi and 20% by us. We are generally responsible for reimbursing Sanofi for half of the total development costs for all collaboration antibody products from our share of profits from commercialization of collaboration products to the extent they are sufficient for this purpose. However, we are not required to apply more than 10% of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing Sanofi for these development costs.

Sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed under the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such products. The parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (Sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (Sanofi)/45% (us), and will share losses outside the United States at 55% (Sanofi)/45% (us). In addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing after aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.

In November 2009, we and Sanofi amended these agreements to expand and extend our antibody collaboration. The goal of the expanded collaboration is to advance a total of 20 to 30 new antibody product candidates into clinical development from 2010 through 2017.

Under the amended discovery agreement, Sanofi agreed to fund up to $160 million per year of our antibody discovery activities over the period from 2010-2017, subject to a one-time option for Sanofi to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing in 2014 if, over the prior two years, certain specified criteria were not satisfied. Sanofi has an option to extend the discovery program for up to an additional three years after 2017 for further antibody development and preclinical activities. Pursuant to the collaboration, Sanofi funded $30 million of agreed-upon costs we incurred to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities.

In 2010, as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities, Sanofi funded $137.7 million of our preclinical research under the expanded collaboration. The balance between that amount and $160 million, or $22.3 million, was added to the funding otherwise available to us in 2011-2012 under the amended discovery agreement.

In August 2008, we entered into an agreement with Sanofi, which extended through December 2012, to use our

VelociGene

platform to supply Sanofi with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and disease. Under this agreement, Sanofi is paying us a total of $21.5 million for the term of the agreement for knock-out and transgenic models of gene function for target genes identified by Sanofi. These models are used by Sanofi for its internal research programs that are outside of the scope of our antibody collaboration.

Collaboration with Bayer HealthCare

In October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare for the global development and commercialization outside the United States of EYLEA. Under the agreement, we and Bayer HealthCare collaborate on, and share the costs of, the development of EYLEA through an integrated global plan. Bayer HealthCare will market EYLEA outside the United States, where, for countries other than Japan, the companies will share equally in profits and losses from sales of EYLEA. In May 2012, Bayer HealthCare's Japanese subsidiary, Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd., and Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. entered into an agreement to co-promote EYLEA in Japan. In conjunction with this agreement, we and Bayer HealthCare amended our existing global license and collaboration agreement for EYLEA to convert the 50/50 profit share for Japan into a royalty agreement under which we are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of between 33.5% and 40.0% of EYLEA annual net sales in Japan. In certain specified circumstances, the Japan royalty may revert to a profit share arrangement.

We earned, and recorded as revenue in 2012, $25.0 million of substantive milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare related to the first marketing and pricing approvals for EYLEA for wet AMD outside the United States. We may also receive up to $25 million in additional milestone payments related to marketing approvals of EYLEA in other indications in major market countries outside the United States, and can earn up to $135 million in sales milestone payments if total annual sales of EYLEA outside the United States achieve certain specified levels starting at $200 million.



Commencing with the first commercial sale of EYLEA in a major market country outside the United States, we became obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare for 50% of the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from our share of the collaboration profits (including royalties on sales of EYLEA in Japan). The reimbursement payment in any quarter will equal 5% of the then outstanding repayment obligation, but never more than our share of the collaboration profits in the quarter unless we elect to reimburse Bayer HealthCare at a faster rate. As a result, we expect that, initially, our share of any EYLEA profits outside the United States will be used to reimburse Bayer HealthCare for this repayment obligation.

Within the United States, we retain exclusive commercialization rights to EYLEA and are entitled to all profits from any such sales.

Research Programs

Our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis, ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases.

Research and Development Technologies

Many proteins that are either on the surface of or secreted by cells play important roles in biology and disease. One way that a cell communicates with other cells is by releasing specific signaling proteins, either locally or into the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct functions and are classified into different “families” of molecules, such as peptide hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. All of these secreted (or signaling) proteins travel to and are recognized by another set of proteins, called “receptors,” which reside on the surface of responding cells. These secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and biological processes, causing diverse effects ranging from the regulation of growth of particular cell types to inflammation mediated by white blood cells. Secreted proteins can at times be overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases. In these disease settings, blocking the action of specific secreted proteins can have clinical benefit. In other cases, proteins on the cell-surface can mediate the interaction between cells, such as the processes that give rise to inflammation and autoimmunity.

Our scientists have developed two different technologies to design protein therapeutics to block the action of specific cell surface or secreted proteins. The first technology, termed the “Trap” technology, was used to generate our three approved products, EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST. These novel “Traps” are composed of fusions between two distinct receptor components and the constant region of an antibody molecule called the “Fc region,” resulting in high affinity product candidates.

VelociSuite

is our second technology platform; it is used for discovering, developing, and producing fully human monoclonal antibodies that can address both secreted and cell-surface targets.

VelociSuite.

VelociSuite

consists of

VelocImmune, VelociGene, VelociMouse

®

, and VelociMab

. The

VelocImmune

mouse platform is utilized to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies.

VelocImmune

was generated by exploiting our

VelociGene

technology (see below), in a process in which six megabases of mouse immune gene loci were replaced, or “humanized,” with corresponding human immune gene loci.

VelocImmune

mice can be used to generate efficiently fully human monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic interest.

VelocImmune

and our entire

VelociSuite

offer the potential to increase the speed and efficiency through which human monoclonal antibody therapeutics may be discovered and validated, thereby improving the overall efficiency of our early stage drug development activities. We are utilizing the

VelocImmune

technology to produce our next generation of drug candidates for preclinical and clinical development.

Our

VelociGene

platform allows custom and precise manipulation of very large sequences of DNA to produce highly customized alterations of a specified target gene, or genes, and accelerates the production of knock-out and transgenic expression models without using either positive/negative selection or isogenic DNA. In producing knock-out models, a color or fluorescent marker may be substituted in place of the actual gene sequence, allowing for high-resolution visualization of precisely where the gene is active in the body during normal body functioning as well as in disease processes. For the optimization of preclinical development and pharmacology programs,

VelociGene

offers the opportunity to humanize targets by replacing the mouse gene with the human homolog. Thus,

VelociGene

allows scientists to rapidly identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or over-expressing the target gene, as well as to characterize and test potential therapeutic molecules.

Our

VelociMouse

technology platform allows for the direct and immediate generation of genetically altered mice from embryonic stem cells (ES cells), thereby avoiding the lengthy process involved in generating and breeding knockout mice from chimeras. Mice generated through this method are normal and healthy and exhibit a 100% germ-line transmission. Furthermore, mice developed using our

VelociMouse

technology are suitable for direct phenotyping or other studies. We have also developed our

VelociMab

platform for the rapid screening of antibodies and rapid generation of expression cell lines for our Traps and our

VelocImmune

human monoclonal antibodies.



Manufacturing

Our manufacturing facilities are located in Rensselaer, New York and currently consist of three buildings totaling approximately 395,000 square feet of research, manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. In addition, we have recently commenced construction of approximately 93,000 square feet of additional manufacturing and office space at our Rensselaer site. We currently have approximately 54,000 liters of cell culture capacity at these facilities, and will add 20,000 liters of cell culture capacity once construction of our additional space is completed by 2015. At December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 550 people at our Rensselaer facilities. We also depend on a limited number of third party providers for other services with respect to our clinical and commercial product supply requirements, including product packaging, filling, and labeling.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a medicine is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer's quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations of the health authority. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other national, federal, state, and local agencies. We are approved to manufacture our marketed products at our Rensselaer facilities.

Sales and Marketing

We have a New Products Marketing and Planning group and a Market Research group to evaluate commercial opportunities for our targets and drug candidates, assess the competitive environment, and analyze the commercial potential of our product portfolio, and prepare for market launch of new products. This group works in close collaboration with our collaborators for co-developed products to develop marketing plans and forecasts and to develop and execute pre-launch market development programs.

In preparation for the launch of EYLEA for wet AMD in 2011, we hired and trained a full-service commercialization group to execute the launch of EYLEA. The group includes experienced professionals in the fields of marketing, communications, professional education, patient education and advocacy, reimbursement and managed markets, trade and distribution, commercial operations, commercial analytics, market research, and forecasting. Moreover, we have hired, trained, and deployed a field-based organization of approximately 75 individuals, including regional sales directors, medical sales specialists, and reimbursement managers, each typically with 7 or more years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry in a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology, ophthalmology, immunology, and inflammation. We outsource the warehousing and distribution of our finished drug products.

In connection with the sales and marketing of ARCALYST for CAPS, we have a small marketing, trade, reimbursement, and distribution group to provide case management and reimbursement services to patients with CAPS and their treating physicians.

Competition

We face substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and chemical companies (see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of EYLEA for the Treatment of Wet AMD and Risks Related to Commercialization of Products”). Our competitors include Genentech (a member of the Roche group), Roche, Novartis, Pfizer Inc., Bayer HealthCare, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Abbott Laboratories, Sanofi, Merck & Co., Inc., Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, and others. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research, preclinical, and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. Competition from smaller competitors may also be or become more significant if those competitors acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even if we are able to commercialize additional product candidates, one or more of our competitors may have brought a competitive product to market earlier than us or may have obtained or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our activities or products. Our ability to compete will depend, to a great extent, on how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market. Competition among product candidates approved for sale will also be based on efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other factors.

EYLEA.

The market for eye disease products is very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody fragment (Lucentis

®

) for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, RVO, and other eye indications. Lucentis

®

was approved by the FDA in June 2006 for the treatment of wet AMD, in June 2010 for the treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and in August 2012 for the treatment of DME. Lucentis

®

was approved by the EMA for wet AMD in January 2007, for the treatment of DME in January 2011, and for the treatment of RVO in June 2011. Many other companies, including Genentech, are working on the development of product candidates and



extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of wet AMD, DME, and RVO including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors, as well as use of small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene expression. For example, in January, 2012, Genentech submitted an IND for an extended delivery device. Ophthotech Corporation is developing Fovista

™

, an aptamer directed against platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGF-B), as a product candidate intended to be used in combination with an anti-VEGF therapy in wet AMD. In June 2012, Ophthotech announced results of a Phase 2b study in wet AMD that it claimed demonstrated that Fovista

™

administered in combination with Lucentis

®

resulted in increased visual outcomes compared to Lucentis

®

monotherapy. Allergan is developing an anti-VEGF-A  DARPin

®

, as well as a dual anti-VEGF-A/PDGF-B DARPin

®

, and its corresponding backups for the treatment of wet AMD and related conditions. Allergan has announced that it expects Phase 2 data in wet AMD from its anti-VEGF-A DARPin

®

in 2013.

In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label, with success for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, and RVO, a third-party repackaged version of Genentech's approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

(bevacizumab). The relatively low cost of therapy with Avastin

®

in patients with wet AMD presents a significant competitive challenge in this indication. Long-term, controlled clinical trials comparing Lucentis

®

to Avastin

®

in the treatment of wet AMD are being conducted. One-year data from the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) were reported in April 2011 and indicated that Avastin

®

dosed monthly was non-inferior to Lucentis

®

dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean visual acuity gain at 52 weeks. Avastin

®

is also being evaluated in eye diseases in trials that have been initiated in the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Israel, and other areas. It may be difficult for EYLEA

to compete in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved against Lucentis

®

and off-label use of Avastin

®

because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these medicines and because of the relatively low cost of Avastin

®

. Moreover, the reported results of the CATT study, combined with the relatively low cost of Avastin

®

in treating patients with wet AMD, may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which EYLEA will face in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved. In addition, while we believe that ZALTRAP would not be well tolerated if administered directly to the eye, there is a risk that third parties will attempt to repackage ZALTRAP for off-label use and sale for the treatment of wet AMD and other diseases of the eye, which would present a potential low-cost competitive threat to EYLEA for wet AMD or other eye indications.

ZALTRAP.

Many companies are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block the actions of VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A variety of approaches have been employed, including antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF receptor, small molecule antagonists to the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, and other anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of these alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to aflibercept in efficacy, side-effect profile, durability of effect, or method of delivery. Additionally, some of these molecules are already approved for marketing and have a broader range of indications than our product candidate.

In particular, Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

, on the market for treating certain cancers and a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, Amgen, Imclone LLC/Eli Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Aveo. Some of these molecules may offer competitive advantages over our molecule.

Pfizer, Onyx (together with its partner Bayer HealthCare), GlaxoSmithKline, and Bayer HealthCare are selling and marketing oral medications that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth of tumors.

ARCALYST.

In 2009, Novartis received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for canakinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) antibody, for the treatment of CAPS. In January 2011, Novartis announced that it had submitted an application to the EMA for approval of canakinumab in the treatment of gout flares. Novartis submitted a supplemental BLA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2011 for approval of canakinumab in gout, which was denied in August 2011 based upon safety concerns. Canakinumab is also in development for atherosclerosis and a number of other inflammatory diseases. In addition, there are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other third parties that are designed to block the synthesis of IL-1 or inhibit the signaling of IL-1. For example, Xoma Ltd., in collaboration with Servier, is developing an antibody to IL-1, and Amgen, MedImmune, and XBiotech are developing antibodies to the IL-1 receptor. These drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over ARCALYST. The successful development and/or commercialization of these competing molecules could adversely affect sales of ARCALYST for CAPS.

Monoclonal Antibodies.

Our clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies which were generated using our

VelocImmune

technology. Our antibody generation technologies and clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies.

Numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products. Companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Biogen Idec, Inc., Novartis, Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squib, AbbVie, and GlaxoSmithKline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in development or on the market that are derived from recombinant DNA that comprise



human antibody sequences. Astellas has licensed our

VelocImmune

technology as part of their internal antibody development programs.

We are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against targets that are also the targets of our product candidates. For example, Amgen, Pfizer, Genentech, Santaris, and Eli Lilly have development programs for antibodies against PCSK9; Alnylam, in partnership with The Medicines Company, has a clinical program underway with an RNAi molecule against PCSK9. GlaxoSmithKline, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Genentech have development programs for antibodies against IL-4R, IL-4, or IL-13 for the treatment of asthma. Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Abbvie are developing antibody product candidates against NGF. Genentech is marketing an antibody against IL-6R (tocilizumab) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and several other companies, including Centocor Ortho Biotech, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, have antibodies against IL-6 in clinical development for this disease. Aerovance has completed initial clinical trials of two formulations of a biologic directed against IL-4. Amgen previously had an antibody against IL-4R in clinical development for the treatment of asthma. Amgen, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca have development programs underway for antibodies against ANG2. GlaxoSmithKline, in partnership with OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., has a Dll4 antibody in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors.

Other Areas.

Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to discover new therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time and resources. In these and related areas, intellectual property rights have been sought and certain rights have been granted to competitors and potential competitors of ours, and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic competitors are involved in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that are the focus of other research or development programs we are now conducting. Many firms and entities are engaged in research and development in the areas of cytokines, interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle conditions. Some of these competitors are currently conducting advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these areas. These and other competitors may have established substantial intellectual property and other competitive advantages.

If any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product, such developments may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, or future prospects.

We also compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public or private research organizations, which conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of products that would provide royalties or other consideration for use of their technology. These institutions are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties or other consideration for use of the technology they have developed. Products developed in this manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also compete with others in acquiring technology from these institutions, agencies, and organizations.

Patents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties (see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity -

We may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed, third-party patents or other proprietary rights, and the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely continue to be significant.”

). Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements that we consider important to our business and operations. As of December 31, 2012, we held an ownership interest in a total of approximately 185 issued patents in the United States and approximately 777 issued patents in foreign countries with respect to our products and technologies. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in hundreds of patent applications in the United States and foreign countries.

Our patent portfolio includes granted patents and pending patent applications covering our

VelociSuite

technologies, including our

VelocImmune

mouse platform which produces fully human monoclonal antibodies. Our issued patents covering these technologies generally expire between 2020 and 2028. However, we continue to file patent applications directed to improvements to these technology platforms.

Our patent portfolio also includes issued patents and pending applications relating to our marketed products,  EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST, and our product candidates in clinical development. These patents cover the proteins and DNA encoding the proteins, manufacturing patents, method of use patents, and pharmaceutical compositions, as well as various methods of using the products. For each of EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST, these patents generally expire between 2020 and 2028.



However, the projected patent terms may be subject to extension based on potential patent term extensions in countries where such extensions are available.

We also are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of additional patents and patent applications. In December 2011, we and Genentech entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States. Pursuant to this agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to certain patents relating to VEGF receptor proteins, known as the Davis-Smyth patents, and other technology patents.

In July 2008 we entered into an Amended and Restated Non-Exclusive License Agreement with Cellectis S.A. pursuant to which we licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to a process for the specific replacement of a copy of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous recombination.

We also have non-exclusive license agreements with Amgen and other organizations for patent rights related to ARCALYST.

Patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products in the United States and other important commercial markets is uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts, and governments in these countries. There is no certainty that our existing patents or others, if obtained, will provide us protection from competition or provide commercial benefit.

Others may independently develop similar products or processes to those developed by us, duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are issued to us, design around any products and processes covered by our patents. We expect to continue, when appropriate, to file product and process applications with respect to our inventions. However, we may not file any such applications or, if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights is expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties (see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity -

We may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed, third-party patents or other proprietary rights, and the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely continue to be significant.

”).

Government Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of EYLEA, ZALTRAP, ARCALYST, and our product candidates (see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of EYLEA for Wet AMD -

Our regulatory approval for sales of EYLEA is limited to the treatment of wet AMD and is limited to sales in the United States. If we don't receive approval for EYLEA for other indications, or if approvals are not obtained for sales in other countries, our sales and profits will be limited

and Risks Related to the Development and Approval of Our Product Candidates and New Indications for Our Marketed Products -

If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products and product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, we will not be able to market or sell them, which would materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.”)

. All of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a number of jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted.

The activities required before a product candidate may be marketed in the United States begin with preclinical tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate and its formulations. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must be reviewed by the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In Phase 1, trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of different potential doses of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as required by the FDA. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product candidate are



then submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application.

Any approval required by the FDA for any of our product candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in humans.

Approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required for FDA approval.

Various federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the research, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport, and other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and future business will be subject to regulation under the United States Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions, and other current and potential future local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Business Segments

We manage our business as one segment which includes all activities related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions and the development and commercialization of these discoveries. This segment includes revenues and expenses related to (i) product sales of EYLEA and ARCALYST, (ii) research and development activities conducted under our collaboration agreements with third parties, (iii) our share of the income (loss) from commercialization of products under our collaboration agreements, (iv) licensing agreements to utilize our

VelocImmune

technology, and (v) the supply of specified, ordered research materials using our

VelociGen

e technology platform.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 1,950 full-time employees, of whom approximately 360 held a Ph.D. and/or M.D., or PharmD degree. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel in a highly competitive environment; however, competition for these personnel is intense. None of our personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and our management considers its relations with our employees to be good.

Available Information

We make available free of charge on or through our Internet website

(http://www.regeneron.com) our An

nual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

We operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties. We caution you to read the following risk factors, which have affected, and/or in the future could affect, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. The risks described below include forward-looking statements, and actual events and our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties are described under other captions in this report and should also be considered by our investors.



Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Additional Financing

We have a history of operating losses and have only recently achieved profitability. If we cannot sustain profitability, our business, prospects, and financial condition would be materially harmed.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we reported profitability; prior to that, we generally incurred net losses. From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31, 2012, we had a cumulative loss of

$517.1 million

. If we cannot sustain profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations. In the absence of substantial revenue from the sale of products on an ongoing basis, including our current sales of EYLEA and ARCALYST, and our share of the profits from Sanofi's sales of ZALTRAP and Bayer HealthCare's sales of EYLEA outside the United States, or from other sources, the amount, timing, nature or source of which cannot be predicted, we may incur substantial losses again as we conduct our research and development activities, commercialize our approved products, and prepare for possible commercialization of our other product candidates and new indications of our marketed products.

We may need additional funding in the future, which may not be available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.

We will need to expend substantial resources for research and development, including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products, the commercialization of products, and capital expenditures. We believe our existing capital resources, together with funds generated by current and anticipated EYLEA net product sales and funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for the foreseeable future; however, one or more of our collaboration agreements may terminate, our revenues may fall short of our projections or be delayed, or our expenses may increase, any of which could result in our capital being consumed significantly faster than anticipated. In addition, our expenses may increase for many reasons, including expenses in connection with the ongoing launch and marketing of EYLEA and the potential commercial launches of our late-stage product candidates and new indications for our marketed products, manufacturing scale-up, expenses related to clinical trials testing EYLEA, REGN475, REGN846, REGN1154, REGN1400, or REGN1500, and expenses related to the potential requirement for us to fund 20% of Phase 3 clinical trial costs for any of our antibody product candidates being developed in collaboration with Sanofi.

We cannot be certain that our existing capital resources and our current and anticipated revenues will be sufficient to meet our operating needs. We may require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise additional funds. If additional financing is necessary and we are able to obtain it through the sale of equity securities, such sales will likely be dilutive to our shareholders. Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may be at interest rates and contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders. Should we require and be unable to raise sufficient funds (i) to complete the development of our product candidates, (ii) to successfully commercialize our late-stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products if they obtain regulatory approval, and (iii) to continue our manufacturing and marketing of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, we may face delay, reduction, or elimination of our research and development or preclinical or clinical programs and our commercialization activities, which would significantly limit our potential to generate revenue.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Our revenue from outside of the United States will increase as our products, whether marketed by us or our collaborators, gain marketing approval in such jurisdictions. If the U.S. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact on net income, but our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact. Likewise, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact on net income, but our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact. Therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our operating results and the financial condition of our company.



Risks Related to Commercialization of EYLEA

We are substantially dependent on the success of EYLEA. If we are unable to continue to commercialize EYLEA or if we are unable to obtain additional marketing approvals, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition will be materially harmed.

EYLEA net sales make up a substantial portion of our revenues and this concentration of our net sales in a single product makes us substantially dependent

on that product. If we were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of EYLEA in the United States, if Bayer Healthcare were to experience any difficulty with the commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States, or if we and Bayer Healthcare are unable to maintain current marketing approvals of EYLEA, we may experience a reduction in revenue and may not be able to sustain profitability, and our operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed.  In addition, if we are unable to obtain approval of EYLEA in the United States for the treatment of DME and macular edema following BRVO, or if Bayer Healthcare is unable to obtain approval of EYLEA in additional countries or in additional indications, our prospects would be materially harmed.

We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to EYLEA. If we fail to maintain regulatory compliance for EYLEA, we may lose marketing approval, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

EYLEA is currently approved for treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO in the United States. Outside the United States, EYLEA is currently approved for the treatment of wet AMD in the European Union, Switzerland, Australia, Colombia, Japan, Brazil, and Chile, and Bayer HealthCare is seeking approval in other countries. We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations with respect to EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO in the United States, and, outside the United States, the commercialization of EYLEA is subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight in those countries where the product is approved. If we fail to maintain regulatory compliance for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, we may lose marketing approval, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. Failure to comply may also subject us to sanctions, product recalls, or withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications. See also “

If we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates, we could incur substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch if they obtain regulatory approval, and a reduction in sales.”

Serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of EYLEA could materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

There are risks inherent in intravitreal injections, including with EYLEA, such as intraocular inflammation, sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis, corneal decomposition, retinal detachment, retinal tear, and other side effects, all of which are reported from time to time to the FDA. Serious complications or serious, unexpected side effects in connection with the use of EYLEA could materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

Our regulatory approval for sales of EYLEA is limited to the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO and is limited geographically. If we don't receive approval for EYLEA for other indications, or if approvals are not obtained for sales in other countries, sales and profits will be limited.

We have received regulatory approval for sale of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO only in the United States and for the treatment of wet AMD in the European Union, Switzerland, Australia, Colombia, Japan, Brazil and Chile. If we do not receive approval for EYLEA for other uses, or if approvals for sales in other countries are not obtained, sales will be limited and our potential for profits will be limited. As a result, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially impacted.



Our sales of EYLEA are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payers, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our sales and revenue and harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

Our current sales in the United States of EYLEA are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including private payer healthcare and insurance programs and government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If approved for sale in other countries, such sales will be dependent, in part, on similar programs in these countries. In the United States, there is an increased focus from the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs, including limiting federal healthcare expenditures. Economic pressure on state budgets may also have a similar impact. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from U.S. government programs could have a material adverse effect on the sales of EYLEA. Since EYLEA is too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, is not available, our ability to successfully commercialize EYLEA will be materially adversely impacted. Our sales and potential profits and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed. See also "

The successful commercialization of our marketed products as well as our late-stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if approved, will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and these payers may not agree to cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that make our products uncompetitive and/or unprofitable, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition

."

The commercial success of EYLEA currently being marketed for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO is subject to strong competition.

The market for eye disease products is very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody fragment, Lucentis

®

for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following CRVO, DME, and other eye indications. Lucentis

®

was approved by the FDA in June 2006 for the treatment of wet AMD and in June 2010 for the treatment of macular edema following RVO, CRVO, and BRVO. Lucentis

®

was also approved by the EMA for wet AMD in January 2007 and for DME in January 2011. Many other companies are working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of wet AMD, DME and RVO including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors, as well as small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene expression. For example, in January 2012, Genentech submitted an IND for such an extended delivery device.  Ophthotech Corporation is developing Fovista

™

, an aptamer directed against platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGF-B), as a product candidate intended to be used in combination with an anti-VEGF therapy in wet AMD. In June 2012, Ophthotech announced results of a Phase 2b study in wet AMD that it claimed demonstrated that Fovista

™

administered in combination with Lucentis

®

resulted in increased visual outcomes compared to Lucentis

®

monotherapy. Allergan is developing an anti-VEGF-A DARPin

®

, as well as a dual anti-VEGF-A/PDGF-B DARPin

®

, and its corresponding backups for the treatment of wet AMD and related conditions.

In addition, ophthalmologists are using with success off-label, third-party repackaged versions of Genentech's approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

, for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, and RVO. The relatively low cost of therapy with Avastin

®

in patients with wet AMD presents a significant competitive challenge in this indication. Long-term, controlled clinical trials comparing Lucentis

®

to Avastin

®

in the treatment of wet AMD are being conducted. One-year data from the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) were reported in April 2011 and indicated that Avastin

®

dosed monthly was non-inferior to Lucentis

®

dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean visual acuity gain at 52 weeks. Two-year data from CATT were reported in April 2012 and indicated that monthly Avastin

®

was non-inferior to monthly Lucentis

®

in mean visual acuity gain; as-needed dosing was

not

non-inferior to monthly dosing. Avastin

®

is also being evaluated in eye diseases in trials that have been initiated in the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Israel, and other countries. Furthermore, Lucentis

®

and off-label use of Avastin

®

, present significant competitive challenges as doctors and patients have had significant experience using these medicines. Moreover, the reported results of the CATT study, combined with the relatively low cost of Avastin

®

in treating patients with wet AMD, may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which EYLEA faces in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved. Finally, ZALTRAP has not been manufactured and formulated for use in intravitreal injections, and while we believe that ZALTRAP would not be well tolerated if administered directly to the eye, there is a risk that third parties may attempt to repackage ZALTRAP for off-label use and sale for the treatment of wet AMD and other diseases of the eye, which would present a potential low-cost competitive threat to EYLEA for wet AMD, macular edema following CRVO, or other eye indications. See also “

We may be unsuccessful in continuing the commercialization of our marketed products or in commercializing our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if approved, which would materially and adversely affect our business, profitability, and future prospects.

”



Our product sales could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.

Our sales of products in the United States may be reduced if our products are imported into the United States from lower priced markets, whether legally or illegally. Under our arrangement with Bayer HealthCare, pricing and reimbursement for EYLEA outside the United States is the responsibility of Bayer HealthCare. Prices for EYLEA in territories outside the United States will be based on local market economics and competition and are likely to differ from country to country. In the United States, prices for pharmaceuticals are generally higher than in the bordering nations of Canada and Mexico and our sales of EYLEA in the United States may be reduced if EYLEA is marketed in those nations and imported into the United States.  In addition, there have been proposals to legalize the import of pharmaceuticals from outside the United States.  If such legislation were enacted, our future revenues could be reduced.

Risks Related to the Development and Approval of Our Product Candidates and New Indications for Our Marketed Products

If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products and product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, we will not be able to market or sell them, which would materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

We cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval. If we do not maintain regulatory approval for our products EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST, and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or new indications of our marketed products, including EYLEA for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases other than wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, the value of our company, our operating results, and our prospects will be materially harmed. Our product candidates, including EYLEA for DME and macular edema following BRVO, may not receive regulatory approval. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for EYLEA in DME and macular edema following BRVO, or if we are materially delayed in doing so, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition will be materially harmed. In addition, if we fail to maintain regulatory approval for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, we may lose marketing approval and the ability to generate EYLEA product sales revenue, which would materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for drug products is costly, time-consuming, and highly uncertain.

In the United States, we must obtain and maintain approval from the FDA for each drug we intend to sell. Obtaining FDA approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain. Foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain.

The FDA enforces Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) and other regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical research organizations (CROs), principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of the third parties conducting our clinical studies are determined to have failed to fully comply with GCPs, the study protocol or applicable regulations, the clinical data generated in those studies may be deemed unreliable. This could result in non-approval of our product candidates by the FDA, or we or the FDA may decide to conduct additional audits or require additional clinical studies, which would delay our development programs, require us to incur additional costs, and could substantially harm our business.

Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured or advanced through the supply chain be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and regulations governing the manufacture, shipment and storage of the product. Manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our products must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any of our product collaborators, or third-party manufacturers, product packagers, labelers, or other parties performing steps in the supply chain are unable to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.

In addition to the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and approval of drugs, and commercial sale and distribution of drugs in foreign countries. The foreign regulatory approval process and requirements include all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as country specific regulations, and actions by a regulatory agency in a country or region with respect to a product candidate may have an impact on the approval process for that product candidate in another country or region. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product in the United States, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can conduct clinical trials of or market that product or any other product in those countries.



Preclinical and clinical studies required for our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. If any such studies are delayed or yield unfavorable results, regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications of our marketed products may be delayed or become unobtainable.

As described above, we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them. We need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human clinical trials. Conducting such studies is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including, among others, failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious or life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in a clinical trial, lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator drug, and the failure of clinical investigators, trial monitors, contractors, consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan, protocol, or applicable regulations related to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) or GCPs. A clinical trial may fail because it did not include and retain a sufficient number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance. A clinical trial may also fail because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting.

We will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either conduct new studies, which are expensive and time consuming, or abandon that drug development program. If preclinical testing yields unfavorable results, product candidates may not advance to clinical trials.  The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our clinical candidates for the desired indication(s) would preclude the successful development of those candidates for such indication(s), in which event our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.

Successful development of our current and future product candidates is uncertain.

Only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We are testing EYLEA in late-stage clinical trials in additional indications. Clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for these product candidates in these indications. In a number of instances, we have terminated the development of product candidates due to a lack of or only modest effectiveness. Moreover, even if we obtain positive results from preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results have been obtained in earlier trials.

In April 2011, we announced that our Phase 3 VELOUR trial of ZALTRAP met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in the treatment of patients with previously treated mCRC. Based upon these positive results, we and Sanofi submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval to the FDA and EMA, and, in August 2012, the FDA approved ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen for patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. However, in April 2011, we and Sanofi also announced the results from another randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (VENICE) that evaluated ZALTRAP as a first-line treatment for metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel/prednisone. The VENICE trial did not meet the pre-specified criterion of improvement in overall survival.

In January 2012, Roche announced that a Phase 3 trial of Avastin

®

(bevacizumab) had met the primary endpoint of overall survival in mCRC in patients who had previously received Avastin

®

with standard chemotherapy. The positive results of this trial in a similar patient population could impact the potential commercial opportunity for ZALTRAP in mCRC.

We also reported positive results of a Phase 2 trial of EYLEA for the treatment of DME and in the second quarter of 2011 initiated a Phase 3 program in that indication. A number of other potential new drugs and biologics which showed promising results in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, and this could occur with respect to subsequent clinical trials of EYLEA for the treatment of DME.

Based on the results of three Phase 3 studies, we submitted a supplemental BLA filing to the FDA seeking approval of ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering drug therapy. In May 2012, the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA voted to recommend against approval of ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering drug therapy and, in July 2012, we received a Complete Response letter from the FDA requesting additional information, including clinical data, as well as additional CMC information related to a proposed new dosage form. We have discontinued development of ARCALYST for gout.

Many of our clinical trials are conducted under the oversight of Independent Data Monitoring Committees (IDMCs). These independent oversight bodies are made up of external experts who review the progress of ongoing clinical trials, including available safety and efficacy data, and make recommendations concerning a trial's continuation, modification, or termination based on interim, unblinded data. Any of our ongoing clinical trials may be discontinued or amended in response to recommendations made



by responsible IDMCs based on their review of such interim trial results. For example, in September 2009, a Phase 3 trial that was evaluating ZALTRAP as a first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine was discontinued at the recommendation of an IDMC after a planned analysis of interim efficacy data determined that the trial would not meet its efficacy endpoint. The recommended termination of any of our ongoing late-stage clinical trials by an IDMC could negatively impact the future development of our product candidate(s), and our business may be materially harmed.

We are studying our antibody candidates in a wide variety of indications in clinical trials. Many of these trials are exploratory studies designed to evaluate the safety profile of these compounds and to identify what diseases and uses, if any, are best suited for these product candidates. These product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and/or safety profile to support continued development for some or all of the indications that are being, or are planned to be, studied, which would diminish our clinical “pipeline” and could negatively affect our future prospects and the value of our company.

Serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of our products and in clinical trials for our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, which could severely harm our business.

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products. It is possible that as we test our drug candidates or new indications in larger, longer, and more extensive clinical programs, or as use of these drugs becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products has many side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or if the product candidate has received regulatory approval such approval may be revoked, which would severely harm our business.

EYLEA is being studied in diseases of the eye in addition to wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO. There are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of VEGF that may limit our ability to successfully develop and/or commercialize ZALTRAP and EYLEA. These serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on clinical and preclinical experience of VEGF inhibitors, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension, proteinuria, congestive heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. In addition, patients given infusions of any protein, including ZALTRAP delivered through intravenous administration, may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF blockers have reported side effects that became evident only after large scale trials or after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated. There are risks inherent in the intravitreal administration of drugs like EYLEA, which can cause injury to the eye and other complications. For example, in our Phase 3 trials of EYLEA in wet AMD, the most frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage, macular degeneration, eye pain, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. These and other complications or side effects could harm the development and/or commercialization of ZALTRAP for the treatment of mCRC or EYLEA for the treatment of diseases of the eye.

We are studying REGN475, a fully human monoclonal antibody to NGF, in a variety of pain indications, including osteoarthritis of the knee. In December 2010, the FDA placed REGN475 and other investigational agents targeting NGF on clinical hold after a case of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis leading to joint replacement was seen in another company's anti-NGF program. At that time, the FDA expressed concern that this case, which followed previously-reported cases of joint replacements in patients on an anti-NGF drug candidate being developed by a different pharmaceutical company, provided evidence to suggest a class effect. An FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee met on March 12, 2012 to discuss possible safety issues related to anti-NGF compounds and voted unanimously in favor of a role for the ongoing development of anti-NGF agents in osteoarthritis. The Arthritis Advisory Committee also voted twenty to one in favor of a role for development of anti-NGF agents to manage the pain associated with conditions for which there are no agents with demonstrated analgesic efficacy. In December 2012, the FDA removed the clinical hold on REGN475 after reviewing our proposed Phase 3 program in osteoarthritis. However, shortly thereafter, the entire class was again placed on clinical hold as a result of preclinical data from other investigational agents targeting NGF in development.There are currently no trials with REGN475 that are either enrolling or treating patients. Discussions with the FDA about REGN475 are ongoing.



Our product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that could cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic protein.

In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. The antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react with the patient's own proteins, resulting in an “auto-immune” type disease. Whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments, and their detection or appearance is often delayed, so neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date, in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed.

We may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use, which would delay or prevent continued development of such candidates and/or receipt of regulatory approval or commercial sale, which could materially harm our business.

If we are unable to continue to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product candidates, including our antibody candidates, we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials, which would delay or prevent the development of our product candidates. Similarly, if we are unable, directly or through our collaborators or third parties, to supply sufficient quantities of our products or develop formulations of our product candidates suitable for commercial use, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for those product candidates.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity

If we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will be harmed.

Our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other information that we protect as trade secrets. We seek to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements. If our trade secrets are improperly disclosed, by our own employees, our collaborators or otherwise, it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. The patent position of biotechnology companies, including our company, involves complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Patent applications filed outside the United States may be challenged by third parties who file an opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the European Union and are costly to defend. We have pending patent applications in the European Patent Office and it is likely that we will need to defend patent applications from third-party challengers from time to time in the future. Certain patent applications filed in the United States may also be challenged by third parties who file a request for post-grant review under the America Invents Act of 2011, beginning on September 16, 2012. We expect that post-grant review proceedings will become common in the United States and will be costly to defend. We have pending patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and it is likely that we will need to defend patent applications from third-party challengers from time to time in the future. Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors. Furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to us, the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time consuming.

We may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed, third-party patents or other proprietary rights, and the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely continue to be significant.

Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to our products in clinical development or even to products that have received regulatory approval and are being or have been commercialized, either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition of a product or the way it is manufactured or used. Moreover, other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to antibody products made using our

VelocImmune

technology, either because of the way the antibodies are discovered or produced or because of a proprietary composition covering an antibody or the antibody's target.

We are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptors. We do not believe that ZALTRAP or EYLEA infringe any valid claim in these patents or patent applications. We are involved in five patent litigations with Genentech, two in the United States and three in Europe. In November 2010, we commenced a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court), seeking a declaratory judgment that no activities relating to our VEGF Trap infringe any valid claim of certain Genentech patents referred to as the Davis-Smyth patents (the First Davis-Smyth Case). Genentech answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims that our prior or planned activities relating to VEGF Trap have infringed or will infringe claims of four of the Davis-Smyth patents and requested a judgment against us for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate.



On December 31, 2011, we entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States (Genentech Agreement) that covers making, using, and selling EYLEA in the United States for the prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States, and ends the litigation relating to those matters. Under the Genentech Agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth patents, and certain other technology patents owned or co-owned by Genentech. The Genentech Agreement does not cover any non-U.S. patent rights or non-U.S. patent disputes, and does not cover any use of aflibercept other than for prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States. The First Davis-Smyth Case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the Genentech Agreement. The Genentech Agreement provides for us to make payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA through May 7, 2016, the date the Davis-Smyth patents expire. As required by the Genentech Agreement, in the third quarter of 2012, we made a lump-sum payment of $60.0 million when cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA reached $400 million. We will also pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA over $3 billion. As a result of the Genentech Agreement, on January 17, 2012, Genentech filed a second amended answer and counterclaim in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in which it amended its counterclaims alleging infringement of four of the  Davis-Smyth patents. On December 23, 2011, Genentech initiated a related case in the Court against Regeneron and Sanofi alleging infringement of four of the Davis-Smyth Patents by activities relating to VEGF Trap (but excluding EYLEA) (the Second Davis-Smyth Case). As in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in the new complaint Genentech requests a judgment against us for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate. On September 21, 2012, Genentech asserted two additional Davis-Smyth patents, and one additional application (which was allowed and issued as a patent on September 25, 2012) in both the First David-Smyth Case and the Second Davis-Smyth Case.

We believe Genentech's remaining claims in the First Davis Smyth Case and the Second Davis Smyth Case are without merit and intend to continue to defend against all of Genentech's remaining claims vigorously. However, it is possible that there could be an adverse determination or judgment in either or both cases that would materially harm our business by requiring us to seek a license for matters not covered by the Agreement, which may not be available at all or on reasonable terms, or precluding the manufacture, further development, or sale of EYLEA outside the United States or ZALTRAP, or resulting in a damage award. In addition, irrespective of the outcome of the Davis-Smyth cases, we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs and expenses associated with them, which have negatively affected, and will likely continue to negatively affect, our results of operations. An adverse determination in any of the proceedings described herein may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

We have initiated patent-related actions against Genentech in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy relating in each case to a patent that expired on October 28, 2012. We may initiate other actions in other countries outside the United States, which could have similar or other adverse outcomes that would materially harm our business and which, irrespective of the outcomes, may also entail significant costs and expenses. In the United Kingdom, an adverse decision dated March 22, 2012 is under appeal. This decision found the designation of European patent EP 1 238 986 in the United Kingdom to be valid and potential acts relating to VEGF Trap Eye in the United Kingdom before expiration of the patent on October 28, 2012 to infringe this patent. A negative decision on appeal would result in an order requiring us to pay Genentech's recoverable legal costs.

We are aware of patents and pending applications owned by Roche that claim antibodies to IL-6R and methods of treating rheumatoid arthritis with such antibodies. We are developing sarilumab, an antibody to IL-6R, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although we do not believe that sarilumab infringes any valid claim in these patents or patent applications, Roche could initiate a lawsuit for patent infringement and assert its patents are valid and cover sarilumab.

We are aware of a U.S. patent jointly owned by Genentech and City of Hope relating to the production of recombinant antibodies in host cells. We currently produce our antibody product candidates using recombinant antibodies from host cells and may choose to produce additional antibody product candidates in this manner. Neither ARCALYST, ZALTRAP, nor EYLEA are recombinant antibodies. If any of our antibody product candidates are produced in a manner subject to valid claims in the Genentech patent, then we may need to obtain a license from Genentech, should one be available. Genentech has licensed this patent to several different companies under confidential license agreements. If we desire a license for any of our antibody product candidates and are unable to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be restricted in our ability to use Genentech's techniques to make recombinant antibodies in or to import them into the United States.

Further, we are aware of a number of other third-party patent applications that, if granted with claims as currently drafted, may cover our current or planned activities. It could be determined that our products and/or actions in manufacturing or selling our product candidates infringe such patents.



Patent holders in addition to Genentech could assert claims against us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or developing our drug candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties. In the event that the manufacture, use, or sale of any of our drug candidates, including EYLEA or our other late-stage product candidates, infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing, and commercialization of those drugs and may be required to pay costly damages. Such a result may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. In any event, legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to defend.

We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment, such licenses are needed or advisable. If any licenses are required, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our product candidates, which could severely harm our business.

Loss or limitation of patent rights, and new regulatory pathways for biosimilar competition, could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our products.

In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which it has market exclusivity. In the United States and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there usually are very substantial and rapid declines in the product's sales.

If our late-stage product candidates or other clinical candidates are approved for marketing in the United States or elsewhere, market exclusivity for those products will generally be based upon patent rights and/or certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. As described above under "

If we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will be harmed

", the scope and enforceability of our patent rights may vary from country to country. The failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use, or the loss, of such rights could be material to us. Absent patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products, it is possible, both in the United States and elsewhere, that generic and/or biosimilar versions of those products may be approved and marketed which would likely result in substantial and rapid reductions in revenues from sales of those products.

Under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, enacted in 2010, there is now a new, abbreviated path in the United States for regulatory approval of biosimilar versions of biological products. The PPACA provides a regulatory mechanism that allows for FDA approval of biologic drugs that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. Under this new regulation, an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product. However, qualified innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. However, the term of regulatory exclusivity may not remain at 12 years in the United States and could be shortened.

The increased likelihood of biosimilar competition has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. Due to this risk, and uncertainties regarding patent protection, if our late-stage product candidates or other clinical candidates are approved for marketing, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity. It is also not possible to predict changes in United States regulatory law that might reduce biological product regulatory exclusivity. The loss of market exclusivity for a product would likely materially and negatively affect revenues from product sales of that product and thus our financial results and condition.



Risks Related to Manufacturing and Supply

We rely on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity, which could result in our being unable to continue to successfully commercialize

EYLEA

and to commercialize our other product candidates or other indications for our marketed products if they receive regulatory approval.

Our manufacturing facility would be inadequate to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients of (a) EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST, and (b) our antibody product candidates in sufficient clinical quantities if our clinical pipeline advances as planned. In addition to expanding our internal capacity, we intend to rely on our corporate collaborators, as well as contract manufacturers, to produce commercial quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products to the extent such quantities are not manufactured at our own facility. We rely entirely on third-parties and our collaborators for filling and finishing services. Generally, in order for other parties to perform any step in the manufacturing and supply chain, we must transfer technology to the other party which can be time consuming and may not be successfully accomplished without considerable cost and expense, or at all. We will have to depend on these other parties to perform effectively on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements. If for any reason they are unable to do so, and as a result we are unable to directly or through such third parties manufacture and supply sufficient commercial quantities of our products on acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or other difficulties in our relationships with our corporate collaborators, third-party manufacturers, or other parties involved in our supply chain which adversely affect the timely manufacture and supply of our products, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.

Expanding our manufacturing capacity will be costly and we may be unsuccessful in doing so in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent the launch and successful commercialization of our marketed products and late-stage product candidates or other indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing and could jeopardize our current and future clinical development programs.

As described under “Manufacturing” in Item 1 above, we have recently commenced construction of additional manufacturing space at our Rensselaer, New York site to increase our manufacturing capacity and, in the future, we may lease, operate, purchase, or construct additional facilities to conduct expanded manufacturing activities. Expanding our manufacturing capacity to supply commercial quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our marketed products and our late-stage product candidates if they are approved for marketing, and to supply clinical drug material to support the continued growth of our clinical programs, will require substantial additional expenditures and various regulatory approvals and permits. In addition, we will need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our expanding manufacturing and supply chain operations. Start-up costs can be large and scale-up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields. In addition, we may face difficulties or delays in developing or acquiring the necessary production equipment and technology to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA and analogous foreign regulatory authorities must determine that our existing and any expanded manufacturing facilities comply, or continue to comply, with cGMP requirements for both clinical and commercial production and license them, or continue to license them, accordingly, and such facilities must also comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other governmental permitting requirements. We may not successfully expand or establish sufficient manufacturing capabilities or manufacture our products economically or in compliance with cGMPs and other regulatory requirements, and we and our collaborators may not be able to build or procure additional capacity in the required timeframe to meet commercial demand for our late-stage product candidates if they receive regulatory approval, and to continue to meet the requirements of our clinical programs. This would interfere with our efforts to successfully commercialize EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST and could also delay or require us to discontinue one or more of our clinical development programs. As a result, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed.

Our ability to manufacture our products may be impaired if any of our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe third-party patents.

Our ability to continue to manufacture EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST in our Rensselaer, New York facilities, or to utilize third parties to produce our products, to supply raw materials or other products, or to perform fill/finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain, depends on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. A judicial decision in favor of one or more parties making such allegations could preclude the manufacture of our products where those intellectual property rights apply which could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.



If sales of EYLEA and ZALTRAP do not meet the levels currently expected, or if the launch of new indications for EYLEA or of any of our product candidates is delayed or unsuccessful, we may face costs related to unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities and at the facilities of third parties.

We have large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New York. We use our facilities to produce bulk product of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, bulk product of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, bulk product of ZALTRAP for the treatment of patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen, and clinical and preclinical candidates for ourselves and our collaborations, and plan to use such facilities to produce bulk product for commercial supply of new indications of our marketed products and new product candidates if they are approved for marketing. If our clinical candidates are discontinued or their clinical development is delayed, if the launch of new indications for our marketed products or new product candidates is delayed or does not occur, or if such products are launched and the launch is unsuccessful or the product is subsequently recalled or marketing approval is rescinded, we may have to absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and inefficiencies, as well as similar costs of third-party contract manufacturers performing services for us.

Third-party service or supply failures, or other failures, business interruptions, or natural disasters affecting our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York or the facilities of any other party participating in the supply chain, would adversely affect our ability to supply our products.

We currently manufacture all of our bulk drug materials at our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York. We would be unable to manufacture these materials if our Rensselaer facilities were to cease production due to regulatory requirements or actions, business interruptions, labor shortages or disputes, contaminations, fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other problems at the facilities.

Also, certain raw materials or other products necessary for the manufacture and formulation of EYLEA, ZALTRAP, ARCALYST, and our product candidates are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. In addition, we rely on certain third parties to perform filling, finishing, distribution, laboratory testing, and other services related to the manufacture of EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST, and our product candidates, and to supply various raw materials and other products. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, other products, or services for an indeterminate period of time if any of these third parties were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or actions, adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, failure by the supplier to comply with cGMPs, business interruptions, or labor shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture or supply EYLEA, ZALTRAP, ARCALYST, and our product candidates, which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects.

Certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and the formulation of our product candidates may be derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum, and human serum albumin. There are certain European regulatory restrictions on using these biological source materials. If we are required to substitute for these sources to comply with European regulatory requirements, our clinical development activities may be delayed or interrupted.



If we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates, we could incur substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch if they obtain regulatory approval, and a reduction in sales.

We and our third-party providers are required to maintain compliance with cGMPs, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application(s) to the FDA or such comparable foreign agencies and acceptance of the change by the FDA or such comparable foreign agencies prior to release of product(s). Because we produce multiple products and product candidates at our facility in Rensselaer, New York, including EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST, there are increased risks associated with cGMP compliance. Our inability, or the inability of our third-party fill/finish or other service providers, to demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and expensive remediation efforts, withdraw or recall product, halt or interrupt clinical trials, and/or interrupt commercial supply of any marketed products, and could also delay or prevent our obtaining regulatory approval for our late-stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products. Any delay, interruption, or other issue that arises in the manufacture, fill/finish, packaging, or storage of any drug product or product candidate as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cGMP compliance could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain approval for, and successfully commercialize our products, which would substantially harm our business and prospects. Any finding of non-compliance could also increase our costs, cause us to delay the development of our product candidates, result in delay in our obtaining, or our not obtaining, regulatory approval of product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, and cause us to lose revenue from any marketed products, which could be seriously detrimental to our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Commercialization of Products

We may be unsuccessful in continuing the commercialization of our marketed products or in commercializing our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if approved, which would materially and adversely affect our business, profitability, and future prospects.

Even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products will depend upon, among other things, their acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party payers and on our and our collaborators' ability to successfully manufacture, market and distribute those products in substantial commercial quantities or to establish and manage the required infrastructure to do so, including large-scale information technology systems and a large-scale distribution network. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications, if they are not successfully commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be severely harmed.

Our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery and this could adversely affect the commercial success of those products if they receive marketing approval.

Currently, we have three marketed products, EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST.  While we have established our own sales and marketing organization for EYLEA in the United States for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, we have limited commercialization experience and we have no sales, marketing, commercial, or distribution capabilities outside the United States. In addition, EYLEA faces intense competition from Lucentis

®

and from off-label use of Avastin

®

, both of which have been on the market for a number of years and, potentially, from new competitive products currently in clinical development. We expect that the continued commercial success of EYLEA will depend on many factors, including the following:

•

the effectiveness of our and Bayer HealthCare's commercial strategies for the launch and marketing of EYLEA in and outside the United States, respectively, including pricing strategy and the effectiveness of efforts to obtain, and the timing of obtaining, adequate third-party reimbursements;

•

maintaining and successfully monitoring commercial manufacturing arrangements for EYLEA with third parties who perform fill/finish or other steps in the manufacture of EYLEA to ensure that they meet our standards and those of regulatory authorities, including the FDA, which extensively regulate and monitor pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities;

•

our ability to meet the demand for commercial supplies of EYLEA;

•

our ability to effectively communicate to the marketplace the benefits of the dosing regimen of EYLEA as compared to the dosing regimen of Lucentis

®

, and the willingness of retinal specialists and patients to switch from Lucentis

®

or off-label use of Avastin

®

to EYLEA;



•

the ability of patients, retinal specialists, and other providers to obtain and maintain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and other government and private payers in the United States and foreign jurisdictions;

•

our ability to maintain sales of EYLEA in the face of new competitive products currently in clinical development; and

•

the effect of new health care legislation currently being implemented in the United States.

Under the terms of our license and collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare, we rely on Bayer HealthCare for sales, marketing, and distribution of EYLEA in countries outside the United States. If we and Bayer HealthCare are unsuccessful in continuing to commercialize EYLEA, our ability to sustain profitability would be materially impaired. In addition, if we or our collaborators are unable to successfully commercialize new product candidates or new indications for our marketed product, our future prospects would be materially impaired.

Our marketed products are subject to significant competition, and our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if any are approved for marketing, may face significant competition.

There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and chemical companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. Our smaller competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even if we achieve commercialization of our product candidates, our competitors have achieved, and may continue to achieve, product commercialization before our products are approved for marketing and sale.

As previously noted, Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

, on the market for treating certain cancers and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, Amgen, Inc., Imclone LLC/Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Inc., AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline. Some of these molecules may offer competitive advantages over our molecule. Each of Pfizer, Onyx (together with its partner Bayer HealthCare), and GlaxoSmithKline are marketing and selling oral medications that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth of tumors. It will be difficult for ZALTRAP to compete against Avastin

®

and the FDA approved kinase inhibitors, because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these medicines. In addition, an oral medication may be considerably less expensive for patients than a biologic medication, providing a competitive advantage to companies that market such products.

The market for eye disease products is also very competitive. Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody fragment, Lucentis

®

for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following RVO, DME, and other eye indications. Lucentis

®

was approved by the FDA in June 2006 for the treatment of wet AMD and in June 2010 for the treatment of macular edema following RVO, CRVO, and BRVO. Lucentis

®

was also approved by the EMA for wet AMD in January 2007 and for DME in January 2011. Many other companies are working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of wet AMD, DME and RVO including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors, as well as siRNAs that modulate gene expression. For example, in January 2012, Genentech submitted an IND for such an extended delivery device. Ophthotech Corporation is developing Fovista

™

, an aptamer directed against PDGF-ß, as a product candidate intended to be used in combination with an anti-VEGF therapy. In June 2012, Ophthotech announced results of a Phase 2b study that it claimed demonstrated that Fovista

™

administered in combination with Lucentis

®

resulted in increased visual outcomes compared to Lucentis

®

monotherapy. Allergan is developing an anti-VEGF-A DARPin

®

, as well as a dual anti-VEGF-A/PDGF-ß DARPin

®

, and its corresponding backups for the treatment of wet AMD and related conditions. Allergan has announced that it expects Phase 2 data in wet AMD from its anti-VEGF-A DARPin

®

2013.

In addition, ophthalmologists are using with success off-label, third-party repackaged versions of Genentech's approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

, for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, and macular edema following RVO.Long-term, controlled clinical trials comparing Lucentis

®

to Avastin

®

in the treatment of wet AMD are being conducted. One-year data from the CATT study were reported in April 2011 and indicated that Avastin

®

dosed monthly was non-inferior to Lucentis

®

dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean visual acuity gain at 52 weeks. Two-year data from CATT were reported in April 2012 and indicated that Avastin

®

was non-inferior to Lucentis

®

in mean visual acuity gain; as-needed dosing was not non-inferior to monthly dosing. It may be difficult for EYLEA in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved to compete against Lucentis

®

and off-label use of Avastin

®

because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these medicines. Moreover, the reported results of the CATT study, combined with the relatively low cost of Avastin

®

in treating patients with wet AMD, may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which EYLEA will face in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved. In addition, while we believe that ZALTRAP would not be well tolerated if administered directly to the eye, there is a risk that third parties will attempt to repackage ZALTRAP for off-label use and sale for the treatment of wet AMD and other diseases of the eye, which would present a potential low-cost competitive threat to EYLEA for wet AMD, macular edema following CRVO, or other eye indications.



There are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other companies that are designed to block the synthesis of IL-1 or inhibit the signaling of IL-1. For example, Eli Lilly, Xoma (in collaboration with Servier), and Novartis are each developing antibodies to IL-1 and both Amgen and MedImmune are developing antibodies to the IL-1 receptor. In 2009, Novartis received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for Ilaris

®

, a fully human anti-interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) antibody, for the treatment of CAPS. Ilaris

®

is also in development for atherosclerosis and a number of other inflammatory diseases. Novartis' IL-1 antibody and these other drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over ARCALYST. For example, Ilaris

®

is dosed once every eight weeks compared to the once-weekly dosing regimen for ARCALYST. The successful development and/or commercialization of these competing molecules could adversely affect sales of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS.

Our earlier stage clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies, which were generated using our

VelocImmune

technology. Our antibody generation technologies and earlier-stage clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies.

Numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products. Companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Biogen Idec, Novartis, Genentech/Roche, Bristol-Myers Squib, AbbVie, and GlaxoSmithKline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in development or on the market that are derived from recombinant DNA that comprise human antibody sequences.

We are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against targets that are also the targets of our early-stage product candidates. For example, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and AbbVie are developing antibody product candidates against NGF. Genentech/Roche is marketing an antibody against IL-6R (tocilizumab) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and several other companies, including Centocor/Johnson & Johnson, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, have antibodies against IL-6 in clinical development for this disease. GlaxoSmithKline, in partnership with OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, has a Dll4 antibody in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors. Aerovance has two formulations of a biologic directed against IL-4 in clinical development. Amgen previously had an antibody against IL-4R in clinical development for the treatment of asthma. Several companies, including Amgen, Pfizer, and Roche, have development programs for antibodies against PCSK9. Amgen, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca have development programs underway for antibodies against ANG2. Alnylam, in partnership with The Medicines Company, has a clinical program underway with an RNAi molecule against PCSK9. If any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product, such developments may have an adverse effect on our business or future prospects.

The successful commercialization of our marketed products, as well as our late-stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if approved, will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and these payers may not agree to cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that make our products uncompetitive and/or unprofitable, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

Our product candidates, if commercialized, may be significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments. Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected in a material manner if United States and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and payers, and other third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our products to the patients. If these entities do not provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to our products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe them. Many third-party payers cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such payers more expensive for patients, and require prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug. In particular, payers may impose these obstacles to coverage on higher-priced drugs, as our product candidates are likely to be.

Government and other third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs. In March 2010, the PPACA and a related reconciliation bill were enacted in the United States. This legislation imposes cost containment measures that are likely to adversely affect the amount of reimbursement for our future products. The full effects of this legislation are unknown at this time and will not be known until regulations and guidance are issued by CMS and other federal and state agencies. Further, in September 2011 the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report entitled “Review of Medicare Part B Avastin and Lucentis Treatments for Age-Related Macular Degeneration” in which the OIG details possible savings to the Medicare program by using off-label Avastin

®

rather than Lucentis

®

for the treatment of wet AMD. Some states are also considering legislation that would control the prices of drugs, and state Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. It is likely that federal and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on additional health care reform in the future that will impose additional constraints on prices and reimbursements for our products.



Since EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following CRVO, and other eye diseases, and ZALTRAP for the treatment of patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen, will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if these products are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, our ability to successfully commercialize these products would be materially adversely impacted. Third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, may not cover and/or reimburse for these products at levels required for us to successfully commercialize these products. Any limitation imposed by third-party payers on the use of our products if they are approved for marketing, or any action or decision by CMS or analogous foreign agencies or authorities which for any reason denies coverage or reimbursement for our products or provides coverage or reimbursement at levels that harm our products' competitiveness or leads to lower prices for those products, will have a material negative effect on our ability to sustain profitability. In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage, and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control, and we and our collaborators may be unable to obtain coverage, pricing, and/or reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us or necessary for us or our collaborators to successfully commercialize our products in those countries. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Our results of operations may suffer if we or our collaborators are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited or delayed.

We are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of or significant reduction in sales to these customers would adversely affect our results of operations.

We sell EYLEA in the United States to three distributors and several specialty pharmacies. We sell ARCALYST in the United States to two specialty pharmacies. Under these distribution models, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product. For EYLEA, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers, whereas for ARCALYST, the specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded

78%

of our total gross product revenue from sales to a single distributor, Besse Medical, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen Corporation. We expect this significant customer concentration

to continue for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate and grow sales of EYLEA will depend, in part, on the extent to which our distributors and specialty pharmacies are able to provide adequate distribution of EYLEA to healthcare providers. Although we believe we can find additional distributors , if necessary, our revenue during any period of disruption could suffer and we might incur additional costs. In addition, these customers are responsible for a significant portion of our net trade accounts receivable  balances.  The loss of any large customer, a significant reduction in sales we make to them, any cancellation of orders they have made with us, or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them could adversely affect our results of operations.

Regulatory and Litigation Risks

If the testing or use of our products harms people, we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.

The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk. Any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of litigation. We may also be subject to claims by patients who use our approved products, or our product candidates if those product candidates receive regulatory approval and become commercially available, that they have been injured by a side effect associated with the drug. We may face product liability claims and be found responsible even if injury arises from the acts or omissions of our third-party fill/finish or other providers. Our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation. Moreover, in the future we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms.



If we market and sell approved products in a way that violates federal or state healthcare laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

In addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care “fraud and abuse” laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. Federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, payments or other remuneration to induce or reward someone to purchase, prescribe, endorse, or recommend a product that is reimbursed under federal or state healthcare programs. If we provide payments or other remuneration to a healthcare professional to induce the prescribing of our products, we could face liability under state and federal anti-kickback laws.

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, known as off-label uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses, and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate program.

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment.

Even if it is determined that we have not violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would harm our business and financial results and condition. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be challenged under one or more of such laws.

In recent years, several states and localities, including California, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, and file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities. Similar requirements are being considered in other states. In addition, as part of the PPACA, pharmaceutical companies will be required to file reports with the federal government regarding payments made to healthcare professionals. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear. Nonetheless, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, which would harm our business and financial results and condition.

Risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents, or contractors, or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation.

We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including without limitation, healthcare, employment, foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition, and privacy laws. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, and monetary and injunctive penalties, and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, operating results, and reputation.

Our operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, and we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials.

As a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is substantial. If an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage.



Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, and accounting requirements and regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial results and condition.

We are subject to changing rules and regulations of various federal and state governmental authorities as well as the stock exchange on which our Common Stock is listed. These entities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional requirements and regulations in response to laws enacted by Congress, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and, most recently, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that expressly authorized or required the SEC to adopt additional rules in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management's time from other business activities.

Changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.

All aspects of our business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, pricing, sales, litigation, and intellectual property rights, are subject to extensive legislation and regulation. Changes in applicable federal and state laws and agency regulations could have a materially negative impact on our business. These include:

•

changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory processes for new therapeutics that may delay or prevent the approval of any of our current or future product candidates;

•

new laws, regulations, or judicial decisions related to healthcare availability or the payment for healthcare products and services, including prescription drugs, that would make it more difficult for us to market and sell products once they are approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies;

•

changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring prior to or after the introduction of new products to market, which could materially increase our costs of doing business; and

•

changes in FDA and foreign cGMPs that may make it more difficult and costly for us to maintain regulatory compliance and/or manufacture our marketed product and product candidates in accordance with cGMPs.

As described above, the PPACA and potential regulations thereunder easing the entry of competing follow-on biologics into the marketplace, other new legislation or implementation of existing statutory provisions on importation of lower-cost competing drugs from other jurisdictions, and legislation on comparative effectiveness research are examples of previously enacted and possible future changes in laws that could adversely affect our business.



Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties

If our antibody collaboration with Sanofi is terminated, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to discover, develop, manufacture, and commercialize our pipeline of product candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed.

We rely heavily on funding from Sanofi to support our target discovery and antibody research and development programs. Sanofi has committed to pay up to $160 million per year, or a total of $1.28 billion, between 2010 and 2017 to fund our efforts to identify and validate drug discovery targets and pre-clinically develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against such targets. Sanofi has a one-time option to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing in 2014 if over the prior two years certain specified criteria are not satisfied. If this downward adjustment occurs, it will reduce our resources available for antibody discovery activities and negatively affect our clinical pipeline. Sanofi also initially funds almost all of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the clinical development of antibodies that Sanofi elects to co-develop with us. We rely on Sanofi to fund these activities. In addition, with respect to those antibodies that Sanofi elects to co-develop with us, such as sarilumab, REGN727, REGN668, REGN421, REGN910, and REGN1033, we rely on Sanofi to lead much of the clinical development efforts and assist with obtaining regulatory approval, particularly outside the United States. We also rely on Sanofi to lead the commercialization efforts to support all of the antibody products that are co-developed by Sanofi and us if they receive regulatory approval. If Sanofi does not elect to co-develop the antibodies that we discover or opts-out of their development, we would be required to fund and oversee on our own the clinical trials, any regulatory responsibilities, and the ensuing commercialization efforts to support those antibody products. For example, during 2011 and 2012, Sanofi elected not to continue co-development of REGN846 and REGN475, and decided not to opt-in to the REGN1154 and REGN1500 programs. If Sanofi terminates the antibody collaboration or fails to comply with its payment obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed. We would be required to either expend substantially more resources than we have anticipated to support our research and development efforts, which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, or materially cut back on such activities. Even though none of the antibodies from this collaboration may ever be successfully developed and commercialized, if Sanofi does not perform its obligations with respect to antibodies that it elects to co-develop, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these antibody product candidates will be significantly adversely affected.

If our collaboration with Sanofi for ZALTRAP is terminated, or Sanofi materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, and financial condition, and our ability to develop and commercialize ZALTRAP would be materially harmed.

We rely heavily on Sanofi to lead much of the development of ZALTRAP and the commercialization of ZALTRAP. If Sanofi fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to develop and commercialize ZALTRAP in previously-treated mCRC will be significantly adversely affected. Sanofi has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon twelve months advance notice. If Sanofi were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us, we would not have the resources or skills to replace those of our collaborator, which we would have to develop or outsource at substantial additional costs to us. In particular, we have limited commercial capabilities outside the United States and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities. Termination of the Sanofi collaboration agreement for ZALTRAP would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of ZALTRAP.



If our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare for EYLEA is terminated, or Bayer HealthCare materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to continue to develop EYLEA and commercialize EYLEA outside the United States in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed.

We rely heavily on Bayer HealthCare to assist with the development, and the commercialization outside the United States, of EYLEA. Under our agreement with them, Bayer HealthCare is required to fund approximately half of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the global EYLEA development program. As the EYLEA program continues, we will continue to rely on Bayer HealthCare to assist with funding the EYLEA development program, continue to lead the development of EYLEA outside the United States, obtain regulatory approval outside the United States, and provide all sales, marketing, and commercial support for the product outside the United States. In particular, Bayer HealthCare has responsibility for selling EYLEA outside the United States using its sales force and in Japan, together with Santen Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. pursuant to a Co-Promotion and Distribution Agreement with Bayer HealthCare's Japanese affiliate. EYLEA has received regulatory approvals for the treatment of wet AMD in Australia, Japan, and certain European and Latin American countries. While we cannot assure you that EYLEA will receive additional regulatory approvals outside the United States or be successfully commercialized, if Bayer HealthCare and, in Japan, Santen do not perform their obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize EYLEA outside the United States will be significantly adversely affected. Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination. If Bayer HealthCare were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us, we would not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner, which could require us to seek additional funding or another collaboration that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant delays in the development and/or commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States and result in substantial additional costs to us. We have limited commercial capabilities outside the United States and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities. Termination of the Bayer HealthCare collaboration agreement would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of EYLEA, particularly outside the United States.

Our collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their efforts to support the development, manufacture, and commercialization of our drug candidates and current and future products.

We depend upon third-party collaborators, including Sanofi, Bayer HealthCare, and service providers such as CROs, outside testing laboratories, clinical investigator sites, and third-party manufacturers, fill/finish, and product packagers and labelers, to assist us in the manufacture and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We also depend, or will depend, on some of these third parties in connection with the commercialization of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, ZALTRAP for the treatment of patients with mCRC, ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, and our late-stage product candidates and new indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing. If any of our existing collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner or in compliance with applicable GMPs, GLPs, or GCP Standards, we could experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the manufacture or development of, or in obtaining approval by regulatory authorities for, or successfully commercializing our product candidates.

We rely on third-party service providers to support the distribution of EYLEA and ARCALYST in the United States and for many other related activities in connection with the commercialization of these marketed products. Despite our arrangements with them, these third parties may not perform adequately. If these service providers do not perform their services adequately, our sales of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO and ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS will suffer.

Risk Related to Employees

We are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our business will be harmed.

We are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers, other key members of our senior management team, and our Chairman. If we are not able to retain any of these persons, our business may suffer. In particular, we depend on the services of P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., the Chairman of our board of directors, Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron Laboratories, and Neil Stahl, Ph.D., our Senior Vice President, Research and Development Sciences. As we commercialize EYLEA in the United States for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, we are also be highly dependent on the expertise and services of members of our senior management leading these commercialization efforts. There is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary to continue to advance our business and achieve our strategic objectives.



Information Technology Risks

Significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.

Our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex, and interdependent information technology systems, including Internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and computer viruses which may result in the impairment of production and key business processes.

In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches-whether by employees or others-which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others.

Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

Our stock price is extremely volatile.

There has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies' securities. Various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock. These factors include, by way of example:

•

fluctuations in our operating results; in particular, net product sales of EYLEA. In addition, to a lesser degree, sales of ZALTRAP and ARCALYST and, if any of our product candidates or our new indications for our marketed products receive regulatory approval, net product sales of, and profits from, these product candidates and new indications;

•

market acceptance of, and fluctuations in market share for, our marketed products, especially EYLEA;

•

whether our net products sales and net profits, underperform, meet, or exceed the expectations of investors or analysts;

•

announcement of actions by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or their respective advisory committees regarding our, or our collaborators’, or our competitors', currently pending or future application(s) for regulatory approval of product candidate(s) or new indications for marketed products;

•

announcement of submission of an application for regulatory approval of one or more of our, or our competitors',  product candidates or new indications for marketed products;

•

progress, delays, or results in clinical trials of our or our competitors’ product candidates or new indications for marketed products;

•

announcement of technological innovations or product candidates by us or competitors;

•

third-party claims that our products or technologies infringe their patents;

•

third-party challenges to our patents in the European Patent Office and in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office;

•

public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of any of our marketed products, EYLEA, ZALTRAP, or ARCALYST, or product candidates or new indications for our marketed products;

•

pricing or reimbursement actions or decisions by government authorities or insurers affecting the coverage or reimbursement of any of our marketed products or competitors’ products;

•

our ability to raise additional capital as needed on favorable terms;

•

developments in our relationships with collaborative partners or key customers;

•

developments in the biotechnology industry or in government regulation of healthcare;

•

large sales of our Common Stock by our executive officers, directors, or significant shareholders;

•

arrivals and departures of key personnel; and

•

general market conditions.

In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined, based on our facts and circumstances, that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets would be realized and, as a result, substantially all of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was released. Therefore, beginning in 2013, we expect to commence recording income tax expense at an estimated tax rate that will likely approximate statutory tax rates, which would result in a significant reduction in our net income and net income per share and may have an impact on the market price of our Common Stock.



The trading price of our Common Stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors, including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our Common Stock in the market. Broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.

Future sales of our Common Stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings.

A small number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2012, our five largest shareholders plus Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D, Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 54.1% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, the conversion of his Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012. In September 2003, Sanofi (then Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.) purchased 2,799,552 newly issued, unregistered shares of our Common Stock, and in December 2007 Sanofi purchased an additional 12,000,000 newly issued, unregistered shares of our Common Stock. Under our investor agreement, as amended, with Sanofi, these shares may not be sold until December 20, 2017 except under limited circumstances and subject to earlier termination of these restrictions upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, in October 2010, Sanofi purchased an additional 1,017,401 shares of Common Stock in our underwritten public offering. As of December 31, 2012, Sanofi beneficially owned 15,816,953 shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 16.6% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In February 2013, we received from Sanofi a notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that it intends to acquire additional Common Stock through open market purchases and direct purchases from shareholders. If Sanofi, or our other significant shareholders or we, sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, or there is a perception that such sales may occur, the market price of our Common Stock could fall. Sales of Common Stock by our significant shareholders, including Sanofi, also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.

Our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval.

Holders of Class A Stock, who are generally the shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our initial public offering, are entitled to ten votes per share, while holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. As of December 31, 2012, holders of Class A Stock held 17.9% of the combined voting power of all shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock then outstanding. These shareholders, if acting together, would be in a position to significantly influence the election of our directors and the vote on certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes, including mergers and other business combinations. This may result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may not consider to be in their best interest and may affect the price of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2012:

•

our current executive officers and directors beneficially owned 11.1% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming conversion of their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012, and 23.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012; and

•

our five largest shareholders plus Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 54.1% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, the conversion of his Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012. In addition, these five shareholders held 58.6% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by our Chief Executive Officer which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012.

Pursuant to an investor agreement, as amended, Sanofi has agreed to vote its shares, at Sanofi's election, either as recommended by our board of directors or proportionally with the votes cast by our other shareholders, except with respect to certain change of control transactions, liquidation or dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding 10% of the then outstanding shares or voting rights of Common Stock and Class A Stock, and new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially consistent with our historical equity compensation practices.



The anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and of New York corporate law and the contractual “standstill” provisions in our investor agreement with Sanofi, could deter, delay, or prevent an acquisition or other “change in control” of us and could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.

Our restated certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the New York Business Corporation Law contain various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. Some of these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. These provisions include:

•

authorization to issue “blank check” preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval, with rights senior to those of our Common Stock and Class A Stock;

•

a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all of our directors;

•

a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors;

•

a provision whereby any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, only if, prior to such action, all of our shareholders consent, the effect of which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at a duly convened meeting;

•

a requirement that any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this intention in writing and meet various other requirements; and

•

under the New York Business Corporation Law, in addition to certain restrictions which may apply to “business combinations” involving our company and an “interested shareholder”, a plan of merger or consolidation of our company must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. See the risk factor immediately above captioned

“Our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval.”

Until the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of our antibody collaboration agreements with Sanofi or our ZALTRAP collaboration with Sanofi, Sanofi will be bound by certain “standstill” provisions, as amended, which contractually prohibit Sanofi from acquiring more than certain specified percentages of our Class A Stock and Common Stock (taken together) or otherwise seeking to obtain control of our company.

In addition, we have a Change in Control Severance Plan and our Chief Executive Officer has an employment agreement that provides severance benefits in the event our officers are terminated as a result of a change in control of our company. Many of our stock options issued under our Second Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, may become fully vested in connection with a “change in control” of our company, as defined in the plan. These contractual provisions may also have the effect of deterring, delaying, or preventing an acquisition or other change in control.

Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Related Hedge Transactions

The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes issuance may affect the trading price of our Common Stock.

In connection with our offering of our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due October 1, 2016, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with four financial institutions (the “hedge counterparties”). The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our Common Stock and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the notes, as the case may be upon conversion of the notes. In the event that the hedge counterparties fail to deliver shares to us or potential cash payments as the case may be as required under the convertible note hedge documents, we would not receive the benefit of such transactions. Separately, we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect from the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the warrants.

In connection with hedging these transactions, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our Common Stock, and may enter into, or may unwind, various derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our Common Stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to any conversion of the notes). These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in, or could have a negative effect on, the value of our Common Stock and could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the value of our Common Stock during any cash settlement averaging period related to a conversion of the notes.



In addition, we intend to exercise options under the convertible note hedge transactions whenever notes are converted. In order to unwind its hedge position with respect to the options we exercise, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may sell shares of our Common Stock or other securities in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our Common Stock during the cash settlement averaging period for the converted notes. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our Common Stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock and the value of the notes. The derivative transactions that the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates expect to enter into to hedge these transactions may include cash-settled equity swaps referenced to our Common Stock. In certain circumstances, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may have derivative positions that, when combined with the hedge counterparties' and their affiliates' ownership of our Common Stock, if any, would give them economic exposure to the return on a significant number of shares of our Common Stock.

The fundamental change provisions of our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes and certain of the terms of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.

The fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow noteholders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the notes, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with make-whole fundamental changes, as set forth in the indenture, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events, the convertible note hedge transactions would be exercised upon the conversion of notes, and the warrant transactions may be terminated. It is possible that the proceeds we receive upon the exercise of the convertible note hedge transactions would be significantly lower than the amounts we would be required to pay upon termination of the warrant transactions. Such differences may result in the acquisition of us being on terms less favorable to our shareholders than it would otherwise be.

ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

We conduct our research, development, manufacturing, and administrative activities at our owned and leased facilities. Under our lease in Tarrytown, New York, as amended, we lease approximately 561,000 square feet of laboratory and office facilities. In addition, in September 2011 we entered into a lease amendment under our Tarrytown lease for approximately 40,000 additional square feet of space, which will commence contingent upon certain building improvements being completed by our landlord. We currently expect that these improvements will be completed during the first half of 2013. The term of the Tarrytown, New York lease will expire in June 2024. The lease contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each and early termination options on approximately 331,000 square feet of space. The lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.

In July 2011, we entered into a lease for approximately 19,600 square feet of office space in Liberty Corner, New Jersey. The term of the lease expires in January 2017.



The following table summarizes information regarding our current real property leases:

_______________

(1)

Excludes additional charges for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses, as defined.

We own facilities in Rensselaer, New York, consisting of three buildings totaling approximately 395,000 square feet of research, manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. In addition, we have recently commenced construction of approximately 93,000 square feet of additional manufacturing and office space at our Rensselaer site.

In the future, we may lease, operate, purchase, or construct additional facilities in which to conduct expanded research and development and manufacturing activities and support commercial operations.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings in the course of our business. We do not expect any such current ordinary course legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Genentech Patent Litigation

We are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptors. We do not believe that ZALTRAP or EYLEA infringe any valid claim in these patents or patent applications. We are involved in five patent litigations with Genentech, two in the United States and three in Europe. In November 2010, we commenced a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court), seeking a declaratory judgment that no activities relating to our VEGF Trap infringe any valid claim of certain Genentech patents referred to as the Davis-Smyth patents (the First Davis-Smyth Case). Genentech answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims that our prior or planned activities relating to VEGF Trap have infringed or will infringe claims of four of the Davis-Smyth patents and requested a judgment against us for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

On December 31, 2011, we entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement with Genentech (the Genentech Agreement) that covers making, using, and selling EYLEA in the United States for the prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States, and ends the litigation relating to those matters. Under the Genentech Agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth patents, and certain other technology patents owned or co-owned by Genentech. The Genentech Agreement does not cover any non-U.S. patent rights or non-U.S. patent disputes, and does not cover any use of aflibercept other than for prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States. The First Davis-Smyth Case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the Genentech Agreement. The Genentech Agreement provides for us to make payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA through May 7, 2016, the date the Davis-Smyth patents expire. As required by the Genentech Agreement, in the third quarter of 2012, we made a lump-sum payment of $60.0 million when cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA reached $400 million. We will also pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA over $3 billion. As a result of the Genentech Agreement, on January 17, 2012, Genentech filed a second amended answer and counterclaim in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in which it amended its counterclaims alleging infringement of four of the Davis-Smyth patents. On December 23, 2011, Genentech initiated a related case in the Court against Regeneron and Sanofi alleging infringement of four of the Davis-Smyth Patents by activities relating to VEGF Trap (but excluding EYLEA) (the Second Davis-Smyth Case). As in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in the new complaint Genentech requests a judgment against us for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate. On September 21, 2012, Genentech asserted two additional Davis-Smyth patents, and one additional application (which was allowed and issued as a patent on September 25, 2012) in both the First David-Smyth Case and the Second Davis-Smyth Case.



We believe Genentech's remaining claims in the First Davis Smyth Case and the Second Davis Smyth Case are without merit and intend to continue to defend against all of Genentech's remaining claims vigorously.

We have initiated patent-related actions against Genentech in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy relating in each case to a patent that expired on October 28, 2012. We may initiate other actions in other countries outside the United States, which could have similar or other adverse outcomes that would materially harm our business and which, irrespective of the outcomes, may also entail significant costs and expenses. In the United Kingdom, an adverse decision dated March 22, 2012 is under appeal. This decision found the designation of European patent EP 1 238 986 in the United Kingdom to be valid and potential acts relating to VEGF Trap-Eye in the United Kingdom before expiration of the patent on October 28, 2012 to infringe this patent

. A negative decision on appeal would result in an order requiring us to pay Genentech's recoverable legal costs.

The selected financial data set forth below for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 and at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are derived from and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report. The selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are derived from our audited financial statements not included in this report.

(1)

Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, as described below under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations."



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Overview

We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. Our total revenues were

$1,378.5 million

in 2012, compared to $445.8 million in 2011 and $459.1 million in 2010. In 2012, we earned a $50.0 million substantive milestone payment from Sanofi upon FDA approval of ZALTRAP, as well as $15.0 million and $10.0 million substantive milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval, respectively, in Japan for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD. Our net income was

$750.3 million

, or

$6.75

per diluted share, in 2012, compared to net losses of

$221.8 million

, or $2.45 per share (basic and diluted), in 2011 and

$104.5 million

, or $1.26 per share (basic and diluted), in 2010. Net income in 2012 included an income tax benefit of

$335.8 million

primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our  deferred tax assets, as described below under "Results of Operations."

We currently have three marketed products:

•

EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection, which is available in the United States for the treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO, and in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, and certain other countries for the treatment of wet AMD. We commenced sales of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in November 2011 and the treatment of macular edema following CRVO in September 2012, following receipt of regulatory approval in the United States. Bayer HealthCare commenced sales of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in the fourth quarter of 2012 following receipt of regulatory approvals in the European Union and other regions. Bayer HealthCare has additional regulatory applications for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD pending in other countries. In addition, Bayer HealthCare submitted applications for marketing authorization for EYLEA in Europe in December 2012 and in Japan in January 2013 for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO.

We are collaborating with Bayer HealthCare on the global development and commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States. Bayer HealthCare will market EYLEA outside the United States, where, for countries other than Japan, the companies will share equally the profits and losses from sales of EYLEA. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty on sales of EYLEA, as described below. We maintain exclusive rights to EYLEA in the United States and are entitled to all profits from any such sales.

Net product sales of EYLEA in the United States were $

837.9 million

in 2012 and $

24.8 million

in 2011. EYLEA net product sales outside of the United States, which are recorded by Bayer HealthCare, commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012, and were

$19.0 million

for the year.

•

ZALTRAP (ziv-aflibercept) Injection for Intravenous Infusion, which is available in the United States for treatment, in combination with FOLFIRI, of patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. In February 2013, the EC granted marketing authorization in the European Union for ZALTRAP 25mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion in combination with FOLRIRI chemotherapy in adults with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Regulatory applications for marketing authorization of ZALTRAP for the treatment of previously treated mCRC patients in other countries have also been submitted and are currently under review by the respective regulatory agencies.

We and Sanofi globally collaborate on the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP, and share profits and losses from commercialization of ZALTRAP, except for Japan, where we are entitled to a royalty on sales of ZALTRAP, as described below. ZALTRAP net product sales, which are recorded by Sanofi, commenced in the United States in August 2012 and totaled $

31.7 million

in 2012.

•

ARCALYST (rilonacept) Injection for Subcutaneous Use, which is available in the United States for the treatment of CAPS, including FCAS and MWS, in adults and children 12 and older. CAPS are a group of rare, inherited, auto-inflammatory conditions characterized by life-long, recurrent symptoms of rash, fever/chills, joint pain, eye redness/pain, and fatigue.

Net product sales of ARCALYST totaled $

20.2 million

in 2012, $

19.9 million

in 2011 and $

25.3 million

in 2010. Net product sales of ARCALYST in 2010 included $20.5 million of ARCALYST net product sales made in 2010 and $4.8



million of previously deferred net product sales, as described below under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations." We do not expect future net product sales of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS to be significant.

Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense. Before significant revenues from the commercialization of our antibody candidates or new indications for our marketed products can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we reported profitability; prior to that, we generally incurred net losses. Our ability to continue to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on our success in commercializing EYLEA. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. Also, our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, will expand and require additional resources. Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our marketed products, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, the timing of certain expenses, and the continuation of our collaborations with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare, including our share of collaboration profits or losses, or royalties, from sales of commercialized products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators. We cannot predict whether or when new products or new indications for our marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product(s) and whether or when they may become profitable.

We have 13 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our research laboratories. Our Trap-based clinical programs are:

•

EYLEA, which is in clinical trials for the treatment of DME and macular edema following BRVO, and, in Asia, mCNV, in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare; and

•

ZALTRAP, which is being studied in combination with our angiopoietin-2 inhibitor (REGN910) in oncology in collaboration with Sanofi.

Our antibody-based clinical programs include eleven fully human monoclonal antibodies. The following six are being developed in collaboration with Sanofi:

•

Sarilumab (REGN88), an antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis;

•

REGN727, an antibody to Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is being developed for LDL cholesterol reduction;

•

REGN668, an antibody to the interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R), which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma;

•

REGN421, an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4 (Dll4), a novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology;

•

REGN910, an antibody to angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), another novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology; and

•

REGN1033, an antibody to myostatin (GDF8), which is in clinical development.

In addition, we are developing the following five antibodies independently:

•

REGN1400, an antibody to ErbB3, which is being developed in oncology;

•

REGN846, an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target, which is being developed in atopic dermatitis;

•

REGN1154, an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target;

•

REGN1500, an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target; and

•

REGN475, an antibody to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), which is being developed for the treatment of pain and which is currently on clinical hold by the FDA.



The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results. In our clinical programs, key events in 2012 and 2013 to date were, and plans for the remainder of 2013 are, as follows:

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

A summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page

F-8.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

It requires an assumption (or assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and

•

Changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. The critical accounting estimates that impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.

Revenue Recognition

Product Revenue

Product sales consist of U.S. sales of EYLEA and ARCALYST. Revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, we have no further performance obligations, and returns can be reasonably estimated. We record revenue from product sales upon delivery to our distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively, our "customers").

We sell EYLEA

in the United States to three distributors and several specialty pharmacies. We sell ARCALYST in the United States to two specialty pharmacies. Under these distribution models, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product. For EYLEA, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers, whereas for ARCALYST, the specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recorded

78%

and

42%

, respectively, of our total gross product revenue from sales to Besse Medical, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen Corporation.

Revenue from product sales is recorded net of applicable provisions for rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs (including Medicaid), distribution-related fees, prompt pay discounts, product returns, and other sales-related deductions. Calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments. We review our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period's net product sales.

The following table summarizes the provisions, and credits/payments, for government rebates and chargebacks, distribution-related fees, and other sales-related deductions; such amounts were not significant during the year ended December 31, 2011.

Government Rebates and Chargebacks:

We estimate reductions to product sales for Medicaid and Veterans' Administration (VA) programs, and for certain other qualifying federal and state government programs. Based upon our contracts with government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, and, in the case of EYLEA, estimated payer mix based on third-party market research data, we estimate and record an allowance for rebates and chargebacks. Our liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for a current quarter, claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received, and invoices received for claims from prior



quarters that have not been paid. Our reserves related to discounted pricing offered to VA, Public Health Services (PHS), and other institutions (collectively, “qualified healthcare providers”) represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge to our customers. Our customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Our reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already claimed.

Distribution-Related Fees:

We have written contracts with our customers that include terms for distribution-related fees. We estimate and record distribution and related fees due to our customers based on gross sales.

Prompt Pay Discounts:

No prompt pay discounts are currently offered to our customers on sales of EYLEA. In connection with sales of ARCALYST, we offer discounts to our customers for prompt payments. We estimate these discounts based on customer terms and historical experience, and expect that our customers will always take advantage of this discount. Therefore, we accrue 100% of the prompt pay discount that is based on the gross amount of each ARCALYST invoice at the time of sale.

Product Returns:

Consistent with industry practice, we offer our customers a limited right to return product purchased directly from us, which is principally based upon the product's expiration date. We will accept returns for three months prior to and up to six months after the product expiration date. Product returned is generally not resalable given the nature of our products and method of administration. We develop estimates for product returns based upon historical experience, inventory levels in the distribution channel, shelf life of the product, and other relevant factors. We monitor product supply levels in the distribution channel, as well as sales by our customers of EYLEA to healthcare providers and ARCALYST to patients using product-specific data provided by our customers. If necessary, our estimates of product returns may be adjusted in the future based on actual returns experience, known or expected changes in the marketplace, or other factors.

Collaboration Revenue

We earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms. We currently have collaboration agreements with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare. The terms of these collaboration agreements typically include non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress (milestone) payments, payments for development activities, and sharing of profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products. Non-refundable up-front license payments, where continuing involvement is required of us, are deferred and recognized over the related performance period. We estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement, and adjust the performance periods, if appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances. Although we did not enter into, or materially modify, any collaboration arrangements with multiple-deliverables in 2011 or 2012, any future arrangements with multiple deliverables will be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria, including whether the delivered item or items has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis. Payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone. Substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the related product candidate, such as completion of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies, and receipt of approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, we take into consideration (i) enhancement in value to the related development product candidate, (ii) our performance and the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, (iii) whether the milestone relates solely to past performance, and (iv) whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms. Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related performance period.

We enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities. We may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator, such as in our EYLEA collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities, such as in our ZALTRAP and antibody collaborations with Sanofi. We record our internal and third-party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses. When we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses. If the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs, in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of the collaborator's development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse.

Under our collaboration agreements, we share in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products. Our collaborator provides us with our estimated share of the profits or losses, based on net product sales less cost of goods sold and



shared commercialization and other expenses, from commercialization of such products for the most recent fiscal quarter. Our share of the profit or loss is recorded as collaboration revenue. Our collaborators' estimates of net products sales and related expenses for such quarter are reconciled to their actual net product sales and related expenses in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our share of the profit or loss is adjusted accordingly, as necessary.

In connection with non-refundable licensing payments, our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of our research and development activities. Due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications. Also, if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement, we would recognize as revenue any unamortized remainder of an up-front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination.

Clinical Trial Expenses

Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors. We outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as CROs, independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies. For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and the period over which clinical investigators or CROs are expected to provide services.

Clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by CROs. CROs typically perform most of the start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management. On a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly wider, as many of our contracts with CROs are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change materially. These start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. In the event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or penalties.

For clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue expenses on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study. Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years. During the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. Our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results, which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known. No material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, or 2010.

Stock-based Compensation

We recognize stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock under our long-term incentive plans to employees and non-employee members of our board of directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award's requisite service period.

We use the Black-Scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives. Expected volatility has been estimated based on actual



movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options' expected lives. Expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. This estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

The assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.

In addition, we have granted performance-based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant date, related to these performance options will be recognized only if, and when, we estimate that these options will vest, which is based on whether we consider the options' performance conditions to be probable of attainment. Our estimates of the number of performance-based options that will vest will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods. Changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock-based compensation that we recognize in future periods related to performance-based options.

Income Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts (“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We periodically re-assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on various factors including our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, and forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal. Prior to 2012, we recorded a valuation allowance that fully offset our net deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2012, based on our evaluation of various factors, including our achievement of a cumulative three-year income position as of December 31, 2012, we released substantially all of our valuation allowance  against our deferred tax assets and recorded a corresponding income tax benefit as described in "Results of Operations" below. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

Uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance, which prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Those positions, for which management's assessment is that there is more than a 50% probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to certain measurement criteria.

Marketable Securities

We have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, other debt securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, and money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. We consider our marketable securities to be “available-for-sale,” as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If the decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that may be charged against income.

We review our portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. Such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. With respect to debt securities, this review process also includes an evaluation of our intent to sell an individual debt security or our need to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or maturity. With respect to equity securities, this review process includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold the securities until their full value can be recovered. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We recorded no charges for other-than-temporary impairment of our marketable securities during 2012 and 2011, and an inconsequential charge for other-than-temporary impairment of our marketable securities during 2010.



Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method. We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed as research and development. We periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and write-down such inventories as appropriate. In addition, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. If certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value. In 2012 and 2011, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling

$17.0 million

and

$0.5 million

, respectively. In 2010, there were no inventory write-downs or reserves included in cost of goods sold.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011

Net Income (Loss)

We reported net income of

$750.3 million

, or

$6.75

per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of

$221.8 million

, or

$2.45

per share (basic and diluted), for 2011. Our net income in 2012 resulted primarily from net product sales of EYLEA, which we launched in November 2011, and an income tax benefit of

$335.8 million

, primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In 2012, we also earned a $50.0 million substantive milestone payment from Sanofi upon FDA approval of ZALTRAP and $25.0 million of substantive milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approvals in Japan for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD.

Revenues

Revenues in 2012 and 2011 consist of the following:

Net Product Sales

Net product sales consist of U.S. sales of EYLEA and ARCALYST. We record product sales net of allowances and accruals for prompt pay discounts, rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs (including Medicaid), product returns, and distribution-related fees. In November 2011, we received marketing approval from the FDA for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD, at which time product sales commenced. In addition, in September 2012, we received marketing approval from the FDA for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO. In 2012 and 2011, we recognized

$837.9 million

and

$24.8 million

, respectively, of EYLEA net product sales. In 2012 and 2011, we also recognized ARCALYST net product sales of

$20.2 million

and

$19.9 million

, respectively.



Sanofi Collaboration Revenue

The collaboration revenue we earned from Sanofi, as detailed below, consisted primarily of reimbursement for research and development expenses that we incurred, recognition of our share of losses in connection with Sanofi's commercialization of ZALTRAP, recognition of a substantive milestone payment, and recognition of revenue related to non-refundable up-front payments of $105.0 million related to the ZALTRAP collaboration and $85.0 million related to the antibody collaboration.

In August 2012, the FDA approved ZALTRAP for treatment, in combination with FOLFIRI, of patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Regeneron's share of the loss in connection with commercialization of ZALTRAP, as shown in the table below, represents our 50% share of ZALTRAP net product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses. Our share of the loss increased in 2012, compared to 2011, due to an increase in commercialization activities in preparation for potential regulatory approvals. Sanofi provides us with an estimate of our share of the profit or loss from commercialization of ZALTRAP for the most recent fiscal quarter. Sanofi's estimates of net products sales and related expenses for such quarter are reconciled to their actual net product sales and related expenses in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our portion of the profit or loss is adjusted accordingly, as necessary.

In 2012, we earned a $50.0 million substantive milestone payment from Sanofi upon FDA approval of ZALTRAP. Sanofi's reimbursement of our ZALTRAP research and development and other expenses decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a decrease in research and development activities and lower costs related to manufacturing ZALTRAP prior to regulatory approval. Recognition of deferred revenue related to the up-front payments from Sanofi increased in 2012 from 2011 due to shortening the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized, effective in the second quarter of 2012. In connection with recognition of deferred revenue related to ZALTRAP, as of December 31, 2012, $11.5 million of the original $105.0 million of up-front payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

In 2012, Sanofi's reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of $181.9 million under our discovery agreement and $183.4 million of development costs under our license agreement, compared to $161.9 million and $137.4 million, respectively, in 2011. The higher reimbursement amount under the discovery agreement in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in our antibody discovery activities. The higher reimbursement of development costs in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased development activities for REGN727.



As it relates to recognition of deferred revenue, in connection with the November 2009 amendment of the discovery agreement, Sanofi has funded $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities. Revenue related to such funding from Sanofi was deferred and is being recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the recognition of the original $85.0 million up-front payment. As of December 31, 2012, $69.2 million of these up-front and other payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

Bayer HealthCare Collaboration Revenue

The collaboration revenue we earned from Bayer HealthCare, as detailed below, consisted primarily of cost-sharing of Regeneron EYLEA development expenses, recognition of substantive milestone payments, and recognition of revenue related to a non-refundable $75.0 million up-front payment received in October 2006, and a $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 (which, for the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive).

Cost-sharing of our global EYLEA development expenses with Bayer HealthCare increased slightly in 2012 compared to 2011. In 2012, we incurred higher costs in connection with regulatory and other development activities, partly offset by lower costs in connection with our Phase 3 VIEW 1 study in wet AMD, which has concluded. In 2012, we earned $15.0 million and $10.0 million substantive milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval, respectively, in Japan for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD. Recognition of deferred revenue related to the up-front and August 2007 milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare decreased in 2012 from the same period in 2011 due to an extension in the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized, effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2012, $36.5 million of these up-front and August 2007 milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, Bayer HealthCare launched EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, and certain other countries. Regeneron's net profit in connection with  commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States is summarized below. Our share of the profit and the Japan royalties we earned from commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States were fully offset by our contractual obligation to reimburse Bayer HealthCare for a portion of the agreed-upon development expenses previously incurred by Bayer HealthCare. Bayer HealthCare provides us with an estimate of our share of the profit or loss from commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States for the most recent fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCare's estimates of net products sales and related expenses for such quarter are reconciled to their actual net product sales and related expenses in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our portion of the profit or loss is adjusted accordingly, as necessary.



Technology Licensing Revenue

In connection with our

VelocImmune

license agreement with Astellas, the $20.0 million non-refundable payment received in the second quarter of 2010 was deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over the ensuing year. In addition, in connection with the amendment and extension of our license agreement with Astellas, in August 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in June 2011. In connection with our

VelocImmune

license agreement with AstraZeneca, which terminated effective as of February 2011, the $20.0 million non-refundable payment received in the first quarter of 2010 was deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably through February 2011. In 2012 and 2011, we recognized $23.6 million and $24.8 million, respectively, of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements.

As of December 31, 2012, $128.1 million of the August 2010 technology licensing payment received from Astellas was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

Contract Research and Other Revenue

Contract research and other revenue in 2011 included $3.6 million recognized in connection with our five-year grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIH's Knockout Mouse Project. As of the end of 2011, no further revenue has been recognized by us in connection with this NIH Grant. In addition, under a June 2009 agreement with Novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of Novartis' canakinumab. In 2012 and 2011, contract research and other revenue included $2.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of royalties from Novartis.

Expenses

Total operating expenses increased to

$920.8 million

in 2012 from

$651.0 million

in 2011. Our average headcount in 2012 increased to 1,827 from 1,568 in 2011, principally in connection with expanding our antibody research and development activities and commercialization activities, primarily for EYLEA in the United States.

Operating expenses in 2012 and 2011 included a total of

$94.2 million

and

$56.1 million

, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock option and restricted stock awards (Non-cash Compensation Expense). The increase in total Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2012 was primarily attributable to the higher fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in December 2011 and 2012 compared to recent prior years.



Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased to

$625.6 million

in 2012 from

$529.5 million

in 2011. The following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses in 2012 and 2011:

(1)

Includes Non-cash Compensation Expense of $48.4 million in 2012 and $29.3 million in 2011.

(2)

Represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, including related payroll and benefits, Non-cash Compensation Expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. Includes Non-cash Compensation Expense of $5.4 million and $3.5 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(3)

Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs EYLEA development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s EYLEA development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Bayer HealthCare provides us with estimated EYLEA development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCare’s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its EYLEA development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly.

Payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount and Non-cash Compensation Expense, as described above. Clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs for clinical studies of our antibody candidates, especially REGN727 and REGN668, and higher costs related to our Phase 3 studies of EYLEA in DME and macular edema following BRVO, partly offset by lower costs related to our Phase 3 VIEW 1 trial of EYLEA in wet AMD, which has concluded. Clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to manufacturing REGN727, certain other antibody candidates, and clinical supplies of EYLEA, partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of ARCALYST. Occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and higher information technology and facility-related costs. Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCare's EYLEA development expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs in connection with Bayer HealthCare's wet AMD development activities, including the VIEW 2 trial, which has concluded.



We prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare's EYLEA development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below:

Drug development and approval in the United States is a multi-step process regulated by the FDA. The process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the submission of an IND to the FDA which, if successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of the potential new drug. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phases 1, 2, and 3. The most significant costs in clinical development are in Phase 3 clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process. Following successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials for a biological product, a BLA must be submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA, and the FDA must approve the BLA prior to commercialization of the drug. It is not uncommon for the FDA to request additional data following its review of a BLA, which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses. We may elect either on our own, or at the request of the FDA, to conduct further studies that are referred to as Phase 3b and 4 studies. Phase 3b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the BLA is under FDA review. These studies are conducted under an IND. Phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. In addition, as discovery research, preclinical development, and clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. We may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product.

There are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. The lengthy process of seeking FDA approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business.

For these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates or additional indications for our marketed products in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to

$210.8 million

in 2012 from

$117.3 million

in 2011 due to higher selling expenses in connection with commercialization of EYLEA, higher headcount, and higher Non-cash Compensation Expense principally for the reason described above. Selling, general, and administrative expenses included $39.3 million and $23.3 million of Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2012 and 2011, respectively.



Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold increased to

$84.5 million

in 2012 from

$4.2 million

in 2011 due primarily to our launch of EYLEA in November 2011. Cost of goods sold primarily consisted of royalties, as well as costs in connection with producing EYLEA and ARCALYST commercial supplies. In addition, in 2012 and 2011, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $17.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. We record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down our inventory to its estimated realizable value if certain batches or units of product do not meet quality specifications or are expected to expire prior to sale.

Other Income and Expense

Investment income decreased to

$2.0 million

in 2012 from

$3.5 million

in 2011 due primarily to lower yields on cash and marketable securities.

Interest expense increased to

$45.3 million

in 2012 from

$21.3 million

in 2011. In October 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes. Total interest expense in 2012 and 2011 associated with these notes, including amortization of the note discount and debt issuance costs, was $29.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a

$335.8 million

income tax benefit, primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The decision to release this valuation allowance was made after we determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized, and was based on the evaluation and weighting of positive and negative evidence, including our achievement of a cumulative three-year income position in the fourth quarter of 2012. In addition, we considered forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. D

ue to our release of this valuation allowance in 2012, starting in 2013 we will record income taxes on our pre-tax income we recognize using an estimated effective tax rate, which is expected to approximate statutory tax rates.

In 2011, we recorded a

$1.1 million

income tax benefit, which consisted primarily of $0.7 million related to tax legislation that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre-2006 research tax credits.

Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010

Net Loss

We reported a net loss of $221.8 million, or $2.45 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to a net loss of $104.5 million, or $1.26 per share (basic and diluted) for 2010. The increase in our net loss in 2011 was principally due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, partly in connection with commercializing EYLEA for wet AMD, and higher research and development expenses.

Revenues

Revenues in 2011 and 2010 consist of the following:



Net Product Sales

Product sales consist of U.S. sales of our two marketed products, EYLEA and ARCALYST. We record product sales net of allowances and accruals for prompt pay discounts, rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs (including Medicaid), product returns, and distribution-related fees.

In November 2011, we received marketing approval from the FDA for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD, at which time product sales commenced. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized as revenue $24.8 million of EYLEA net product sales.

In 2011 and 2010, we recognized as revenue $19.9 million and $25.3 million, respectively, of ARCALYST net product sales. ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS was our first commercialized drug product. ARCALYST net product sales in 2010 included $20.5 million of ARCALYST net product sales made in 2010 and $4.8 million of previously deferred net product sales. We had limited historical returns experience for ARCALYST beginning with initial sales in 2008 through the end of 2009; therefore, ARCALYST net product sales were deferred until the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated. Effective in the first quarter of 2010, we determined that we had accumulated sufficient historical data to reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of ARCALYST, and, as a result, $4.8 million of previously deferred ARCALYST net product sales were recognized as revenue in the first quarter of 2010. The effect of recognizing the previously deferred ARCALYST net product sales revenue was to lower our net loss per share by $0.06 in 2010.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there was no deferred revenue related to net product sales.

Sanofi Collaboration Revenue

The collaboration revenue we earned from Sanofi, as detailed below, consisted primarily of reimbursement for research and development expenses and recognition of revenue related to non-refundable up-front payments of $105.0 million related to the ZALTRAP collaboration and $85.0 million related to the antibody collaboration.

Sanofi's reimbursement of our ZALTRAP expenses increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher costs related to manufacturing ZALTRAP supplies, offset by a decrease in other research and development activities. Effective in 2011, we and Sanofi began equally sharing pre-launch commercialization expenses related to ZALTRAP in accordance with the companies' collaboration agreement. Our share of these expenses was $9.3 million in 2011, which reduced our Sanofi collaboration revenue.

In 2011, Sanofi's reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of $161.9 million under the discovery agreement and $137.4 million of development costs under the license agreement, compared to $137.7 million and $138.3 million, respectively,



in 2010. The higher reimbursement amount under the discovery agreement in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in our antibody discovery activities. The slightly lower reimbursement of development costs in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in development activities related to REGN475, which is currently on clinical hold, offset generally by increases in development activities for other antibody candidates.

Recognition of deferred revenue related to Sanofi's $85.0 million up-front payment and other payments increased in 2011 compared to 2010. In connection with the November 2009 amendment of the discovery agreement, Sanofi committed to fund up to $30.0 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities, of which $28.2 million was received or receivable as of December 31, 2011. Revenue related to such funding from Sanofi is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the recognition of the original $85.0 million up-front payment.

In August 2008, we entered into a separate

VelociGene

agreement with Sanofi. In 2011 and 2010, we recognized $1.6 million in revenue related to this agreement.

Bayer HealthCare Collaboration Revenue

The collaboration revenue we earned from Bayer HealthCare, as detailed below, consisted of cost sharing of Regeneron EYLEA development expenses, substantive performance milestone payments, and recognition of revenue related to a non-refundable $75.0 million up-front payment received in October 2006 and a $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 (which, for the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive).

Cost-sharing of our global EYLEA development expenses with Bayer HealthCare decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to lower clinical development costs in connection with our Phase 3 VIEW 1 trial in wet AMD and our Phase 2 trial in DME. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we earned two $10.0 million substantive milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare for achieving positive 52-week results in the VIEW 1 study and positive 6-month results in the COPERNICUS study. Recognition of deferred revenue related to the up-front and August 2007 milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare decreased in 2011 from 2010 due to an extension of the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized, effective in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Technology Licensing Revenue

In connection with our

VelocImmune

license agreement with Astellas, the $20.0 million non-refundable payment received in the second quarter of 2010 was deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over the ensuing year. In addition, in connection with the amendment and extension of our license agreement with Astellas, in August 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in June 2011. In connection with our

VelocImmune

license agreement with

AstraZeneca, which terminated effective as of February 2011, the $20.0 million non-refundable payment received in the first quarter of 2010 was deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably through February 2011. In 2011 and 2010, we recognized $24.8 million and $40.0 million, respectively, of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements.



Contract Research and Other Revenue

Contract research and other revenue in 2011 and 2010 included $3.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, recognized in connection with our five-year grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIH's Knockout Mouse Project. In addition, under a June 2009 agreement with Novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of Novartis' canakinumab. In 2011 and 2010, contract research and other revenue included $2.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of royalties from Novartis.

Expenses

Total operating expenses increased to $651.0 million in 2011 from $556.5 million in 2010. Our average headcount in 2011 increased to 1,568 from 1,249 in 2010 principally as a result of our expanding research and development activities, which were primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, and 2011 activities in connection with commercializing EYLEA in wet AMD.

Operating expenses in 2011 and 2010 included a total of $56.1 million and $39.9 million, respectively, of Non-cash Compensation Expense. The increase in total Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2011 was primarily attributable to (i) the recognition of higher expense in 2011 in connection with performance-based stock options that we estimate will vest, (ii) the higher fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in December 2010 compared to recent prior years, and (iii) the recognition of higher expense related to grants of restricted stock in December 2010.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased to $529.5 million in 2011 from $489.2 million in 2010. The following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses in 2011 and 2010:

____________________

* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

(1)

Includes Non-cash Compensation Expense of $29.3 million in 2011 and $19.3 million in 2010.

(2)

Represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, including related payroll and benefits, Non-cash Compensation Expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. Includes Non-cash Compensation Expense of $3.5 million in 2011 and $3.0 million in 2010.

(3)

Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs EYLEA development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s EYLEA development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Bayer HealthCare provides us with estimated EYLEA development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCare’s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its EYLEA development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly.



Payroll and benefits increased principally due to increases in employee headcount and Non-cash Compensation Expense for the reasons described above. Clinical trial expenses decreased due primarily to lower costs related to our Phase 3 clinical development program for ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiated uric acid-lowering therapy, our VIEW 1 trial for EYLEA in wet AMD, our Phase 2 trial for EYLEA in DME, and our clinical development program for REGN475, which is currently on clinical hold, partly offset by higher costs related to our Phase 3 VISTA-DME study for EYLEA. Clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to manufacturing supplies of EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and antibody candidates, partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of ARCALYST. Research and other development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs and regulatory submissions for marketing approvals for EYLEA in wet AMD and CRVO, and ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiated uric acid-lowering therapy. Occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and new and expanded leased facilities in Tarrytown, New York. Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCare's EYLEA development expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs related to Bayer HealthCare's VIEW 2 trial in wet AMD, partly offset by higher costs in connection with Bayer HealthCare's Phase 3 VIVID-DME trial.

We prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare's EYLEA development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below:

For the reasons described above under “Research and Development Expenses” for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates or additional indications for our marketed products in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $117.3 million in 2011 from $65.2 million in 2010 due primarily to increases in compensation expense and recruitment costs, principally in connection with higher headcount in 2011, higher commercialization costs primarily in connection with EYLEA for wet AMD, an increase in Non-cash Compensation Expense for the reasons described above, and higher legal expenses in connection with patent-related litigation with Genentech. Selling, general, and administrative expenses included $23.3 million and $17.6 million of Non-cash compensation expense in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold increased to $4.2 million in 2011 from $2.1 million in 2010, due primarily to our launch of EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in November 2011. Cost of goods sold in 2011 and 2010 primarily consisted of royalties and the costs of producing EYLEA and ARCALYST commercial supplies.



Other Income and Expense

Investment income increased to $3.5 million in 2011 from $2.1 million in 2010 due to higher average balances of cash and marketable securities during 2011.

Interest expense increased to $21.3 million in 2011 from $9.1 million in 2010. In October 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes. Total interest expense in 2011 associated with these notes, including amortization of the note discount and debt issuance costs, was $5.4 million. In addition, interest expense includes the imputed interest portion of payments to our landlord to lease laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York, which totaled $15.6 million in 2011 and $9.1 million in 2010. The increase is due to our occupying in February 2011 an additional new building in Tarrytown and, therefore, we began recognizing interest expense on the related payments to our landlord.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

In 2011, we recorded a $1.1 million income tax benefit, which consisted primarily of $0.7 million related to tax legislation that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre-2006 research tax credits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In 2012, we became profitable and began to generate cash from our product sales of EYLEA. From our inception in 1988, we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of our equity securities, private placements of convertible debt, purchases of our equity securities by our collaborators, including Sanofi, revenue earned under our past and present research and development agreements, including our agreements with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare, EYLEA and ARCALYST product revenue, our technology licensing agreements, our past contract manufacturing agreements, and investment income.

Sources and Uses of Cash for the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010

At December 31, 2012, we had

$587.5 million

in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (including

$8.2 million

of restricted cash and marketable securities) compared with

$810.6 million

(including

$7.7 million

of restricted cash and marketable securities) at December 31, 2011 and $626.9 million (including $7.5 million of restricted cash and marketable securities) at December 31, 2010. In connection with our product launch of EYLEA in November 2011, we have offered extended payment terms to our EYLEA customers. As a result, due to the growth of our EYLEA product sales over the past year, our net trade accounts receivable (none of which are past due) have increased to

$593.2 million

at December 31, 2012 from

$28.3 million

at December 31, 2011. During 2012, we collected $326.6 million of EYLEA trade receivables, and we expect such collections to increase next year. As described above, in 2012, we earned and received a $50.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi, and $25.0 million of milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare. We also made a $60.0 million lump-sum payment in the third quarter of 2012, under our Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement with Genentech, when cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA reached $400.0 million.

In October 2011, we completed a private placement of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes and received net proceeds of $391.1 million after deducting the initial purchaser's discount and issuance costs. In connection with the offering of the convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, which had a net cost to us of $23.7 million.

In October 2010, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6,325,000 shares of Common Stock and received net proceeds of $174.8 million. In connection with the July 2010 amendment and extension of our non-exclusive license agreement with Astellas, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment from Astellas in August 2010.

Cash (Used in) Provided by Operations

Net cash used in operations was

$74.6 million

in 2012. Our net income of

$750.3 million

in 2012 included (i) a non-cash tax benefit of

$340.2 million

resulting from the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, as previously described above, (ii) Non-cash Compensation Expense of

$94.2 million

, (iii) depreciation and amortization of

$36.9 million

, (iv) non-cash interest expense of

$22.9 million

, including $21.6 million resulting from the amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs in connection with our convertible senior notes, which were issued in October 2011, and (v) other non-cash charges, including inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $17.0 million.

At December 31, 2012, Sanofi and trade accounts receivable increased by

$590.1 million

, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily due to higher trade accounts receivable in connection with EYLEA product sales, as described above. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by

$52.6 million

, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily due to an increase in capitalized



inventory costs, principally in connection with EYLEA commercial supplies, and an increase in prepaid royalties resulting from the $60.0 million payment we made in the third quarter of 2012, as described above. Our deferred revenue at December 31, 2012 decreased by

$41.1 million

, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily due to amortization of a previously received and deferred $165.0 million payment under our license agreement with Astellas and amortization of previously deferred payments under our Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare collaborations. Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by

$11.0 million

at December 31, 2012, compared to end-of-year 2011, primarily due to higher sales-related deductions in connection with EYLEA and higher expenditures in connection with our expanding commercial and research and development activities, partly offset by lower payroll-related liabilities due to payment of our year-end 2012 employee cash bonuses in 2012, whereas year-end 2011 employee cash bonuses were accrued in 2011 and paid in January 2012.

Net cash used in operations was

$141.7 million

in 2011. Our net loss of

$221.8 million

in 2011 included Non-cash Compensation Expense of

$56.1 million

and depreciation and amortization of

$31.1 million

. At December 31, 2011, Sanofi and trade accounts receivable increased by $21.1 million, compared to end-of-year 2010, primarily due to EYLEA product sales, which commenced in November 2011. Due to the payment terms granted to our customers, our EYLEA product sales in 2011, generally, had not yet been collected as of December 31, 2011. Our deferred revenue at December 31, 2011 decreased by $40.3 million, compared to end-of-year 2010, primarily due to amortization of a previously received and deferred $165.0 million payment under our license agreement with Astellas and amortization of previously deferred payments under our Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare collaborations. Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased $50.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared to end-of-year 2010, primarily in connection with (i) higher payroll-related liabilities, due in part to funding payment of our year-end 2010 employee cash bonuses in 2010 whereas year-end 2011 employee cash bonuses were accrued in 2011 and funded in 2012 and (ii) our expanded levels of activities and expenditures, partly in connection with EYLEA commercialization activities.

Net cash provided by operations was

$99.2 million

in 2010. Our net loss of

$104.5 million

in 2010 included Non-cash Compensation Expense of

$39.9 million

and depreciation and amortization of

$19.7 million

. At December 31, 2010, Sanofi and trade accounts receivable increased by $17.5 million, compared to end-of-year 2009, primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with Sanofi. Our deferred revenue at December 31, 2010 increased by $158.2 million, compared to end-of-year 2009, primarily due to (i) the receipt of the $165.0 million up-front payment from Astellas, as described above, which was deferred, and (ii) Sanofi's funding of $22.9 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us during 2010 to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer facilities, which was deferred and is being recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the original $85.0 million up-front payment received from Sanofi. These increases were partly offset by amortization of previously received deferred payments under our Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare collaborations.

Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was

$81.1 million

in 2012, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of

$128.5 million

in 2011 and net cash used in investing activities of

$437.0 million

in 2010. In 2012 and 2010, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or maturities by

$31.2 million

and

$331.4 million

, respectively. In 2011, sales or maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by

$186.0 million

. Capital expenditures of

$49.3 million

,

$57.2 million

, and

$99.7 million

in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, included costs in connection with expanding our Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facilities and tenant improvement and associated costs related to our leased facilities in Tarrytown, New York.

Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was

$97.6 million

in 2012, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of

$384.2 million

in 2011 and

$243.3 million

in 2010. There was an increase in exercises of employee stock options in 2012 compared to prior years. As a result, proceeds from issuances of Common Stock were

$63.5 million

in 2012 compared to

$43.6 million

in 2011 and $25.8 million in 2010. In addition, payments for employee tax obligations in connection with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted Common Stock were

$163.3 million

in 2012 as compared to

$25.1 million

in 2011 and

$3.8 million

in 2010.

As described above, in October 2011, we completed a private placement of convertible senior notes and entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, and in October 2010, we completed an offering of our Common Stock. Additionally, in 2010, we received

$47.5 million

of tenant improvement reimbursements from our landlord in connection with our Tarrytown facilities, which we are deemed to own in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance.



Fair Value of Marketable Securities

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we held marketable securities whose aggregate fair value totaled $354.9 million and $325.2 million, respectively. The composition of our portfolio of marketable securities on these dates was as follows:

In addition, at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we had $232.6 million and $485.4 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily held in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities.

Our methods for valuing our marketable securities are described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Collaborations with Sanofi

ZALTRAP

(aflibercept)

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to Sanofi U.S.) to collaborate on the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP in all countries other than Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize ZALTRAP. Sanofi made a non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $45.0 million. In January 2005, we and Sanofi amended the collaboration agreement to exclude, from the scope of the collaboration, the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP for intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with this amendment, Sanofi made a $25.0 million non-refundable payment to us. In December 2005, we and Sanofi amended our collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development of ZALTRAP to include Japan. In connection with this amendment, Sanofi agreed to make a $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us, which was received in January 2006.

In August 2012, the FDA approved ZALTRAP Injection for Intravenous Infusion, in combination with FOLFIRI, for patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen, and Sanofi commenced ZALTRAP sales in the United States. We received, and recorded as revenue in 2012, a

$50.0 million

substantive milestone payment from Sanofi upon FDA approval of ZALTRAP. We currently manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of ZALTRAP. In the future, Sanofi is expected to be responsible for manufacturing commercial supplies of ZALTRAP.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and Sanofi share co-promotion rights and profits and losses on sales of ZALTRAP outside of Japan for disease indications included in our collaboration. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of ZALTRAP, subject to certain potential adjustments.



Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed-upon worldwide ZALTRAP development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement, including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supplies, are funded by Sanofi. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of these development expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. In addition, if the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of the $25.0 million payment received in connection with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement. As a result, we expect that, initially, our share of any ZALTRAP profits (including royalties on sales of ZALTRAP in Japan) will be used to reimburse Sanofi for this repayment obligation. In particular, our contingent reimbursement obligation to Sanofi for ZALTRAP was approximately

$415 million

as of December 31, 2012.

Sanofi funded $12.7 million, $16.9 million, and $16.5 million, respectively, of our ZALTRAP development and other costs in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Our share of the loss from commercialization of ZALTRAP, representing our 50% share of ZALTRAP net product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses, was $25.6 million in 2012 and $9.3 million in 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there was a net payable of $2.7 million and $3.7 million to Sanofi in connection with the companies' ZALTRAP collaboration. In addition, the up-front payments from Sanofi of $80.0 million in September 2003 and $25.0 million in January 2006 were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the period during which we expect to perform services. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, we recognized $11.2 million, $9.9 million and $9.9 million per year of revenue, respectively, related to these up-front payments.

Sanofi has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining obligation to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of ZALTRAP development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to ZALTRAP.

Antibodies

In November 2007, we and Sanofi entered into a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement and a License and Collaboration Agreement. In connection with the execution of the discovery agreement in 2007, we received a non-refundable up-front payment of $85.0 million from Sanofi. Pursuant to the collaboration, Sanofi is funding our research to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. In November 2009, we and Sanofi amended these collaboration agreements to expand and extend our antibody collaboration. Under the amended discovery agreement, Sanofi agreed to fund up to $160 million per year of our antibody discovery activities in 2010 through 2017, subject to a one-time option for Sanofi to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing in 2014 if over the prior two years certain specified criteria were not satisfied. In 2010, as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities, Sanofi funded $137.7 million of our preclinical research under the amended discovery agreement. The balance between that amount and $160 million, or $22.3 million, was added to the funding otherwise available to us in 2011-2012 under the amended discovery agreement. The amended discovery agreement will expire on December 31, 2017; however, Sanofi has an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional three years for further antibody development and preclinical activities.

For each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement, Sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement. If it elects to do so, Sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. Under certain defined circumstances, upon exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates, Sanofi must make a $10 million substantive milestone payment to us. Under the license agreement, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by Sanofi, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (called Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs) are shared 80% by Sanofi and 20% by us. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for 50% of development expenses that were fully funded by Sanofi and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products. However, we are not required to apply more than 10% of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing Sanofi for these development costs. In particular, our contingent reimbursement obligation to Sanofi in connection with the companies' antibody collaboration was approximately

$510 million

as of December 31, 2012. If Sanofi does not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the license agreement, we retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug candidate, and Sanofi will receive a royalty on sales, if any.

Sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed under the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such products. The parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (Sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (Sanofi)/45%



(us), and losses outside the United States at 55% (Sanofi)/45% (us). In addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. In connection with the November 2009 amendment of the collaboration's discovery agreement, Sanofi funded $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities.

In 2012, 2011, and 2010, Sanofi funded $181.9 million, $161.9 million, and $137.7 million, respectively, of our expenses under the collaboration's discovery agreement and $183.4 million, $137.4 million, and $138.3 million, respectively, of our development costs under the license agreement. Of these amounts, $100.6 million, $75.6 million, and $73.4 million were included in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The $85.0 million up-front payment received from Sanofi in December 2007 was recorded to deferred revenue and is being recognized as collaboration revenue over the period during which we expect to perform services. In addition, reimbursements by Sanofi of our costs to expand our manufacturing capacity were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized prospectively as collaboration revenue over the same period applicable to recognition of the $85.0 million up-front payment. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, we recognized $8.6 million, $8.2 million, and $7.3 million of revenue, respectively, related to these deferred payments.

In connection with the antibody collaboration, in August 2008, we entered into a separate agreement with Sanofi, which extended through December 2012, to use our proprietary

VelociGene

technology platform to supply Sanofi with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and disease. The agreement provided for minimum annual order quantities for the term of the agreement, for which we expect to receive payments totaling $21.5 million.

With respect to each antibody product which enters development under the license agreement, Sanofi or we may, by giving twelve months notice, opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of the product. We may also opt-out of the further development of an antibody product if we give notice to Sanofi within thirty days of the date that Sanofi elects to jointly develop such antibody product under the license agreement. Each of the discovery agreement and the license agreement contains other termination provisions, including for material breach by the other party. Prior to December 31, 2017, Sanofi has the right to terminate the amended discovery agreement without cause with at least three months advance written notice; however, except under defined circumstances, Sanofi would be obligated to immediately pay to us the full amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the research agreement through December 31, 2017. Upon termination of the collaboration in its entirety, our obligation to reimburse Sanofi for development costs out of any future profits from collaboration products will terminate.

In December 2007, we sold Sanofi 12 million newly issued, unregistered shares of Common Stock at an aggregate cash price of $312.0 million, or $26.00 per share of Common Stock. As a condition to the closing of this transaction, Sanofi entered into an investor agreement with us. This agreement, which was amended in November 2009, contains certain demand rights, “stand-still provisions”, and other restrictions, which are more fully described in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in October 2010, Sanofi purchased 1,017,401 shares of Common Stock in our underwritten public offering.

Collaboration with Bayer HealthCare

In October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare to globally develop, and commercialize outside the United States, EYLEA. Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer HealthCare made a non-refundable up-front payment to us of $75.0 million. In August 2007, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment (which, for the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive) from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in the VIEW 1 study of EYLEA in wet AMD. In 2009, we received a $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in the COPERNICUS study of EYLEA in CRVO. In both December 2010 and January 2011, we received a $10.0 million substantive milestone payment (for a total of $20.0 million) from Bayer HealthCare for achieving positive 52-week results in the VIEW 1 study and positive 6-month results in the COPERNICUS study, respectively. In 2012, we received $15.0 million and $10.0 million milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval, respectively, in Japan for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD, and we are eligible to receive up to $25 million in future substantive milestone payments related to marketing approvals of EYLEA in additional indications in major market countries outside the United States. We are also eligible to receive up to $135 million in sales milestone payments if total annual sales of EYLEA outside the United States achieve certain specified levels starting at $200 million.



In the fourth quarter of 2012, Bayer HealthCare launched EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, and certain other countries. Bayer HealthCare has additional regulatory applications for EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD pending in other countries. In addition, Bayer HealthCare submitted applications for marketing authorization for EYLEA in Europe in December 2012 and in Japan in January 2013 for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO. Bayer HealthCare will market EYLEA outside the United States, where, for countries other than Japan, the companies will share equally in profits and losses from sales of EYLEA. We are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of between 33.5% and 40.0% of EYLEA annual net sales in Japan. We are obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare out of our share of the collaboration profits (including royalties on sales of EYLEA in Japan) for 50% of the agreed-upon development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option. As a result, we expect that, initially, our share of any EYLEA profits outside the United States will be used to reimburse Bayer HealthCare for this repayment obligation. In particular, our contingent reimbursement obligation to Bayer HealthCare for EYLEA was approximately

$273 million

at December 31, 2012. Within the United States, we are responsible for commercialization of EYLEA and retain exclusive rights to all future profits from such commercialization in the United States. We and Bayer HealthCare continue to evaluate EYLEA in Phase 3 programs in patients with DME, macular edema following BRVO, and mCNV of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia.

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial products to Bayer HealthCare.

The $75.0 million up-front payment and the $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 from Bayer HealthCare were recorded to deferred revenue. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, we recognized $7.9 million, $9.4 million, and $9.9 million, respectively, of revenue related to these payments. The $15.0 million and $10.0 million substantive milestone payments received from Bayer HealthCare in 2012 were recognized as collaboration revenue in 2012, and the $10.0 million substantive milestone payments received from Bayer HealthCare in each of December 2010 and January 2011 were recognized as collaboration revenue in 2010.

Under the terms of the agreement, in 2009 and thereafter, all agreed upon EYLEA development expenses incurred by both companies under a global development plan are shared equally. Primarily in connection with sharing development expenses, net amounts received or receivable from Bayer HealthCare were $17.3 million in 2012, and in 2011 and 2010, net amounts paid or payable to Bayer HealthCare were $8.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $2.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively, were receivable from Bayer HealthCare in connection with cost-sharing of EYLEA expenses under the collaboration.

Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least six months or twelve months advance notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, we retain all rights to EYLEA.

License Agreement with Astellas

Under this non-exclusive license agreement, Astellas made a $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payment to us in each of 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007. In July 2010, the license agreement with Astellas was amended and extended through June 2023. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Astellas made a $165.0 million up-front payment to us in August 2010. In addition, Astellas will make a $130.0 million second payment to us in June 2018 unless the license agreement has been terminated prior to that date. Astellas has the right to terminate the agreement at any time by providing 90 days' advance written notice. Under certain limited circumstances, such as our material breach of the agreement, Astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a refund of a portion of its up-front payment or, if such termination occurs after June 2018, a portion of its second payment, to us under the July 2010 amendment to the agreement. We are entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by Astellas using our

VelocImmune

technology.

License Agreement with AstraZeneca

Under this non-exclusive license agreement, AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payment to us in each of 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007. In November 2010, as permitted by the agreement, MedImmune Limited (as successor by novation from AstraZeneca) gave written notice of voluntary termination of the agreement, effective in February 2011. We remain entitled to receive mid-single digit royalties on any future sales of antibody products discovered by MedImmune using our

VelocImmune

technology.



License Agreement with Cellectis

In July 2008, we and Cellectis S.A. entered into an Amended and Restated Non-Exclusive License Agreement. The amended license agreement resolved a dispute between the parties related to the interpretation of a license agreement entered into by the parties in December 2003 pursuant to which we licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to a process for the specific replacement of a copy of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous recombination. Pursuant to the amended license agreement, in July 2008, we made a non-refundable $12.5 million payment to Cellectis and agreed to pay Cellectis a low single-digit royalty based on revenue received by us from any future licenses or sales of our

VelociGene

or

VelocImmune

products and services. No royalties are payable to Cellectis with respect to our

VelocImmune

license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas or our antibody collaboration with Sanofi. In addition, no royalties are payable to Cellectis on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from our

VelocImmune

technology. We are amortizing our $12.5 million payment to Cellectis in proportion to past and anticipated future revenues under our license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas and our antibody discovery agreement with Sanofi (as amended in November 2009).

License and Partial Settlement Agreement with Genentech

In December 2011, we and Genentech entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to certain patents relating to VEGF receptor proteins, known as the Davis-Smyth patents, and other technology patents. The Davis-Smyth patents are the subject of patent litigation between us and Genentech now pending in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. Patent litigation is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the Genentech Agreement (see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”).

Under the terms of the agreement with Genentech, we agreed to make payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA commencing upon FDA approval of EYLEA in November 2011 through May 7, 2016. In 2012, we made a one-time, non-refundable $60.0 million payment when cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA reached $400 million. In addition, we agreed to pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on any cumulative U.S sales of EYLEA over $3 billion. As we record net product sales of EYLEA, we are recognizing expense in connection with the Genentech Agreement using a blended mid-single digit royalty rate that reflects both the $60 million payment and the royalties payable on cumulative sales and that is based upon our estimate of cumulative EYLEA sales through May 7, 2016.

Lease - Tarrytown, New York Facilities

We lease approximately 561,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at facilities in Tarrytown, New York, under a December 2006 lease agreement, as amended. These facilities include approximately 230,000 square feet of space in two newly constructed buildings (Buildings A and B) that were completed during the third quarter of 2009 and approximately 131,000 square feet of additional space in a third newly constructed building (Building C), that was completed in early 2011. The lease will expire in June 2024 and contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each, as well as early termination options on approximately 331,000 square feet of space. The lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses. In connection with the lease, we have issued a $3.4 million letter of credit to our landlord, which is fully collateralized by cash and marketable securities.

Certain premises under the lease are accounted for as operating leases. However, for Buildings A, B, and C that we are leasing, we are deemed, in substance, to be the owner of the landlord's buildings in accordance with the application of FASB authoritative guidance. As a result, we capitalized the landlord's costs of constructing these new facilities and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation. We also recognized, as additional facility lease obligation, reimbursements from our landlord for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since, under FASB authoritative guidance, such payments that we receive from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation. Monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated between the land element of the lease (which is accounted for as an operating lease) and the facility lease obligation, which was based on the initial estimated relative fair values of the land and buildings.

As of December 31, 2010, we had capitalized the landlord's costs of constructing Buildings A and B, which totaled $58.4 million, and of constructing Building C, which totaled $27.8 million. Reimbursements from our landlord for Buildings A and B tenant improvement costs totaled $56.9 million and were received by us during 2010 and 2009. Reimbursements for Building C tenant improvement costs totaled $14.2 million and were received by us during 2010. With respect to Buildings A and B, monthly lease payments commenced in August 2009, the buildings were placed in service by us in September 2009, and the imputed interest rate applicable to our facility lease obligation is approximately 11%. With respect to Building C, monthly lease payments commenced in January 2011, the building was placed in service by us in February 2011, and the imputed interest rate applicable to our facility lease obligation is approximately 9%. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Buildings A and B facility lease obligation



balance was $112.0 million and $113.0 million, respectively, and the Building C facility lease obligation balance was $48.8 million and $47.5 million, respectively.

Capital Expenditures

Our cash expenditures for property, plant, and equipment totaled

$49.3 million

in 2012,

$57.2 million

in 2011, and

$99.7 million

in 2010. We received

$47.5 million

in 2010 from our landlord in connection with tenant improvement costs in Buildings A, B and C in Tarrytown, as described above. In addition, in connection with our antibody collaboration with Sanofi, Sanofi funded $1.5 million in 2012, $4.8 million in 2011, and $22.9 million in 2010 of agreed-upon capital expenditures incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer facilities.

We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $80 to $100 million in 2013 primarily in connection with expanding our manufacturing facilities for the production of antibodies, tenant improvements at our leased Tarrytown facilities, and purchases of equipment.

Offering of Convertible Senior Notes

In October 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes in a private placement. The notes were offered by the initial purchaser only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.

The notes pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, and will mature on October 1, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at our option. The initial conversion rate for the notes will be 11.9021 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, or a total of approximately

4,760,840

shares upon conversion, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $84.02 per share. A holder of the notes may surrender their notes at their option any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 1, 2016, only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2011 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price, as defined, of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we elect to issue to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock any rights, options, or warrants (other than pursuant to a rights plan) entitling them for a period of not more than 60 calendar days after the record date for such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of our Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the last reported sales prices of our Common Stock for the ten consecutive day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance; (iv) upon specified distributions to our shareholders; or (v) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a fundamental change (i.e., a change in control), or our Common Stock ceasing to be listed on at least one U.S. national securities exchange.

On or after July 1, 2016, holders may convert their notes at the conversion rate at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date irrespective of the foregoing conditions.

In the event that a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture under which the notes have been issued, occurs prior to maturity of the notes, the initial conversion rate may be increased to include additional shares upon conversion, or holders can require us to purchase from them all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Based on the reported sales prices of our Common Stock, the Notes were able to be converted by holders as of December 31, 2012.

In connection with the offering of the convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedge (call option) and warrant transactions with multiple counterparties, including an affiliate of the initial purchaser. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our Common Stock that initially underlie the notes, and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the notes. The convertible note hedge will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day the notes are no longer outstanding. The warrant transactions have an initial strike price of approximately $103.41 per share, and may be settled in cash or shares of our Common Stock, at our option. The warrants expire at various dates during 2017.

The net proceeds from the convertible senior notes offering were $391.1 million after deducting the initial purchaser's discount and issuance costs. In addition, the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, after taking into account the proceeds received by us from the warrant transactions, was $23.7 million.



Funding Requirements

We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical testing), commercialization of EYLEA and ZALTRAP, and capital expenditures. We believe that our existing capital resources, funds generated by anticipated EYLEA net product sales, and funding for reimbursement of development costs that we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements will enable us to meet our projected operating needs for the foreseeable future. As described above, research and development expenses that we incur in connection with our ZALTRAP and antibodies collaborations are generally funded by Sanofi. In addition, as described above, we and Bayer HealthCare share agreed-upon development expenses that both companies incur in connection with our EYLEA collaboration.

In connection with our funding requirements, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012. These obligations and commitments assume non-termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:

_________

(1)

Consists of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes that mature on October 1, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The amounts in the table above assume the payment of interest on our convertible senior notes through their maturity date and the payment of the principal amount of the notes at their maturity date. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. The convertible senior notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at our option. As of December 31, 2012, the convertible senior notes were convertible under the terms of the notes.

(2)

Excludes future contingent costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. In 2012, these costs were $10.9 million. See Note 13(a) to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Purchase obligations primarily relate to (i) research and development commitments, including those related to clinical trials, (ii) capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions, and (iii) license payments. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events. Open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above.

(4)

Represents payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of facilities in Tarrytown, New York, as described above. See Note 13(a) to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, over the next several years we and Bayer HealthCare will share agreed-upon EYLEA development expenses incurred by both companies, under a global development plan, as described above. In addition, under our collaboration agreements with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare, we and our collaborator will share profits and losses in connection with commercialization of drug products. Profits or losses under each collaboration are measured by calculating net sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses. If the applicable collaboration becomes profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development expenses incurred by Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare, respectively. These reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits (and, for our ZALTRAP collaboration with Sanofi and our Bayer HealthCare collaboration, royalties on product sales in Japan) otherwise payable to us, unless, in some cases, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate. In particular, as of December 31, 2012, our reimbursement obligation to Sanofi for ZALTRAP was approximately

$415 million

, while our reimbursement obligation to Bayer HealthCare for EYLEA was approximately

$273 million

. Therefore, we expect that, initially, our share of profits from sales of ZALTRAP, and a portion of our share of profits from sales of EYLEA outside the United States, will be used to reimburse our collaborators for these obligations.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors, including revenues from net product sales, the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products, and the timing thereof, the status of competitive products, the success of our research and development programs, the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual property rights (and pending



or future litigation related thereto), the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations with Sanofi and Bayer HealthCare. Clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above. Our commercialization costs over the next few years will depend on, among other things, whether or not new indications for our marketed products or our antibody product candidates in later stage clinical development receive regulatory approval, the market potential for such new indications or product candidates, and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements, if applicable (whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators). Currently, we are required to pay royalties on sales of our commercial products. In the future, if we are able to successfully develop, market, and sell EYLEA for other indications, or certain of our product candidates, we may be required to pay additional royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements.

As described above, in 2012, 2011, and 2010, we made cash payments of

$163.3 million

,

$25.1 million

, and

$3.8 million

, respectively, for employee tax obligations in connection with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock. Future cash requirements  for such payments will depend on various factors, including the level of stock option grants and exercises and the sales prices of our Common Stock, and may continue to be substantial.

We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will continue to be substantial.

Due to the amounts of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards available for tax purposes, which totaled

$876.6 million

and

$71.2 million

, respectively, at December 31, 2012, we do not anticipate incurring substantive cash obligations for federal and state corporate income taxes in the near future.

In connection with our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, we are entitled to receive milestone payments related to marketing and pricing approvals of EYLEA in major market countries outside the United States, as well as sales milestones based on total annual sales of EYLEA outside the United States achieving certain specified levels. Under the terms of our ZALTRAP collaboration agreement with Sanofi, we are also entitled to receive milestone payments upon receipt of additional specified marketing approvals.

Other than letters of credits totaling $4.6 million as of December 31, 2012, including a $3.4 million letter of credit issued in connection with our lease for facilities in Tarrytown, New York, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity. As of December 31, 2012, we had no other established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing or a line of credit. In October 2011, we completed a private placement of convertible senior notes. In addition, in October 2010, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 registering the sale, in one or more offerings, of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities, together or separately, and our October 2010 public offering of approximately 6.3 million shares of Common Stock was completed under this shelf registration statement. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete any additional offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development and commercialization, investor perception of our prospects, and the general condition of the financial markets. We may not be able to secure additional funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings. If we require additional funding, and cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations. This could materially harm our business.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates, principally in connection with our investments in marketable securities, which consist primarily of direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, and other debt securities guaranteed by the U.S. government. We do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We estimate that a 100 basis point, or 1%, unfavorable change in interest rates would have resulted in approximately a $4.9 million and $3.3 million decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in interest rate risk year over year is due primarily to higher balances of marketable debt securities that we held at December 31, 2012 compared to the same period of 2011.



Credit Quality Risk

We have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and diversification. Nonetheless, deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, other-than-temporary impairment charges recognized by us, if any, were inconsequential.

We are also subject to credit risk in connection with accounts receivable from our product sales of EYLEA and ARCALYST. These accounts receivable are due from three distributors and several specialty pharmacies, who are our customers. We have contractual payment terms with each of our customers, and we monitor our customers' financial performance and credit worthiness so that we can properly assess and respond to any changes in their credit profile. In addition, we may insure a portion of our accounts receivables within our overall risk management practices. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, we did not recognize any charges for write-offs of accounts receivable related to our marketed products. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, one individual customer accounted for 80% and 71%, respectively, of our net trade accounts receivable balances.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company's management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 using the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 15.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or deviations, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (the “Company”), at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1. Organization and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Regeneron”) is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. The Company currently has three marketed products as follows:

•

EYLEA

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and the balance sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

Marketable Securities

The Company has an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and diversification. The Company has invested its excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, other debt securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, and money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. The Company considers its marketable securities to be “available-for-sale,” as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). These assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If the decline in the value of a marketable security in the Company's investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the security to its current fair value and recognizes a loss as a charge against income. As described under “Use of Estimates” below, the Company reviews its portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

In computing realized gains and losses, the Company computes the cost of its investments on a specific identification basis. Such cost includes the direct costs to acquire the security, adjusted for the amortization of any discount or premium.

Accounts Receivable - Trade

The Company's trade accounts receivable represents amounts due from its distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively, the Company's “customers”), which are all located in the United States. The Company monitors the financial performance and credit worthiness of its large customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from a customer's inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the reserve. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no reserves against trade accounts receivable. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, no trade accounts receivable were written-off.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. The Company determines the cost of inventory using the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with the Company's products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed as research and development. The Company periodically analyzes its inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and writes-down such inventories as appropriate. In addition, the Company's products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which the Company performs throughout the manufacturing process. If certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term, without assuming renewal features, if any, are exercised. Costs of construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is determined to exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount.

Patents

As a result of the Company's research and development efforts, the Company obtains and applies for patents to protect proprietary technology and inventions. All costs associated with patents for product candidates under development are expensed as incurred. Patent costs related to commercial products are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining patent term. To date, the Company has no capitalized patent costs.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Operating Leases

On certain of its operating lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of required payments. In addition, lease incentives that the Company receives are treated as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the related agreements.

Revenue Recognition

a. Product Revenue

Product sales consist of U.S. sales of EYLEA and ARCALYST. Revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, the Company has no further performance obligations, and returns can be reasonably estimated. The Company's written contracts with its customers stipulate product is shipped freight on board destination (FOB destination). The Company records revenue from product sales upon delivery to its customers.

The Company sells EYLEA

in the United States to three distributors and several specialty pharmacies. The Company sells ARCALYST in the United States to two specialty pharmacies. Under these distribution models, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product. For EYLEA, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers, whereas for ARCALYST, the specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients.

Revenue from product sales is recorded net of applicable provisions for rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs (including Medicaid), distribution-related fees, prompt pay discounts, product returns, and other sales-related deductions. Calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments. The Company reviews its estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable provisions each period and records any necessary adjustments in the current period's net product sales.

Government Rebates and Chargebacks:

The Company estimates reductions to product sales for Medicaid and Veterans' Administration ("VA") programs, and for certain other qualifying federal and state government programs. Based upon the Company's contracts with government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, and, in the case of EYLEA, estimated payer mix based on third-party market research data, the Company estimates and records an allowance for rebates and chargebacks. The Company's liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for a current quarter, claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received, and invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid. The Company's reserves related to discounted pricing offered to VA, Public Health Services ("PHS"), and other institutions (collectively, “qualified healthcare providers”) represent the Company's estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices the Company charges to its customers (i.e., distributors and specialty pharmacies). The Company's customers charge the Company for the difference between what they pay for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. The Company's reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already claimed.

Distribution-Related Fees:

The Company has written contracts with its customers that include terms for distribution-related fees. The Company estimates and records distribution and related fees due to its customers based on gross sales.

Prompt Pay Discounts:

No prompt pay discounts are currently offered to the Company's customers on sales of EYLEA. In connection with sales of ARCALYST, the Company offers discounts to its customers for prompt payments. The Company estimates these discounts based on customer terms and historical experience, and expects that its customers will always take advantage of this discount. Therefore, the Company accrues

100%

of the prompt pay discount that is based on the gross amount of each ARCALYST

invoice, at the time of sale.

Product Returns:

Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers its customers a limited right to return product purchased directly from the Company, which is principally based upon the product's expiration date. The Company will accept returns for three months prior to and up to six months after the product expiration date. Product returned is generally not resalable given the nature of the Company's products and method of administration. The Company develops estimates for product returns based upon historical experience, inventory levels in the distribution channel, shelf life of the product, and other relevant factors. The Company

F-10


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

monitors product supply levels in the distribution channel, as well as sales by its customers of EYLEA to healthcare providers and ARCALYST to patients using product-specific data provided by its customers. If necessary, the Company's estimates of product returns may be adjusted in the future based on actual returns experience, known or expected changes in the marketplace, or other factors.

b. Collaboration Revenue

The Company earns collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize the Company's technology platforms. The terms of these agreements typically include non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress (milestone) payments, payments for development activities, and sharing of profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products. Non-refundable up-front license payments, where continuing involvement is required of the Company, are deferred and recognized over the related performance period. The Company estimates its performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement, and adjusts the performance periods, if appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances. Although the Company did not enter into, or materially modify, any collaboration arrangements with multiple-deliverables during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, any future arrangements with multiple deliverables will be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria, including whether the delivered item or items has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis.

Payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone. Substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the related product candidate, such as completion of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies, and receipt of approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, the Company takes into consideration (i) the enhancement in value to the related development product candidate, (ii) the Company's performance and relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, (iii) whether the milestone relates solely to past performance, and (iv) whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms. Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related performance period.

The Company enters into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities. The Company may

share the costs of research and development activities with a collaborator, such as in the Company's EYLEA collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, or the Company may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of the Company's research and development activities, such as in the Company's ZALTRAP and antibody collaborations with Sanofi. The Company records its internal and third-party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses. When the Company is entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that it incurs under a collaboration, the Company records those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as the Company recognizes its expenses. If the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both the Company and its collaborator perform development work and share costs, in periods when the Company's collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, the Company also recognizes, as additional research and development expense, the portion of the collaborator's development expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse.

The Company may also be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply commercial product to its collaborators. In such cases, the Company is reimbursed for its manufacturing costs as commercial product is shipped to its collaborators; however, recognition of such cost reimbursements as collaboration revenue is deferred until the product is sold by the Company's collaborators to third-party customers, at which time the Company's risk of inventory loss no longer exists. In addition, at that time, the related manufacturing costs for the sold product, which had been capitalized into inventory, are recognized by the Company.

Under the Company's collaboration agreements, product sales and cost of sales are recorded by the Company's collaborators. The Company shares in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of collaboration products. The Company records its share of the profits or losses, representing net product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses, from commercialization of such products as collaboration revenue.

In connection with non-refundable licensing payments, the Company's performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of its research and development activities. Due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period

F-11


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In addition, estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays, or the Company and its collaborators decide to expand or contract the clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications. Also, if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Company would recognize as revenue any unamortized remainder of an up-front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination.

c.

VelocImmune

®

Technology Licensing

The Company enters into non-exclusive license agreements with third parties that allow the third party to utilize the Company's

VelocImmune

technology in its internal research programs. The terms of these agreements include up-front payments and entitle the Company to receive royalties on any future sales of products discovered by the third party using the Company's

VelocImmune

technology. Up-front payments under these agreements, where continuing involvement is required of the Company, are deferred and recognized ratably over their respective license periods.

Investment Income

Interest income, which is included in investment income, is recognized as earned.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of research and development programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research collaboration and licensing agreements, the cost of services provided by outside contractors, including services related to the Company's clinical trials, clinical trial expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, amounts that the Company is obligated to reimburse to collaborators for research and development expenses that they incur, and the allocable portions of facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All costs associated with research and development are expensed.

Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors. The Company outsources a substantial portion of its clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as contract research organizations (“CROs”), independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist the Company with the execution of its clinical studies. For each clinical trial that the Company conducts, certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and/or the period over which clinical investigators or CROs are expected to provide services.

Clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage the Company's clinical trials are performed primarily by CROs. CROs typically perform most of the start-up activities for the Company's trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management. On a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically

10%

to

20%

of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly wider, as many of the Company's contracts with CROs are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change materially. These start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. In the event of early termination of a clinical trial, the Company accrues and recognizes expenses in an amount based on its estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or penalties.

For clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, the Company accrues expenses on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study. Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years. During the course of a trial, the Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from the Company's estimates. The Company's estimates and

F-12


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from its actual results, which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known.

Stock-based Compensation

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan to employees and non-employee members of the Company's board of directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award's requisite service period. In addition, the Company has granted performance-based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant date, related to these performance options will be recognized only if, and when, the Company estimates that these options will vest, which is based on whether the Company considers the options' performance conditions to be probable of attainment. The Company's estimates of the number of performance-based options that will vest will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of the Company's Common Stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of the board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on the Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates. Stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. This estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts (“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance, which prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Those positions, for which management's assessment is that there is more than a

50%

probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to certain measurement criteria.

The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Per Share Data

Net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock outstanding. Net income (loss) per share is presented on a combined basis, inclusive of Common Stock and Class A Stock outstanding, as each class of stock has equivalent economic rights. Basic net income (loss) per share excludes restricted stock awards until vested. Diluted net income per share includes the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents as if such securities were converted or exercised during the period, when the effect is dilutive. Common stock equivalents include: (i) outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plans, which are included under the “treasury stock method” when dilutive, (ii) Common Stock to be issued upon the assumed conversion of the Company's convertible senior notes, which are included under the “if-converted method” when dilutive, and (iii) Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, which are included under the “treasury stock method” when dilutive. The computation of diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 does not include common stock equivalents, since such inclusion would be antidilutive.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regeneron and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities (see Note 6), and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from product sales of EYLEA and ARCALYST are due from three distributors and several specialty pharmacies, who are the Company's customers. The Company has contractual payment terms with each of its customers, and the Company monitors its customers' financial performance and credit worthiness so that it can properly assess and respond to any changes in their credit profile. In addition, the Company may insure a portion of its accounts receivables within its overall risk management practices. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company did not recognize any charges for write-offs of accounts receivable related to its marketed products.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates which could have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements include:

•

Product rebates, chargebacks, distribution-related fees, and returns in connection with the recognition of product sales revenue.

•

Periods over which payments, including non-refundable up-front, license, and milestone payments, are recognized as revenue in connection with collaboration and other agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize the Company's technology platforms.

•

Periods over which certain clinical trial costs, including costs for clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, are recognized as research and development expenses.

•

In connection with the recognition of expense, using a blended royalty rate, related to the Company's non-exclusive license with Genentech, Inc., the Company's estimate of cumulative EYLEA sales through May 7, 2016 (see Note 13b).

•

In connection with stock option awards, (i) the fair value of stock options on their date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on assumptions with respect to (a) expected volatility of the Company's Common Stock price, (b) the periods of time for which employees and members of the Company's board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (c) expected dividend yield on the Company's Common Stock, and (d) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives; (ii) the number of stock option awards that are expected to be forfeited; and (iii) with respect to performance-based stock option awards, if and when the options' performance conditions are considered to be probable of attainment.

•

The Company's determination of whether marketable securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company conducts a review of its portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine, for securities whose current fair value is less than their cost, whether the decline in fair value below cost is other-than-temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers factors such as the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. This review process also includes an evaluation of the Company's ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature or their full value can be recovered. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment.

•

Useful lives of property, plant, and equipment.

•

Inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, which is written-down, as appropriate. In addition, capitalization of inventory costs associated with the Company's products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized.

•

The extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset by a valuation allowance.

These estimates for the most recent fiscal quarter are adjusted, if necessary, in the subsequent quarter to reflect actual amounts for the quarter.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Presentation of comprehensive income

In June and December 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Under the amendments, an entity has the option to present comprehensive income and net income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. This amendment, therefore, eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The amendment did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The Company adopted this amended guidance for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012. As this guidance relates to presentation only, the adoption of this guidance did not have any other effect on the Company's financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform with the current period's presentation.

3. Net Product Sales

In November 2011, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA for EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection for the treatment of wet AMD. In September 2012, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA for EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO. EYLEA net product sales totaled

$837.9 million

and

$24.8 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and 2011, respectively.

In February 2008, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA for ARCALYST Injection for Subcutaneous Use for the treatment of CAPS. ARCALYST net product sales totaled

$20.2 million

,

$19.9 million

, and

$25.3 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2012

, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The Company had limited historical returns experience for ARCALYST beginning with initial sales in 2008 through the end of 2009; therefore, ARCALYST net product sales were deferred until the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated. Effective in the first quarter of 2010, the Company determined that it had accumulated sufficient historical data to reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of ARCALYST. As a result, ARCALYST net product sales during 2010 included

$20.5 million

of net product sales made during this period and

$4.8 million

of previously deferred net product sales. The effect of recognizing the previously deferred ARCALYST net product sales revenue was to lower the Company's net loss per share by

$0.06

in 2010.

For the years ended

December 31, 2012

and 2011, the Company recorded

78%

and

In September 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “ZALTRAP

Agreement”) with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to Sanofi U.S.), to jointly develop and commercialize ZALTRAP. In connection with this agreement, Sanofi made a non-refundable up-front payment of

$80.0 million

and purchased

2,799,552

newly issued unregistered shares of the Company's Common Stock for

$45.0 million

. In January 2005, the Company and Sanofi amended the ZALTRAP Agreement to exclude intraocular delivery of aflibercept to the eye (“Intraocular Delivery”) from joint development under the agreement, and product rights to aflibercept in Intraocular Delivery reverted to Regeneron. In connection with this amendment, Sanofi made a

$25.0 million

non-refundable payment to Regeneron (the “Intraocular Termination Payment”). In December 2005, the Company and Sanofi amended the ZALTRAP Agreement to expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development of ZALTRAP to include Japan. In connection with this amendment, Sanofi agreed to make a

$25.0 million

non-refundable up-front payment to the Company, which was received in January 2006.

In August 2012, the FDA approved ZALTRAP Injection for Intravenous Infusion, in combination with FOLFIRI, for patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen, and Sanofi commenced ZALTRAP sales in the United States. The Company earned, and recorded as revenue in 2012, a

$50.0 million

substantive milestone payment from Sanofi upon FDA approval of ZALTRAP. The Company currently manufactures clinical and commercial supplies of ZALTRAP.

Under the ZALTRAP Agreement, as amended, the Company and Sanofi share co-promotion rights and profits and losses on sales of ZALTRAP outside of Japan, for disease indications included in the companies' collaboration. The Company is entitled to a royalty of approximately

35%

on annual sales of ZALTRAP in Japan, subject to certain potential adjustments. According to the terms of the ZALTRAP Agreement, the Company may also receive up to

$350 million

in additional substantive milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals, including up to

$310 million

in milestone payments related to the receipt of marketing

approvals for up to

seven

ZALTRAP oncology and other indications in the United States or the European Union and up to

$40 million

related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to

five

ZALTRAP oncology indications in Japan.

Under the ZALTRAP Agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by Sanofi. If the collaboration becomes profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for

50%

of these development expenses, in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and Regeneron's share of the collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at Regeneron's option. In connection with the January 2005 amendment to the ZALTRAP Agreement, the Intraocular Termination Payment of

$25.0 million

will also be subject to

50%

reimbursement by Regeneron to Sanofi if the collaboration becomes profitable. In particular, the Company's total contingent reimbursement obligation to Sanofi for ZALTRAP was approximately

$415 million

as of December 31, 2012.Regeneron has the option to conduct additional pre-Phase III studies at its own expense.

Sanofi has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least

twelve

months advance notice. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason, Regeneron's obligation to reimburse Sanofi for

50%

of ZALTRAP development expenses will terminate, and the Company will retain all rights to ZALTRAP.

In accordance with the Company's revenue recognition policy described in Note 2, the up-front payments received in September 2003 and January 2006, of

$80.0 million

and

$25.0 million

, respectively, and reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred development expenses, are being recognized as collaboration revenue over the related performance period.

The collaboration revenue related to ZALTRAP that the Company earned from Sanofi is detailed below:

In connection with the ZALTRAP Agreement, (i) at December 31, 2012 and 2011, there was a net payable of

$2.7 million

and

$3.7 million

, respectively, to Sanofi, and (ii) deferred revenue at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was

$14.8 million

and

$22.9 million

, respectively.

Antibodies

In November 2007, the Company entered into a global, strategic collaboration (the “Antibody Collaboration”) with Sanofi to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies

.

In connection with the collaboration, in December 2007, Sanofi purchased

12 million

newly issued, unregistered shares of the Company's Common Stock for

$312.0 million

(see Note 14).

The Antibody Collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement (the “Discovery Agreement”) and a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “License Agreement”). In connection with the execution of the Discovery Agreement in 2007, the Company received a non-refundable up-front payment of

$85.0 million

from Sanofi. In addition, under the Discovery Agreement, Sanofi is funding the Company's research to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. In November 2009, the Company and Sanofi amended these collaboration agreements to expand and extend the Antibody Collaboration. Pursuant to the Discovery Agreement, as amended, Sanofi agreed to fund up to

$160 million

per year of the Company's research activities in 2010 through 2017, subject to a one-time option for Sanofi to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to

$120 million

per year commencing in 2014 if over the prior two years certain specified criteria were not satisfied. In 2010, as the Company scaled up its capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities, Sanofi funded

$137.7 million

of the Company's preclinical research under the amended Discovery Agreement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

The balance between that amount and

$160 million

, or

$22.3 million

, was added to the funding otherwise available to the Company in 2011-2012 under the amended Discovery Agreement. The amended Discovery Agreement will expire on December 31, 2017; however, Sanofi has an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional three years for further antibody development and preclinical activities.

For each drug candidate identified under the Discovery Agreement, Sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the License Agreement. If it elects to do so, Sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with the Company through product approval. Under certain defined circumstances, upon exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates, Sanofi must make a

$10 million

substantive milestone payment to the Company. If Sanofi does not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the License Agreement, the Company retains the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug candidate, and Sanofi will receive a royalty on sales, if any. The Company and Sanofi are currently co-developing

six

therapeutic antibodies under the License Agreement.

Under the License Agreement, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by Sanofi, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (“Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs”) are shared

80%

by Sanofi and

20%

by Regeneron. If the Antibody Collaboration becomes profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to reimburse Sanofi for

50%

of development expenses that were fully funded by Sanofi and

30%

of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and the Company's share of collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products. However, the Company is not required to apply more than

10%

of its share of the profits from the antibody collaboration in any calendar quarter to reimburse Sanofi for these development costs. In particular, the Company's contingent reimbursement obligation to Sanofi was approximately

$510 million

as of December 31, 2012.

Sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed under the License Agreement, subject to the Company's right to co-promote such products. The parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at

65%

(Sanofi)/

35%

(Regeneron) and ending at

55%

(Sanofi)/

45%

(Regeneron), and losses outside the United States at

55%

(Sanofi)/

45%

(Regeneron). In addition to profit sharing, the Company is entitled to receive up to

$250 million

in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed

$1.0 billion

on a rolling


-month basis.

Regeneron is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the Antibody Collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. In connection with the November 2009 amendment of the collaboration's Discovery Agreement, Sanofi funded

$30.0 million

of agreed-upon costs the Company incurred to expand its manufacturing capacity at its Rensselaer, New York facilities.

With respect to each antibody product which enters development under the License Agreement, Sanofi or the Company may, by giving

twelve

months notice, opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of the product. The Company may also opt-out of the further development of an antibody product if it gives notice to Sanofi within

thirty

days of the date that Sanofi enters joint development of such antibody product under the License Agreement. Each of the Discovery Agreement and the License Agreement contains other termination provisions, including for material breach by the other party. Prior to December 31, 2017, Sanofi has the right to terminate the amended Discovery Agreement without cause with at least three months advance written notice; however, except under defined circumstances, Sanofi would be obligated to immediately pay to the Company the full amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the research agreement through December 31, 2017. Upon termination of the collaboration in its entirety, the Company's obligation to reimburse Sanofi for development costs out of any future profits from collaboration products will terminate. Upon expiration of the amended Discovery Agreement, Sanofi has an option to license the Company's

VelocImmune

technology for agreed upon consideration.

In connection with the Antibody Collaboration, in August 2008, the Company entered into a separate agreement with Sanofi, which extended through December 2012, to use Regeneron's proprietary

VelociGene

®

technology platform to supply Sanofi with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and disease (the “

VelociGene

Agreement”)

.

The

VelociGene

Agreement provided for minimum annual order quantities for the term of the agreement, for which the Company expects to receive payments totaling

$21.5 million

.

$135 million

in sales milestone payments when and if total annual sales of EYLEA outside the United States achieve certain specified levels starting at

$200 million

.

Sales of EYLEA commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, and certain other countries. Bayer HealthCare will market EYLEA outside the United States, where, for countries other than Japan, the Company and Bayer HealthCare will share equally in profits and losses from sales of EYLEA. The Company is entitled to a tiered royalty of between 33.5% and 40.0% of EYLEA annual sales in Japan. The Company is obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare out of its share of the collaboration profits (including royalties on sales of EYLEA in Japan) for

50%

of the agreed upon development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred and the Company's share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at the Company's option. In particular, the Company's contingent reimbursement obligation to Bayer HealthCare was approximately

$273 million

as of December 31, 2012. Within the United States, the Company is responsible for commercialization of EYLEA and retains exclusive rights to all profits from such commercialization in the United States.

Starting in 2009, all agreed upon EYLEA development expenses incurred by the Company and Bayer HealthCare, under a global development plan, are being shared equally. The Company is also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial product requirements.

Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate the Bayer Agreement without cause with at least

six months or twelve months

advance notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, the Company retains all rights to EYLEA.

The

$75.0 million

up-front licensing payment and the

$20.0 million

milestone payment received in August 2007 from Bayer HealthCare are being recognized as collaboration revenue over the related estimated performance period in accordance with the Company's revenue recognition policy as described in Note 2. In periods when the Company recognizes EYLEA development expenses that the Company incurs under the collaboration, the Company also recognizes, as collaboration revenue, the portion of those EYLEA development expenses that is reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs agreed upon EYLEA development expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, the Company also recognizes, as additional research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare's EYLEA development expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse.

calendar days after the record date for such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the last reported sales prices of the Company's Common Stock for the

ten

consecutive day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance; (iv) upon specified distributions to the Company's shareholders; or (v) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a fundamental change (i.e., a change in control), or the Company's Common Stock ceasing to be listed on at least one U.S. national securities exchange. On or after July 1, 2016, holders may convert their Notes at the conversion rate at any time prior to the close of business on the second

scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date irrespective of the foregoing conditions. In the event that a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture under which the Notes have been issued, occurs prior to maturity of the Notes, the initial conversion rate may be increased to include additional shares upon conversion, or holders can require the Company to purchase from them all or a portion of their Notes for

100%

of the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Based on the reported sales prices of the Company's Common Stock, the Notes were able to be converted by holders as of December 31, 2012.

The Company has reserved sufficient shares of its Common Stock to satisfy the conversion requirements related to the Notes. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity date.

As of December 31, 2012, the "if converted value" exceeded the principal amount of the Notes by

$414.4 million

.

In accordance with accounting guidance for debt with conversion and other options, the Company accounted for the liability and equity components of the Notes separately. The estimated fair value of the liability component at the date of issuance was

$271.1 million

, and was computed based on the fair value of similar debt instruments that do not include a conversion feature. The equity component of

$120.9 million

was recognized as a debt discount and represents the difference between the

$392.0 million

of gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and the

$271.1 million

estimated fair value of the liability component at the date of issuance. The debt discount is amortized over the expected life of a similar liability without the equity component. The Company determined this expected life to be equal to the term of the Notes, resulting in an amortization period ending October 1, 2016. The effective interest rate used to amortize the debt discount is approximately

10.2%

, which was based on the Company's estimated non-convertible borrowing rate as of the date the Notes were issued.

Issuance costs of

$0.9 million

related to the issuance of the Notes were allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as capitalized debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.

The net carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes consists of the following:

Total interest expense associated with the Notes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:

In connection with the offering of the Notes in October 2011, the Company entered into convertible note hedge (“call option”) and warrant transactions with multiple counterparties, including an affiliate of the initial purchaser. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that initially underlie the Notes, and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the Notes. The convertible note hedge will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the Notes or the first day the Notes are no longer outstanding. The Company paid

$117.5 million

for the convertible note hedge, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.

The warrant transactions have an initial strike price of approximately

$103.41

per share, and may be settled in cash or shares of the Company's Common Stock, at the Company's option. The warrant transactions have a dilutive effect to the extent that the

F-27


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

market price per share of the Company's Common Stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. Proceeds received from the warrant transactions totaled

$93.8 million

and were recorded as additional paid-in capital. The warrants expire at various dates during 2017.

The convertible note hedge and warrants are both considered indexed to the Company's Common Stock and classified as equity; therefore, the convertible note hedge and warrants are not accounted for as derivative instruments. The Company has reserved sufficient shares of its Common Stock to satisfy the potential settlement of the warrants.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

a. Leases

Descriptions of Lease Agreements

The Company leases laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York, under a December 2006 lease agreement, as amended (the “Tarrytown Lease”). The facilities leased by the Company under the Tarrytown Lease include (i) space in previously existing buildings, (ii) newly constructed space in

two

buildings (“Buildings A and B”) that was completed in the third quarter of 2009 and, (iii) under a December 2009 amendment to the Tarrytown Lease, additional newly constructed space in a third building (“Building C”) that was completed in the first quarter of 2011. The Tarrytown Lease will expire in June 2024 and contains

three

renewal options to extend the term of the lease by

five years

each, escalations at

2.5%

per annum, and early termination options for various portions of the space exclusive of the newly constructed space in Buildings A and B. The Tarrytown Lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses. Certain premises under the Tarrytown Lease are accounted for as operating leases. However, for Buildings A, B, and C that the Company is leasing, the Company is deemed, in substance, to be the owner of the landlord's buildings in accordance with the application of FASB authoritative guidance, and the landlord's costs of constructing these new facilities were required to be capitalized on the Company's books as a non-cash transaction, offset by a corresponding lease obligation on the Company's balance sheet.

In connection with the Tarrytown Lease, the Company issued a letter of credit in the amount of

$3.4 million

and collateralized the letter of credit with cash and marketable debt securities totaling

$3.7 million

and

$3.6 million

at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Such collateral has been classified as restricted cash and marketable securities.

In October 2008, the Company entered into a sublease with Sanofi U.S. for office space in Bridgewater, New Jersey. The lease commenced in January 2009 and expired in July 2011. In July 2011, the Company entered into an operating lease for office space in Liberty Corner, New Jersey, which expires in January 2017.

The Company also leases certain equipment under operating and capital leases which expire at various times through 2015.

Commitments under Operating Leases

The estimated future minimum noncancelable lease commitments under operating leases are as follows:

F-28


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Rent expense under operating leases was:

In addition to its rent expense under operating leases, and payments under facility lease obligations (see below), for various facilities, the Company paid rental charges for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses of

$10.9 million

,

$9.3 million

, and

$10.3 million

for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Commitments under Capital Leases

In 2011 and 2010, the Company entered into capital leases in connection with acquisitions of new equipment. The lease obligations are collateralized with marketable debt securities totaling

$3.2 million

and

$3.3 million

at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively; such collateral has been classified as restricted cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011.  The Company did not enter into capital leases in 2012.

The estimated future minimum noncancelable lease commitments under capital leases are as follows:

At the end of the lease term, the Company is required to purchase the leased equipment for a nominal amount defined in the lease agreement. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, capital lease obligations totaled

$1.3 million

and

$2.5 million

, respectively, and were included in other liabilities.

Facility Lease Obligations

As described above, in connection with the application of FASB authoritative guidance to the Company's lease of office and laboratory facilities in Buildings A, B, and C, the Company capitalized the landlord's costs of constructing the new facilities and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation. The Company also recognized, as additional facility lease obligation, reimbursements from the Company's landlord for tenant improvement costs that the Company incurred since, under FASB authoritative guidance, such payments that the Company receives from its landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation. Monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated between the land element of the lease (which is accounted for as an operating lease) and the facility lease obligation, which was based on the initial estimated relative fair values of the land and buildings.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had capitalized the landlord's costs of constructing Buildings A and B, which totaled

$58.4 million

, and of constructing Building C, which totaled

$27.8 million

. Reimbursements from the Company's landlord for Buildings A and B tenant improvement costs totaled

$56.9 million

and were received by the Company during 2010 and 2009. Reimbursements for Building C tenant improvement costs totaled

$14.2 million

and were received by the Company during 2010. With respect to Buildings A and B, monthly lease payments commenced in August 2009, the buildings were placed in service by the Company in September 2009, and the imputed interest rate applicable to the Company's facility lease obligation is approximately

11%

. With respect to Building C, monthly lease payments commenced in January 2011, the building was placed in service by the Company in February 2011, and the imputed interest rate applicable to the Company's facility lease obligation is approximately

9%

.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

In 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized

$16.0 million

and

$15.6 million

, respectively, of interest expense in connection with the Buildings A and B and the Building C facility lease obligations. In 2010, the Company recognized

$9.1 million

of interest expense in connection with the Buildings A and B facility lease obligation. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Buildings A and B facility lease obligation balance was

$112.0 million

and

$113.0 million

, respectively, and the Building C facility lease obligation balance was

$48.8 million

and

$47.5 million

, respectively.

The estimated future minimum noncancelable commitments under these facility lease obligations, as of December 31, 2012, are as follows:

b. Research Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company's research and development efforts, the Company enters into research collaboration and licensing agreements with related and unrelated companies, scientific collaborators, universities, and consultants. These agreements contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be provided, and ownership rights to certain proprietary technology developed under the agreements. Some of the agreements contain provisions which require the Company to pay royalties, as defined, at rates that range from

1%

to

16.5%

, in the event the Company sells or licenses any proprietary products developed under the respective agreements.

In December 2011, the Company and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement (the “Genentech Agreement”) relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States.  Pursuant to the Genentech Agreement, the Company received a non-exclusive license to certain patents relating to VEGF receptor proteins, known as the Davis-Smyth patents, and other technology patents. The Davis-Smyth patents are the subject of patent litigation between the Company and Genentech now pending in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. Patent litigation is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the Genentech Agreement (see Note 19).

Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, the Company agreed to make payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA commencing upon FDA approval of EYLEA in November 2011 through May 7, 2016. The Company made a one-time, non-refundable

$60.0 million

payment during 2012 upon cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA reaching

$400 million

. In addition, the Company agreed to pay royalties of

4.75%

on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA between

$400 million

and

$3 billion

and

5.5%

on any cumulative U.S sales of EYLEA over

$3 billion

. As the Company records net product sales of EYLEA, the Company is recognizing expense in connection with the Genentech Agreement using a blended mid-single digit royalty rate that reflects both the

$60.0 million

payment and the royalties payable on cumulative sales and that is based upon the Company's estimate of cumulative EYLEA sales through May 7, 2016.

The Company recognizes royalty expense based on net product sales of its commercial products

under various licensing agreements, including, for EYLEA sales in the United States, the Genentech Agreement described above. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, royalties on net product sales totaled

$59.5 million

,

$3.2 million

, and

$1.7 million

, respectively, and are included in cost of goods sold.

In July 2008, the Company and Cellectis S.A. (“Cellectis”) entered into an Amended and Restated Non-Exclusive License Agreement (the “Cellectis Agreement”). The Cellectis Agreement resolved a dispute between the parties related to the interpretation

F-30


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

of a license agreement entered into by the parties in December 2003 pursuant to which the Company licensed certain patents and patent applications from Cellectis. Pursuant to the Cellectis Agreement, in July 2008, the Company made a non-refundable

$12.5 million

payment to Cellectis (the “Cellectis Payment”) and agreed to pay Cellectis a low single-digit royalty based on revenue received by the Company from any future licenses or sales of the Company's

VelociGene

or

VelocImmune

products and services. No royalties are payable to Cellectis with respect to the Company's

VelocImmune

license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas or the Company's antibody collaboration with Sanofi. Moreover, no royalties are payable to Cellectis on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from the Company's

VelocImmune

technology.

The Company began amortizing the Cellectis Payment in the second quarter of 2008 in proportion to past and future anticipated revenues under the Company's license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas and the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement under the Company's antibody collaboration with Sanofi (as amended in November 2009). In 2012, 2011, and 2010,the Company recognized

$1.0 million

,

$1.0 million

, and

$0.9 million

, respectively, of expense in connection with the Cellectis Payment. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the unamortized balance of the Cellectis Payment, which was included in other assets, was

$4.7 million

and

$5.7 million

, respectively. The Company estimates that it will recognize expense of

$1.0 million

in 2013, and

$0.9 million

in each of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, in connection with the Cellectis Payment.

14. Stockholders' Equity

The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for the issuance of up to

40 million

shares of Class A Stock, par value

$0.001

per share, and

160 million

shares of Common Stock, par value

$0.001

per share. Shares of Class A Stock are convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into shares of Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class A Stock have rights and privileges identical to Common Stockholders except that each share of Class A is entitled to

ten votes per share

, while each share of Common Stock is entitled to

one vote per share

. Class A Stock may only be transferred to specified Permitted Transferees, as defined. Under the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's board of directors is authorized to issue up to

30 million

shares of preferred stock, in series, with rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined by the board of directors.

newly issued, unregistered shares of the Company's Common Stock for

$45.0 million

. See Note 4.

In December 2007, Sanofi purchased

12 million

newly issued, unregistered shares of the Company's Common Stock for an aggregate cash price of

$312.0 million

. As a condition to the closing of this transaction, Sanofi entered into an investor agreement with the Company, which was amended in November 2009. Under the amended investor agreement, Sanofi has three demand rights to require the Company to use all reasonable efforts to conduct a registered underwritten public offering with respect to shares of the Company's Common Stock beneficially owned by Sanofi immediately after the closing of the transaction.

Until the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the License and Collaboration Agreement

, as amended in 2009, under the Company's antibody collaboration with Sanofi (see Note 4) and the Company's collaboration agreement with Sanofi for the development and commercialization of ZALTRAP (see Note 4), Sanofi will be bound by certain “standstill” provisions. These provisions include an agreement not to acquire more than a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class A Stock and Common Stock. The percentage increased from

25%

to

30%

as of December 20, 2011. Under the amended investor agreement, Sanofi has also agreed not to dispose of any shares of the Company's Common Stock that were beneficially owned by Sanofi immediately after the closing of the transaction until December 20, 2017, subject to certain limited exceptions. Following December 20, 2017, Sanofi will be permitted to sell shares of the Company's Common Stock (i) in a registered underwritten public offering undertaken pursuant to the demand registration rights granted to Sanofi and described above, subject to the underwriter's broad distribution of securities sold, (ii) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act and transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act, subject to a volume limitation of one million shares of the Company's Common Stock every three months and a prohibition on selling to beneficial owners, or persons that would become beneficial owners as a result of such sale, of

5%

or more of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, and (iii) into an issuer tender offer, or a tender offer by a third party that is recommended or not opposed by the Company's board of directors. Sanofi has agreed to vote, and cause its affiliates to vote, all shares of the Company's voting securities they are entitled to vote, at Sanofi's election, either as recommended by the Company's board of directors or proportionally with the votes cast by the Company's other shareholders, except with respect to certain change of control transactions, liquidation or dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding

compensation plans or amendments if not materially consistent with the Company's historical equity compensation practices. The rights and restrictions under the investor agreement are subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain events.

In October 2010, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of

6,325,000

shares of Common Stock and received net proceeds of

$174.8 million

. Sanofi purchased

1,017,401

shares of Common Stock in this offering.

In October 2011, the Company completed a private placement of

$400.0 million

aggregate principal amount of Notes, which are convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock. In accordance with accounting guidance for debt with conversion and other options, the Company accounted for the liability and equity components of the Notes separately. The equity component of the Notes was

$120.6 million

, net of issuance costs. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The Company paid

$117.5 million

for the convertible note hedge, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. The warrant transactions have an initial strike price of approximately

$103.41

per share, and may be settled in cash or shares of the Company's Common Stock, at the Company's option. Proceeds received from the warrant transactions totaled

$93.8 million

and were recorded as additional paid-in capital. The warrants expire at various dates during 2017. See Note 12.

15. Long-Term Incentive Plans

During 2000, the Company established the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan which, as amended and restated (the “2000 Incentive Plan”), provides for the issuance of up to

41,307,016

shares of Common Stock in respect of awards. Employees of the Company, including officers, and nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members of the Company's board of directors, (collectively, “Participants”) may receive awards as determined by a committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The awards that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include: (a) Incentive Stock Options (“ISOs”) and Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock, (c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and (e) Other Awards.

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right to purchase shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the Committee; however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise price will not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest over a period of time determined by the Committee, generally on a pro rata basis over a

three

to

five

year period. The Committee also determines the expiration date of each Option; however, no ISO is exercisable more than

ten

years after the date of grant. The maximum term of options that have been awarded under the 2000 Incentive Plan is

ten

years.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares of restricted Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase such shares at a price determined by the Committee. Such shares are nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee (“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the Restricted Stock, which has not vested, will be transferred to the Company, except under defined circumstances with Committee approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company requires a return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the right to require a return of all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the right to receive, within


days of the date on which the share vests, an amount, in cash and/or shares of the Company's Common Stock as determined by the Committee, equal to the sum of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests and the aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to a share of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of the share of Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests. Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock which are granted at the discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are valued based on the Company's Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions of such Other Awards are determined solely on the authority of the Committee.

The 2000 Incentive Plan contains provisions that allow for the Committee to provide for the immediate vesting of awards upon a change in control of the Company, as defined in the plan.

As of December 31, 2012, there were

7,353,976

shares available for future grants under the 2000 Incentive Plan.

Stock Options

Transactions involving stock option awards during 2012 under the 2000 Incentive Plan are summarized in the table below.

The Company satisfies stock option exercises with newly issued shares of the Company's Common Stock. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2012, 2011, and 2010 was

$566.7 million

,

$49.2 million

, and

$21.4 million

, respectively. The intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option.

The Company grants stock options with exercise prices that are equal to or greater than the average market price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant (“Market Price”). The table below summarizes the weighted-average exercise prices and weighted-average grant-date fair values of options issued during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. The fair value of each option granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan during 2012, 2011, and 2010 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company recognized

$67.7 million

,

$39.2 million

, and

$29.4 million

, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance based stock option awards. As of December 31, 2012, there was

$286.3 million

of stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding non-performance based stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, which had not yet been recognized. The Company expects to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of

1.9

years.

In addition, there were a total of

1,392,000

performance-based options issued in 2010 and 2011 which were outstanding and unvested as of December 31, 2012, and subject to the optionee satisfying certain service conditions, would vest upon achieving

certain development milestones for the Company's product candidates. In light of the Company's receipt of marketing approval for (i) EYLEA for the treatment of wet AMD in November 2011 and macular edema following CRVO in September 2012, and (ii) ZALTRAP for treatment, in combination with FOLFIRI, of patients with mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen, and the status of the Company's development programs at December 31, 2012, the Company estimates that all of the outstanding performance-based options issued in 2010 and 2011 will vest.

For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company recognized

$15.3 million

,

$11.7 million

, and

$8.1 million

, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to these performance options. As of December 31, 2012 there was

$12.3 million

of stock-based compensation cost which had not yet been recognized related to the performance-based options that the Company currently estimates will vest. The Company expects to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of

1.8

years. The Company's estimates of the number of performance-based options that will vest will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods. Changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods related to performance-based options.

Fair value Assumptions:

The following table summarizes the weighted average values of the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option grants during 2012, 2011, and 2010.

Expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in the Company's stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options' expected lives. Expected lives are principally based on the Company's historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors' option grants. The expected dividend yield is

zero

as the Company has never paid dividends and does not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. The risk-free interest rates are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives.

b.

Restricted Stock

A summary of the Company's activity related to Restricted Stock awards for the year ended December 31, 2012 is summarized below:

The Company recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense from Restricted Stock awards of

$11.1 million

,

$5.7 million

, and

$2.4 million

in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, there were

642,499

unvested shares of Restricted Stock outstanding and

$56.1 million

of stock-based compensation cost related to these unvested shares which had not yet been recognized. The Company expects to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of

4.2

years.

16. Executive Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) under which

1,027,500

shares of Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock awards. The Plan provides for the compensation committee of the board of directors to award employees, directors, consultants, and other individuals (“Plan participants”) who render service to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock at a price set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides for the vesting of shares as determined by the compensation committee and, should the Company's relationship with a Plan participant terminate before all shares are vested, unvested shares will be repurchased by the Company at a price per share equal to the original amount paid by the Plan participant. During 1989 and 1990, a total of

983,254

shares were issued, all of which vested as of December 31, 1999. As of December 31, 2012, there were

res available for future grants under the Plan.

17. Employee Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide for employees who have met defined service requirements to participate in the Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the Savings Plan a percentage of their compensation to be set aside to pay their future retirement benefits, as defined. The Savings Plan, as amended and restated, provides for the Company to make discretionary contributions (“Contribution”), as defined. The Company recognized

18. Income Taxes

The Company is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. Income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2012 consists of the following:

During the year ended December 31, 2012, substantially all income tax expense relating to the Company's pre-tax income was offset by releasing a portion of the Company's valuation allowance. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a

$340.2 million

income tax benefit attributable to the release of substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets. The decision to release this valuation allowance was made after the Company determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized, and was based on the evaluation and weighting of positive and negative evidence. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company achieved a cumulative three-year income position; a significant positive factor that overcame substantive prior negative evidence. In addition, the Company considered forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company incurred a net loss for tax purposes and recognized a full valuation allowance against deferred taxes. In 2011, the Company recognized a

$1.1 million

income tax benefit, consisting of (i)

$0.7 million

related to tax legislation that allowed the Company to claim a refund for a portion of its unused pre-2006 research tax credits and

(ii)

$0.4 million

in connection with the net tax effect of the change in the Company's unrealized gain (loss) on “available for sale” marketable securities, which was included in other comprehensive income (loss).

For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred a net loss for tax purposes and recognized a full valuation allowance against deferred taxes. No provision or benefit for income taxes was recognized by the Company in 2010.

A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows:

In 2011 and 2010, the difference between the Company's effective income tax rate and the U.S federal statutory rate of

35%

was primarily attributable to an increase in the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data)

In 2012, the Company's net deferred tax assets (before valuation allowance) decreased, due primarily to utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carry-forward deferred tax asset to offset potential tax liabilities associated with the Company's 2012 pre-tax income. In addition, as described above, (i) substantially all income tax expense related to the Company's 2012 pre-tax income was offset by releasing a portion of the Company's valuation allowance during 2012 and (ii) in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company released substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets, resulting in the recognition of a

$340.2 million

income tax benefit. At December 31, 2012, the Company has retained a valuation allowance against certain state tax credits and other tax-related carry-forwards, as the realizability of these deferred tax assets within the carry-forward period is uncertain.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had available for tax purposes unused federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards of

$876.6 million

which will expire in various years from 2018 to 2032. The tax benefit of

$666.4 million

of these net operating loss carry-forwards related to exercises of Nonqualified Stock Options and disqualifying dispositions of Incentive Stock Options, which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. The Internal Revenue Code contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer's ability to utilize net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three-year period. The Company does not believe, however, that any such limitation would have a significant impact on the Company's ability to utilize its net operating losses or income tax credit carry-forwards prior to expiration.

In 2011, the Company's net deferred tax assets (before valuation allowance) increased, due primarily to increases in the Company's net operating loss carry-forward and tax credit carry-forwards, and the full recognition of the

$165.0 million

up-front payment received from Astellas in 2010 as taxable income in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the Company recognized a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets.

In 2011 and early 2012, U.S. federal tax authorities concluded examinations of the Company's 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal income tax returns. Tax years subsequent to 2007 remain open to examination by New York State tax authorities. The United States and many states generally have statutes of limitation ranging from 3 to 5 years; however, those statutes could be extended due to our net operating loss carry-forward position in a number of the Company's tax jurisdictions. In general, tax authorities have the ability to review income tax returns for loss periods in which the statute of limitation has previously expired to adjust the net operating loss carry-forward or tax credits generated in those years.

The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled. The amount, if recognized, that would impact the effective tax rate is

$8.4 million

,

$4.2 million

, and

$12.0 million

as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

In 2012, the gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company's calculation of certain tax credits. In 2011, the gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions was primarily due to the conclusion of examinations of the Company's 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal income tax returns by U.S. federal tax authorities. In 2010, the gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions was primarily due to the Company's calculations of certain pre-2010 tax credits. Due to the amounts of the Company's net operating loss carry-forward and tax credit carry-forwards, the Company has not accrued interest or penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not currently expect to reverse any portion of its unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 within the next year.

On January 2, 2013, The American Taxpayer Relief Act was enacted, retroactively extending various expiring tax provisions, including the credit for increased research activities, from January 1, 2012 through January 1, 2014.  As a result, during 2013, the Company will recognize the benefit of both the 2012 and 2013 federal research tax credit.

19. Legal Matters

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings in the course of the Company’s business. The Company does not expect any such current ordinary course legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or financial condition. Costs associated with the Company’s involvement in legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.

Genentech Patent Litigation

The Company is aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptors. The Company does not believe that ZALTRAP or EYLEA infringe any valid claim in these patents or patent applications. The Company is involved in

five

patent litigations with Genentech,

two

in the United States and

three

in Europe. In November 2010, the Company commenced a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court"), seeking a declaratory judgment that no activities relating to the Company's VEGF Trap infringe any valid claim of certain Genentech patents referred to as the Davis-Smyth patents (the "First Davis-Smyth Case"). Genentech answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims that the Company's prior or planned activities relating to VEGF Trap have infringed or will infringe claims of

four

of the Davis-Smyth patents and requested a judgment against the Company for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

On December 31, 2011, the Company entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement with Genentech (the "Genentech Agreement") that covers making, using, and selling EYLEA in the United States for the prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States, and ends the litigation relating to those matters. Under the Genentech Agreement, the Company received a non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth patents, and certain other technology patents owned or co-owned by Genentech. The Genentech Agreement does not cover any non-U.S. patent rights or non-U.S. patent disputes, and does not cover any use of aflibercept other than for prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the United States. The First Davis-Smyth Case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the Genentech Agreement. The Genentech Agreement provides for the Company to make payments to Genentech based on U.S. sales of EYLEA through May 7, 2016, the date the Davis-Smyth patents expire. As required by the Genentech Agreement, in 2012, the Company made a lump-sum payment of

$60.0 million

when cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA reached

$400 million

. The Company will also pay royalties of

4.75%

on cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA between

$400 million

and

$3 billion

and

5.5%

on any cumulative U.S. sales of EYLEA over

$3 billion

. As a result of the Genentech Agreement, on January 17, 2012, Genentech filed a second amended answer and counterclaim in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in which it amended its counterclaims alleging infringement of

four

of the Davis-Smyth patents. On December 23, 2011, Genentech initiated a related case in the Court against Regeneron and Sanofi alleging infringement of

four

of the Davis-Smyth Patents by activities relating to VEGF Trap (but excluding EYLEA) (the "Second Davis-Smyth Case"). As in the First Davis-Smyth Case, in the new complaint Genentech requests a judgment against the Company for damages, including for willful infringement, and other relief as the Court deems appropriate. On September 21, 2012, Genentech asserted

two

additional Davis-Smyth patents, and

one

additional application (which was allowed and issued as a patent on September 25, 2012) in both the First David-Smyth Case and the Second Davis-Smyth Case.

The Company believes Genentech's remaining claims in the First Davis Smyth Case and the Second Davis Smyth Case are without merit and intends to continue to defend against all of Genentech's remaining claims vigorously. As this litigation is at an early stage, at this time the Company is not able to predict the probability of the outcome or an estimate of loss, if any, related to these matters.

The Company has initiated patent-related actions against Genentech in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy relating in each case to a patent that expired on October 28, 2012. The Company may initiate other actions in other countries outside the United States, which could have similar or other adverse outcomes that would materially harm its business and which, irrespective of the outcomes, may also entail significant costs and expenses. In the United Kingdom, an adverse decision dated March 22, 2012 is under appeal. This decision found the designation of European patent EP 1 238 986 in the United Kingdom to be valid and potential

acts relating to VEGF Trap-Eye in the United Kingdom before expiration of the patent on October 28, 2012 to infringe this patent. A negative decision on appeal would result in an order requiring the Company to pay Genentech's recoverable legal costs.

20. Net Income (Loss) Per Share

The Company’s basic net income (loss) per share amounts have been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock outstanding. Net income (loss) per share is presented on a combined basis, inclusive of Common Stock and Class A Stock outstanding, as each class of stock has equivalent economic rights. Diluted net income per share includes the potential dilutive effect of other securities as if such securities were converted or exercised during the period, when the effect is dilutive. In 2011 and 2010, the Company reported net losses; therefore, no common stock equivalents were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for these periods, since such inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are as follows:

Shares which have been excluded from the

December 31, 2012

, 2011, and 2010 diluted per share amounts because their effect would have been antidilutive, include the following:
