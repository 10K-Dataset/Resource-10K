PART I

Item 1.

Business

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties
relating to the future financial performance of Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and actual events or results may differ
materially. These statements concern, among other things, the
possible therapeutic applications of our product candidates and
research programs, the timing and nature of the clinical and
research programs now underway or planned, and the future
sources and uses of capital and our financial needs. These
statements are made by us based on management’s current
beliefs and judgment. In evaluating such statements,
stockholders and potential investors should specifically
consider the various factors identified under the caption
“Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results”
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
indicated by such forward-looking statements. We do not
undertake any obligation to update

publicly any forward-looking statement,
whether as a result of new information, future events, or
otherwise, except as required by law.

General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a
biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and intends
to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of
serious medical conditions. Our product pipeline includes
product candidates for the treatment of obesity, rheumatoid
arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, cancer and related
disorders, allergies, asthma, and other diseases and disorders.
Developing and commercializing new medicines entails risk and
significant expense. Since inception we have not generated any
sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
product candidates.

Our core business strategy is to combine our
strong foundation in basic scientific research and
discovery-enabling technology with our manufacturing and
clinical development capabilities to build a successful,
integrated biopharmaceutical company. Our efforts have yielded a
diverse and growing pipeline of product candidates that have the
potential to address a variety of unmet medical needs. We
believe that our ability to develop product candidates is
enhanced by the application of our technology platforms, which
are designed to discover specific genes of therapeutic interest
for a particular disease or cell type and validate targets
through high-throughput production of mammalian models in which
a specific gene is removed (referred to as
“knock-out”) or is overproduced (referred to as
“transgenic”). We will continue to invest in the
development of enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to
identify, develop, and commercialize new product candidates.

Below is a summary of our leading clinical and
preclinical research programs. We currently retain sole
ownership and marketing rights for each of these programs, and
we are developing them independent of any corporate partners
except for the IL-1 Trap, as described in the Recent
Developments section.

AXOKINE®

: Acts
    on the brain region regulating food intake and energy
    expenditure and is being developed for the treatment of obesity.
    In July 2001, we initiated a Phase III clinical program of
    AXOKINE in overweight and obese subjects. We began enrolling
    subjects in the initial pivotal trial in September 2001 and in
    January 2002 completed enrollment of approximately
    2,000 subjects in 65 sites across the United States.
    This pivotal trial included a 12-month treatment period, which
    the Company announced was completed in January 2003, in which
    subjects received daily subcutaneous self-injections of placebo
    or AXOKINE. As described in the Recent Developments section, we
    reported data from the 12-month treatment period of the AXOKINE
    pivotal trial on March 31, 2003. The treatment period is
    being followed by a twelve-month open-label extension phase,
    during which all study subjects receive AXOKINE. As of
    December 31, 2002, the average treatment period for people
    in this pivotal trial was 14 months.

In June 2002, we announced the initiation of a
    clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE in
    overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes
    mellitus. In July 2002, we announced that we had completed
    enrollment for two additional trials, each of which includes
    approximately 300 subjects, that are designed to evaluate
    the safety of intermittent treatment with AXOKINE and to study
    maintenance of weight loss following short-term treatment
    regimens. The



In addition to the above programs which we are
conducting independent of any corporate partners, we have formed
collaborations to advance other research and development
efforts. We are conducting research with The Procter &
Gamble Company in muscle diseases and other fields. We are also
collaborating with Medarex, Inc. to discover, develop, and
commercialize certain human antibodies as therapeutics. In
partnership with Amgen Inc., we have development rights to
Neurotrophin-3, or NT-3, a clinical compound for the treatment
of constipating conditions, although there are no ongoing
development activities for NT-3 at this time. In all of these
research collaborations, we retain 50% of the commercialization
rights.



Recent Developments

Result of Phase III Obesity Study

On March 31, 2003, Regeneron announced
preliminary results of its initial double-blind,
placebo-controlled Phase III study evaluating AXOKINE in obese
and overweight subjects. The study included 1467 AXOKINE treated
subjects, who received daily subcutaneous injections of AXOKINE
at a dose of 1.0 microgram per kilogram, and 501 subjects who
received placebo. After twelve months, the preliminary findings
from the study were as follows:

•

AXOKINE treatment, when compared to placebo,
    achieved statistical significance with regard to both primary
    endpoints of the study:

•

An increased proportion of AXOKINE-treated
    patients lost at least 5% of their initial body weight compared
    to placebo-treated patients (25.1% vs. 17.6%, p<.001)

•

Participants receiving AXOKINE experienced a
    greater average weight loss than those receiving placebo (6.2
    lbs vs. 2.6 lbs, p<.001)

•

Greater than 5% weight loss in both the
    AXOKINE-treated and placebo populations was associated with
    expected trends in improvements in obesity-related parameters
    such as blood pressure, blood glucose and lipids

The reference to “p” value (relative to
placebo) means the probability of being wrong when asserting
that a true difference exists between the results for the
patient group in question and the placebo group. For example, a
p-value of less than 0.001 indicates that there is a less than
one in one thousand chance that the mean weight loss observed in
the group treated with drug and the mean weight loss observed in
the group treated with placebo are the same.

Although the results of this Phase III study were
statistically significant, the average weight loss for the
entire AXOKINE-treated population was small. AXOKINE associated
weight loss was limited by the development of antibodies
beginning after about 3 months of treatment, as noted
above. We intend to finish the analysis of our recently
concluded study in obese individuals with type II diabetes and
complete our on-going AXOKINE short-term treatment studies and
to evaluate the resulting data at that time.



Trial Design

The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
trial included 501 placebo-treated and 1467 AXOKINE-treated
participants from 65 study sites across the United States. The
average baseline for all participants was approximately 235 lbs.
For 12 months, subjects received daily subcutaneous
injections of either placebo or AXOKINE at a dose of 1.0
microgram per kilogram of body weight. To be included in the
study, participants could not have diabetes, and had to have a
body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 55 without obesity-related
risk factors, or 27 to 55 if they had obesity-related risk
factors such as high blood pressure or high blood lipids.

BMI is calculated as the weight of an individual
in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters.
Normal weight is designated by BMIs of 18.5-24.9, overweight by
BMIs of 25-29.9 and obesity by BMIs of 30 and above.

The 12-month treatment period is being followed
by a 12-month open-label safety extension phase during which all
participants receive AXOKINE and are further monitored for side
effects.

The preliminary data from the study are
summarized below. The Intent-to-Treat Analysis includes all
randomized subjects whether or not they completed the full
twelve months of treatment. The Completer Analysis includes only
those subjects who completed the full twelve months of
treatment. In the tables below, “n” refers to the
number of patients in each patient group.

IL-1 Trap Collaboration, License and Option
Agreement

On March 28, 2003, we entered into a
Collaboration, License and Option Agreement with Novartis Pharma
AG to develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap in rheumatoid
arthritis and other indications throughout the world with the
exception of Japan, where product rights remain with Regeneron.
We and Novartis will share equally in all profits from future
sales of the IL-1 Trap in North America and Europe. In other
markets, Novartis will be entitled to receive 75 percent of the
profits and we will be entitled to 25 percent of the profits. We
may co-promote the IL-1 Trap in all territories under the
agreement.

Novartis also purchased $48.0 million of newly
issued Regeneron common stock. The exact number of shares will
be determined based on the average closing price of the common
stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending May 9,
2003. In addition, Novartis made an up-front payment to us of
$27.0 million for our future development activities in the
United States in support of the IL-1 Trap. Regeneron may receive
up to $275.0 million in milestone payments upon the receipt of
regulatory approvals and achieving certain product revenues
targets. The agreement provides Novartis with the right of early
termination with specified advance notice.

Development expenses incurred during 2003 will be
shared equally by the companies. Our portion will be financed by
a loan from Novartis that will be forgiven, together with
accrued interest, should certain pre-clinical and clinical
milestones be reached and is otherwise payable on July 1,
2004. After 2003, Novartis will be responsible for any
additional pre-Phase III development expenses. Phase III
development expenses and pre-launch expenses in North America
and Europe will be shared equally by the companies. Novartis
will provide an interest bearing loan to finance our share of
these expenses as well. The loan and accrued interest are
repayable in full five years after the initial product launch of
the IL-1 Trap or five years after termination of Novartis’
rights to the IL-1 Trap under the agreement, whichever occurs
first.

Novartis will be responsible for providing
commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the IL-1 Trap.
Regeneron will continue to manufacture clinical supplies of the
IL-1 Trap at its plant in Rensselaer, New



York. Under the agreement, each company also has
the right to elect to collaborate on the development and
commercialization of other pre-clinical/early development IL-1
antagonists that we and Novartis currently are developing
independently.

Our Independent Programs

The following table lists the programs and
product candidates for which we retain sole ownership and
marketing rights except for the IL-1 Trap, as described in the
Recent Developments section.

AXOKINE.

We
are developing AXOKINE for the treatment of obesity. AXOKINE is
our patented molecule, which is a genetically re-engineered form
of ciliary neurotrophic factor, called CNTF.

Obesity is a major health problem in all
developed countries. The prevalence of obesity in the United
States has increased substantially during the past decade. A
1999 Congressional Report funded by the National Institutes of
Health confirmed that obesity significantly increases a number
of health risks, including Type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related
conditions, such as stroke and myocardial infarct are estimated
to contribute to about 300,000 deaths yearly, ranking second
only to smoking as a cause of preventable death. Several studies
published in 2002 demonstrate that even modest levels of weight
loss, when maintained over an extended period of time, can
significantly reduce the risk of developing Type 2
diabetes. Health care expenditures for obesity-related
conditions now total over $200 billion a year in the United
States. Current treatment of obesity consists of diet, exercise,
and other lifestyle changes, and a limited number of medicines.
There are several approved medicines currently indicated for the
treatment of obesity, including sibutramine (Meridia®, a
registered trademark of Abbott Laboratories) and orlistat
(Xenical®, a registered trademark of Hoffmann-LaRoche,
Inc.).

In July 2001, we initiated a Phase III
clinical program of AXOKINE in overweight and obese subjects. We
announced in January 2002 that this pivotal trial was fully
enrolled with approximately 2,000 subjects at 65 sites
across the United States. This trial is a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled study. It had a 12-month
treatment period, which was completed in January 2003, in which
subjects received daily subcutaneous self-injections of placebo
or AXOKINE at a dose of 1.0 microgram (mcg) per kilogram
(kg) of body weight. The treatment period is being followed by a
12-month open-label safety extension phase, during which all
subjects receive AXOKINE. Endpoints of the study are based on
changes in body weight versus baseline during the treatment
period. As of December 31, 2002, the average treatment
period for people in this trial was 14 months.

In addition to the pivotal trial described above,
the Company has several other smaller trials underway or in
planning phases. In June 2002, we announced the initiation of a
clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE in
overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes
mellitus. In July 2002, we announced that we had completed
enrollment for two additional trials, each of which includes
approximately 300 subjects, that are designed to evaluate
the safety of intermittent treatment with AXOKINE and to study
maintenance of weight loss following short-term treatment
regimens. The Company announced in January 2003 that AXOKINE has
received fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment
of severely obese people who



are unresponsive to, intolerant of, or unsuitable
candidates for certain FDA-approved medicines for the long-term
treatment of obesity. The Phase III program is expected to
enroll approximately 4,000 subjects in total.

In March 2000, we established a research and
development collaboration with Emisphere Technologies, Inc. to
utilize Emisphere’s oral drug delivery technology for
AXOKINE. In preliminary preclinical pharmacokinetic studies, the
Emisphere technology was able to achieve measurable blood levels
of AXOKINE.

Pegylated AXOKINE.

We are developing a pegylated
version of AXOKINE (pegAXOKINE) as a more potent, longer-acting
form of the protein. PegAXOKINE may allow for less frequent
and/or lower dosing in subjects. In its current form, the
molecule is not optimally absorbed into the blood stream and has
caused unacceptable injection site reactions. We are currently
working to develop an improved form of PegAXOKINE. Nektar
Therapeutics (formerly Shearwater Corporation) has contracted
with us to develop and supply the pegylated reagent for this
product candidate.

Cytokine Traps.

Our research on the CNTF class of
neurotrophic factors led to the discovery that CNTF, although it
is a neurotrophic factor, belongs to the “superfamily”
of signaling molecules referred to as cytokines. Cytokines are
soluble proteins secreted by the cells of the body. In many
cases, cytokines act as messengers to help regulate immune and
inflammatory responses. In excess, cytokines can be harmful and
have been linked to a variety of diseases. Blocking cytokines
and growth factors is a proven therapeutic approach with a
number of medicines or product candidates already approved or in
clinical development. The cytokine superfamily includes factors
such as erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor, and the interleukins (or ILs).

In 1994, our scientists made a breakthrough in
understanding how receptors work for an entire class of
interleukins in the human body. Based on this finding, we
developed a family of antagonists referred to as “Cytokine
Traps.” This family includes Cytokine Traps for IL-1, IL-4,
and IL-6 and a single Trap that blocks both IL-4 and IL-13.
Because these Traps mimic the body’s natural receptors,
they are effective at catching and holding the cytokines. With
the cytokines trapped, the immune system responds as if the
perceived threat is under control.

In preclinical studies, these Cytokine Traps are
more potent than other antagonists, potentially allowing lower
levels of these drug candidates to be used. Moreover, because
these Cytokine Traps are comprised entirely of natural
human-derived protein sequences, they may be less likely to
induce an immune reaction in humans. Because pathological levels
of IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 seem to contribute to a variety
of diseases, these Cytokine Traps have the potential to be
important therapeutic agents.

IL-1 Trap.

We
initiated a Phase II study of the IL-1 Trap in subjects
with rheumatoid arthritis in July 2002. This trial continues to
enroll subjects. A total of approximately 200 subjects will
receive weekly self-injections of one of three fixed doses of
IL-1 Trap or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by 10 weeks of
open-label follow-up. The results from this trial are expected
to be available mid-year 2003. The IL-1 Trap is also being
evaluated for potential uses in treating other inflammatory
diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease in
which the immune system attacks the tissue that lines and
cushions joints. Over time, the cartilage, bone, and ligaments
of the joint erode, leading to progressive joint deformity and
joint destruction, generally in the hand, wrist, knee, and foot.
Joints become painful and swollen and motion is limited. Over
time, the cartilage erodes, resulting in structural damage to
the joint. Over two million people, 1% of the U.S. population,
are estimated to have rheumatoid arthritis, and 10% of those
eventually become disabled. Women account for roughly two-thirds
of these patients.

IL-4/13 Trap.

Antagonists for IL-4 and IL-13 may be
therapeutically useful in a number of allergy and asthma-related
conditions, including as an adjunct to vaccines where blocking
IL-4 and IL-13 may help to elicit more of the desired type of
immune response to the vaccine. We have developed both an IL-4
Trap and an IL-4/13 Trap, which is a single molecule that can
block both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. In October 2002, we
initiated a Phase I clinical trial of a dual IL-4/13 Trap to
assess the safety and tolerability of



increasing dose levels of the molecule in
subjects with mild to moderate asthma. This trial continues to
enroll subjects.

One in 13 Americans suffers from allergies and
one in 18 suffers from asthma. The number of people afflicted
with these diseases has been growing at an alarming rate. It is
believed that IL-4 and IL-13 play a role in these diseases.
These two cytokines are essential to the normal functioning of
the immune system, creating a vital communication link between
white blood cells. In the case of asthma and allergies, however,
there are too many interleukins present, causing the immune
system to overact.

Other Cytokine Traps.

We have a late stage research program
underway for an IL-6 Trap. IL-6 has been implicated in the
pathology and progression of multiple myeloma, certain solid
tumors, AIDS, lymphomas (both AIDS-related and
non-AIDS-related), osteoporosis, and other conditions. We also
have patents covering additional Cytokine Traps for IL-2, IL-3,
IL-5, IL-15, gamma-interferon, transforming growth factor beta,
and others, which are being pursued at the research level. Our
research regarding protein-based cytokine antagonists currently
includes molecular and cellular research to improve or modify
Cytokine Trap technology, process development efforts to produce
experimental and clinical research supplies, and in vivo and in
vitro studies to further understand and demonstrate the efficacy
of the Cytokine Traps.

VEGF Trap and Angiopoietins.

A plentiful blood supply is
required to nourish every tissue and organ of the body. Diseases
such as diabetes and atherosclerosis wreak their havoc, in part,
by destroying blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries)
and compromising blood flow. Decreases in blood flow (known as
ischemia) can result in non-healing skin ulcers and gangrene,
painful limbs that cannot tolerate exercise, loss of vision, and
heart attacks. In other cases, disease processes can damage
blood vessels by breaking down vessel walls, resulting in
defective and leaky vessels. Leaking vessels can lead to
swelling and edema, as occurs in brain tumors following ischemic
stroke, in diabetic retinopathy, and in arthritis and other
inflammatory diseases. Finally, some disease processes, such as
tumor growth, depend on the induction of new blood vessels.

Depending on the clinical situation, positively
or negatively regulating blood vessel growth could have
important therapeutic benefits, as could the repair of damaged
and leaky vessels. Thus, building new vessels, by a process
known as angiogenesis, can improve circulation to ischemic limbs
and heart, and aid in healing of skin ulcers or other chronic
wounds, and in establishing tissue grafts. Reciprocally,
blocking tumor-induced angiogenesis can blunt tumor growth. In
addition, repairing leaky vessels can reverse swelling and edema.

Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) was the first growth factor shown to be specific for
blood vessels, by virtue of having its receptor specifically
expressed on blood vessel cells. In 1994, our scientists
discovered a second family of angiogenic growth factors, termed
the Angiopoietins, and we have received patents for the members
of this family. The Angiopoietins include naturally occurring
positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis, as described
in numerous scientific manuscripts published by our scientists
and their collaborators.

Our studies have revealed that VEGF and the
Angiopoietins normally function in a coordinated and
collaborative manner during blood vessel growth. Thus, the
growth of new blood vessels to nourish ischemic tissue appears
to require use of both these agents. In addition, Angiopoietin-1
seems to play a critical role in stabilizing the vessel wall,
and the use of this growth factor can prevent or repair leaky
vessels in animal models. In terms of blocking vessel growth,
manipulation of both VEGF and Angiopoietin seems to be of value.

In November 2001, we initiated a Phase I clinical
trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of the VEGF
Trap in subjects with solid tumor malignancies and/or subjects
with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The Phase I trial is an
open-label study in subjects with advanced tumors and is
evaluating the VEGF Trap in increasing dose levels. The ongoing
study is being conducted at 3 clinical sites in the United
States and is expected to end in 2003.

We and others have identified a family of growth
factors termed the Ephrins and their receptors termed the Ephs.
Members of this family have specific roles in angiogenesis and
hemopoiesis, which are being pursued in preclinical studies.



Cartilage Growth Factor System and
Osteoarthritis.

Osteoarthritis
results from the wearing down of the articular cartilage
surfaces that cover joints. Thus, growth factors that
specifically act on cartilage cells could have utility in
osteoarthritis. Our scientists have discovered a growth factor
receptor system selectively expressed by cartilage cells, termed
Regeneron Orphan Receptor 2 (ROR2). We have also demonstrated
that this growth factor receptor system is required for normal
cartilage development in mice. In addition, together with
collaborators, we have proven that mutations in this growth
factor receptor system cause inherited defects in cartilage
development in humans. Thus, this growth factor receptor system
is a promising new target for cartilage diseases such as
osteoarthritis, but we have not yet identified any therapeutic
molecules from our research to advance to clinical development.

Our Collaborative Programs

Muscle Atrophy and Related Disorders.

Muscle atrophy occurs in many
neuromuscular diseases and also when muscle is unused, as often
occurs during prolonged hospital stays and during convalescence.
Currently, physicians have few options to treat subjects with
muscle atrophy or other muscle conditions which afflict millions
of people globally. Thus, a factor that has beneficial effects
on skeletal muscle could have significant clinical benefit. Our
muscle program is currently focused on conducting in vivo and in
vitro experiments with the objective of demonstrating and
further understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in
muscle atrophy and hypertrophy. This work is being conducted in
collaboration with scientists at Procter & Gamble.

Other Early Stage Programs: Fibrosis and
G-Protein Coupled Receptors.

Fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis, result from the excess
production of fibrous extracellular matrix by certain cell
types. We and our collaborators identified orphan receptors,
termed Discoidin Domain Receptors 1 and 2 (DDR1 and DDR2), that
are expressed by the activated cell types in fibrotic disease.

Our work in this area is currently focused on
determining whether selective inhibition or activation of DDR1
and DDR2 would be beneficial in the setting of fibrotic disease.
Further, we are studying key signaling pathways which allow
particular fibrosis-inducing cells to multiply. Inhibition of
such pathways may be useful in preventing the development of
fibrosis. These research activities are being conducted in
collaboration with scientists at Procter & Gamble.

We also have a research program focused on the
discovery and characterization of G-Protein Coupled Receptors,
which have historically been among the most useful targets for
pharmaceuticals. We use a genomics approach to discover new
receptors and then we characterize these receptors in our
disease models by examining their expression. Early stage
research work on selected G-Protein Coupled Receptors is being
conducted in collaboration with scientists at Procter &
Gamble.

Our Technology Platforms

Our ability to discover and develop product
candidates for a wide variety of serious medical conditions
results from the leveraging of our powerful technology
platforms, many of which were developed or enhanced by us.
Although the primary use of these technology platforms is for
our own research and development programs, we are also exploring
the possibilities of exploiting these technologies commercially
through, for example, direct licensing or sale of technology, or
the establishment of research collaborations to discover and
develop drug targets. In December 2002, we entered into a supply
agreement with Serono S.A. to provide them with mammalian models
utilizing our Velocigene™ technology.

Targeted
Genomics

TM

: In contrast
to basic genomics approaches, which attempt to identify every
gene in a cell or genome, we use Targeted Genomics approaches to
identify specific genes likely to be of therapeutic interest.
These approaches do not depend on random gene sequencing, but
rather on function-based approaches to specifically target the
discovery of genes for growth factors, peptides, and their
receptors that are most likely to have use for developing drug
candidates. This technology has already led to our discovery of
the Angiopoietin and Ephrin growth factor families for
angiogenesis and vascular disorders, the MuSK growth factor
receptor system for muscle disorders, and the Regeneron Orphan
Receptor (ROR) growth factor receptor system that regulates
cartilage formation.



Velocigene

TM

:
A major challenge facing the biopharmaceutical industry in the
post-genomic era is the efficient assignment of function to
random gene sequences to enable the identification of validated
drug targets. One way to help determine the function of a gene
is to generate mammalian models in which the gene is removed
(referred to as “knock-out mammalian models”), or is
over-produced (referred to as “transgenic mammalian
models”), or in which a color-producing gene is substituted
for the gene of interest (referred to as “reporter knockin
mammalian models”) to identify which cells in the model are
expressing the gene. Until recently, technical hurdles involved
in the generation of mammalian models restricted the ability to
produce multiple models quickly and efficiently. We have
developed proprietary technology that we believe will allow for
the rapid and efficient production of models on a high
throughput scale, enabling rapid assignment of function to gene
sequences.

Designer Protein
Therapeutics

TM

. In
cases in which the natural gene product is itself not a product
candidate, we utilize our Designer Protein Therapeutics platform
to genetically engineer product candidates with the desired
properties. We use these technologies to develop derivatives of
growth factors and their receptors, which can allow for modified
agonistic or antagonistic properties that may prove to be
therapeutically useful. Examples include the generation of
AXOKINE and the development of Cytokine Traps and the VEGF Trap.
This technology platform has already produced more than 10
patented proteins, including the IL-1 Trap currently in
Phase II clinical testing, and several others in
preclinical development.

Collaborative Relationships

In addition to our independent programs, we
currently conduct programs in collaboration with academic and
corporate partners. We have entered into research collaboration
and licensing agreements with various corporate partners,
including Procter & Gamble, Medarex, and Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals. In the future, we may enter into additional
strategic collaborations focusing on one or more of our product
candidates, research programs, or technology platforms.

Procter & Gamble.

In May 1997, we entered into a
long-term collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble to
discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products. In
connection with the collaboration, Procter & Gamble made
Regeneron equity purchases of $42.9 million in June 1997
and $17.1 million in August 2000. These equity purchases
were in addition to a purchase by Procter & Gamble of
$10.0 million of our common stock that was completed in
March 1997. Procter & Gamble also agreed to provide funding
in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration,
of which we received $69.5 million through December 31,
2002. From 1997 to 1999, Procter & Gamble also provided
research support for our AXOKINE program. As a result, Procter
& Gamble will be entitled to receive a small royalty on any
sales of AXOKINE.

In August 2000, Procter & Gamble made two
non-recurring research progress payments to us totaling
$3.5 million. Effective December 31, 2000, we and
Procter & Gamble entered into a new long-term collaboration
agreement, replacing the companies’ 1997 agreement. The new
agreement extends Procter & Gamble’s obligation to fund
our research under the new collaboration agreement through
December 2005, with no further research obligations by either
party thereafter, and focuses the companies’ collaborative
research on therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to
Procter & Gamble, including muscle atrophy and muscle
diseases, fibrotic diseases, and selected G-Protein Coupled
Receptors. For each of these program areas, the parties
contribute research activities and necessary intellectual
property rights pursuant to mutually agreed upon plans and
budgets established by operating committees. During the first
five years of the agreement, neither party will independently
perform research on targets included in the collaboration.

We and Procter & Gamble have divided rights
to the programs from the 1997 collaboration agreement that are
no longer part of the companies’ collaboration. Procter
& Gamble has obtained rights to certain early stage
programs. We have rights to all other research programs
including exclusive rights to the VEGF Trap, the Angiopoietins,
and Regeneron’s Orphan Receptors (RORs). Any product
candidates that result from the new collaboration will continue
to be jointly developed and marketed worldwide, with the
companies equally sharing development costs and profits. Under
the new agreement, beginning in the first quarter of 2001,
research support from Procter & Gamble is $2.5 million
per quarter (before adjustments for inflation) through December
2005.



The new collaboration agreement will expire on
the later of December 31, 2005 or the termination of
research, development, or commercial activities relating to
compounds that meet predefined success criteria before that
date. In addition, if either party successfully develops a
compound covered under the agreement to a predefined development
stage during the two-year period following December 31,
2005, the parties shall meet to determine whether to reconvene
joint development of the compound under the agreement. The
agreement is also subject to termination if either party enters
bankruptcy, breaches its material obligations, or undergoes a
change of control. In addition to termination rights, our new
collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble has an
“opt-out” provision, whereby a party may decline to
participate further in a research or product development
program. In such cases, the opting-out party will generally not
have any further funding obligation and will not have any rights
to the product or program in question (but may be entitled to a
royalty on any product sales). If Procter & Gamble opts out
of a product development program, and we do not find a new
partner, we would bear the full cost of the program.

Medarex.

In March
2000, we entered into a collaboration under a binding memorandum
of understanding with Medarex to discover, develop, and
commercialize human antibodies as therapeutics. We agreed to
contribute our expertise in discovering and characterizing
proteins as drug targets, and Medarex agreed to contribute its
HuMAb-Mouse

TM

technology to create fully human
antibody products for those targets. We and Medarex agreed to
prioritize targets based upon a variety of criteria, including
target validation, reagent availability, market opportunity,
competitive factors, intellectual property position, and the
expected feasibility of obtaining antibodies that have the
desired properties. The HuMAb-Mouse is a transgenic mouse whose
genes for creating mouse antibodies have been inactivated and
replaced by human antibody genes. This makes it possible to
rapidly create and develop fully human antibodies as drug
candidates.

Under the agreement, Medarex and we share all
development, manufacturing, and clinical costs of jointly
developed products and all net profits and losses. Each of us
has the right to opt out of the joint development of the antigen
target and receive instead certain milestones and royalty
payments on net sales. The agreement terminates when neither
party is exploiting any antibody products developed under the
collaboration. The agreement is also subject to termination if
either party enters bankruptcy or breaches its material
obligations thereunder.

Emisphere.

In March
2000, we signed an agreement with Emisphere Technologies, Inc.
to establish a research and development collaboration to utilize
Emisphere’s oral drug delivery technology for AXOKINE. In
preliminary preclinical pharmacokinetic studies, the Emisphere
technology was able to achieve measurable blood levels of
AXOKINE. Under the terms of the agreement, we support research
at Emisphere and make license and milestone payments based on
the satisfaction of pre-determined criteria during the
development of orally delivered AXOKINE. The parties established
a steering committee to determine these milestones, which
trigger either payment obligations or termination rights for
either party. The first of these milestones, as amended, is
based on the status of the program as of May 31, 2003. The
steering committee meets on at least a quarterly basis to review
the results of the program. The agreement is subject to
termination if either party breaches its material obligations
thereunder. During the term of the agreement, we will receive
exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to oral products
that result from the collaboration and pay Emisphere a royalty
on sales of any such products.

Nektar.

In December
2000, we entered into a license and supply agreement with
Shearwater Corporation, now Nektar Therapeutics, under which
Nektar agreed to develop and supply a pegylated reagent that
could be used to formulate a modified form of AXOKINE. In
preclinical studies, a pegylated AXOKINE was substantially
longer lasting than unmodified AXOKINE. This may allow less
frequent and/or lower dosing in subjects. Under the terms of the
agreement, Nektar agreed to develop and supply the reagent and
we manufacture and have exclusive rights to pegylated AXOKINE.
Nektar is entitled to receive milestone payments based on the
development of the modified AXOKINE and will be the exclusive
supplier of the reagent. We will pay Nektar a royalty not to
exceed 2.5% on sales of any pegylated AXOKINE. The agreement
remains in force until the later of ten years from the grant of
the first marketing approval for a pegylated AXOKINE or the last
to expire patent covering Nektar’s pegylated reagent. In
addition, each party has the right to terminate the agreement
upon bankruptcy of the other party or the other party’s
breach of a



material obligation under the agreement. We have
additional termination rights if market or other conditions,
including regulatory restrictions, seriously inhibit the ability
to develop or market pegylated AXOKINE.

Amgen.

Amgen-Regeneron Partners has the
development rights to NT-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor, or BDNF, in the United States. We are required to fund
50% of the development costs of Amgen-Regeneron Partners to
maintain 50% of the commercialization rights. Assuming equal
capital contributions to Amgen-Regeneron Partners, we and Amgen
share any profits or losses of the partnership equally.
Amgen-Regeneron Partners has conducted clinical trials of NT-3
and BDNF in the past. Following a review of available clinical
trial data, we and Amgen discontinued the development of BDNF
for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, in
January 2001. Currently, there are no ongoing development
activities for NT-3.

Our agreement with Amgen will continue for the
longer of the life of the patents covering NT-3 or fifteen years
from the date on which NT-3 is approved for commercial marketing
in any country. The agreement is also subject to termination if
either party enters bankruptcy or breaches its material
obligations thereunder. During the term of the agreement, there
are restrictions on the ability of either party to independently
conduct research or development of NT-3 without the other party.
Our aggregate capital contribution to Amgen-Regeneron Partners
from the partnership’s inception in June 1993 through
December 31, 2001 was $57.9 million. In 2002, we made
no capital contributions to the partnership and received a
capital withdrawal of $0.5 million. We do not expect to
make capital contributions to the partnership in 2003.
Additional contributions may be required, depending upon, among
other things, whether and how Amgen-Regeneron Partners proceeds
with the development of NT-3.

The development and commercialization of NT-3
outside of the United States, Japan, China, and certain other
Pacific Rim countries, if any, will be conducted solely by Amgen
through a license from us and from Takeda Chemical Industries,
Ltd. In return, we will receive royalty payments based on
Amgen’s net sales of NT-3 in the licensed territory. In the
licensed territory, Amgen is solely responsible for funding
clinical development and related costs of NT-3, as well as costs
of their commercial exploitation, and has sole discretion with
respect to all such development, manufacturing, and marketing of
the product and sole responsibility for filing applications for
regulatory approvals.

Sumitomo.

In March
1989, Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd. entered into a Technology
Development Agreement with us and paid us $5.6 million. In
addition, Sumitomo Chemical purchased $4.4 million of our
equity. In connection with this agreement, we granted Sumitomo
Chemical a limited right of first negotiation, over a
fifteen-year period, to license up to three of our product
candidates to commercialize in Japan on financial and commercial
terms as we may offer. If Sumitomo Chemical decides it does not
wish to enter into a license agreement with us on the terms we
propose, we are free to license the product candidate to any
other third party in Japan on terms and conditions no more
favorable to a third party licensee than those offered to
Sumitomo Chemical. We are obligated periodically to inform and,
if requested, to meet with Sumitomo Chemical management about
our progress in research and development. This agreement expires
on the earlier of March 20, 2004 or the date that Sumitomo
Chemical licenses three-product candidates from us, provided
that the parties may extend the agreement for an additional
five-year term.

BDNF is licensed to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals
Company, Ltd. (a subsidiary of Sumitomo Chemical) for
development in Japan. In light of the discontinuation of BDNF
development for ALS, we do not expect to receive further
payments from Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals for research progress
payments, contract research and development, or contract
manufacturing related to BDNF. We recognized revenue from
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals of $0.2 million in 2001 and
$7.6 million in 2000.

Serono.

In December
2002, we entered into an agreement with Serono S.A. to use
Regeneron’s proprietary Velocigene™ technology
platform to provide Serono with knock-out and transgenic
mammalian models of gene function. Under the terms of the
agreement, Serono will pay Regeneron up to $3.0 million
annually for up to five years. In return, Regeneron will use
Velocigene to provide knock-out and transgenic models for target
genes to be specified by Serono.



Manufacturing

We maintain an 8,000 square foot manufacturing
facility in Tarrytown, New York. This facility, designed to
comply with FDA current good manufacturing practices (GMP),
produces preclinical and clinical supplies of our product
candidates.

In 1993, we purchased our 104,000 square foot
Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facility, which is being used
to manufacture therapeutic candidates for our own preclinical
and clinical studies. We also use the facility to manufacture a
product for Merck under a contract that expires in 2005. We are
currently building a 19,500 square foot expansion onto our
Rensselaer facility. In July, 2002, we leased 75,000 square feet
in a building near our Rensselaer facility. That space is being
renovated for the manufacture of Traps and for warehouse space.

At December 31, 2002, we employed 266 people
in our manufacturing operations at these facilities.

In 1995, we entered into a long-term
manufacturing agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. (called, as
amended, the Merck Agreement) to produce an intermediate for a
Merck pediatric vaccine at our Rensselaer facility. We agreed to
modify portions of our facility for manufacture of the Merck
intermediate and to assist Merck in securing regulatory approval
for manufacturing in the Rensselaer facility. In December 1999,
we announced that the FDA had approved us as a contract
manufacturer for the Merck intermediate. Under the Merck
Agreement, we are manufacturing intermediate for Merck for six
years, with certain minimum order quantities each year. The
Merck Agreement is expected to extend through 2005, but may be
terminated at any time by Merck upon one year’s notice.
Merck agreed to reimburse us for the capital costs to modify the
facility and for the cost of our activities performed on behalf
of Merck prior to the start of production. Merck also agreed to
pay an annual facility fee of $1.0 million, subject to
annual adjustment for inflation, reimburse us for certain
manufacturing costs, pay us a variable fee based on the quantity
of intermediate supplied to Merck, and make certain additional
payments. We recognized contract manufacturing revenue related
to the Merck Agreement of $11.1 million in 2002,
$9.8 million in 2001, and $12.5 million in 2000.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing
approval of a medicine is the requirement that the prospective
manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
conform to the GMP regulations of the health authority. In
complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in
the area of production and quality control to ensure full
technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign
and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the
authority of the FDA and by other national, federal, state, and
local agencies. If our manufacturing facilities fail to comply
with FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be required
to suspend manufacturing. This will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and
cash flow.

Competition

There is substantial competition in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and chemical companies. Our competitors may
include Hoffmann-LaRoche, Abbott Laboratories,
Sanofi-Synthelabo, Merck, Pfizer, Amgen, and others. Many of our
competitors have substantially greater research, preclinical,
and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities,
and financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. Our
smaller competitors may also be significant if they acquire or
discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements,
or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even if we achieve
product commercialization, one or more of our competitors may
achieve product commercialization earlier than we do or obtain
patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our
activities. Our ability to compete will depend on how fast we
can develop safe and effective product candidates, complete
clinical testing and approval processes and supply commercial
quantities of the product to the market. Competition among
product candidates approved for sale will also be based on
efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent
position, and other factors.

AXOKINE:

There is
substantial competition in the discovery and development of
treatments for obesity, as well as established, cost-effective,
and emerging prescription and over-the-counter treatments for



this condition. For example, Hoffmann-LaRoche and
Abbott Laboratories already market well-established medicines
for the treatment of obesity and Amgen, Sanofi-Synthelabo and a
number of other pharmaceutical companies are developing new
potential therapeutics. Sanofi-Synthelabo has a cannaboid
receptor antagonist in Phase III clinical development. Some
of these medicines or therapeutic candidates may offer
competitive advantages over AXOKINE. For example, AXOKINE
currently is available only in injectible form, while the
currently available marketed medicines for the treatment of
obesity and Sanofi-Synthelabo’s product candidate are
delivered in pill (or oral dosage) forms, which generally are
favored by people over injectible medicines. Therefore, even if
AXOKINE is approved for sale, the fact that it must be delivered
by injection may severely limit its market acceptance among
patients and physicians.

Cytokine Traps:

Similarly, marketed products for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are available as
either oral or inhaled medicines, whereas our Cytokine Traps
currently are only planned for clinical trials as injectibles.
The markets for both rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are very
competitive. Several new, highly successful medicines recently
became available for these disease states. Examples include the
TNF-antagonists Enbrel® (a registered trademark of Amgen),
Remicade® (a registered trademark of Centocor), and
Humira® (a registered trademark of Abbott) for rheumatoid
arthritis and the leukotriene-modifier Singulair® (a
registered trademark of Merck), as well as various inexpensive
corticosteroid medicines, for asthma.

VEGF Trap:

Many
companies are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block
the actions of VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A
variety of approaches have been employed, including antibodies
to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF receptor, small molecule
antagonists to the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, as well as
multiple other anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of these
alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to our
VEGF Trap in efficacy, side-effect profile, or form of delivery.
Additionally, many of these developmental molecules may be at a
more advanced stage of development than our product candidate.
In particular, Genentech’s Avastin™, a monoclonal
antibody to VEGF, is in Phase III clinical trials.

Other Areas:

Many
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to
discover and develop small-molecule based therapeutics, similar
in at least certain respects to our program with Procter &
Gamble. In these and related areas, intellectual property rights
have been sought and certain rights have been granted to
competitors and potential competitors of ours, and we may be at
a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result
of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained
personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic
competitors are involved in the discovery and development of
novel therapeutics using tyrosine kinase receptors, orphan
receptors, and compounds that are the focus of other research or
development programs we are now conducting. These competitors
include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many others. Many firms
and entities are engaged in research and development in the
areas of cytokines, interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle
conditions. Some of these competitors are currently conducting
advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these
areas. These and other competitors may have established
substantial intellectual property and other competitive
advantages.

If a competitor announces a successful clinical
study involving a product that may be competitive with one of
our product candidates or an approval by a regulatory agency of
the marketing of a competitive product, such announcement may
have a material adverse effect on our operations, or future
prospects, or the price of our common stock.

We also compete with academic institutions,
governmental agencies, and other public or private research
organizations, which conduct research, seek patent protection,
and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and
marketing of products that would provide royalties for use of
their technology. These institutions are becoming more active in
seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect
royalties for use of the technology that they have developed.
Products developed in this manner may compete directly with
products we develop. We also compete with others in acquiring
technology from such institutions, agencies, and organizations.



Patents, Trademarks and Trade
Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to
obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate
without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.
Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology,
inventions, and improvements that are considered important to
the development of our business. We have been granted
approximately 80 U.S. patents and we have approximately 100
pending U.S. applications. We are the exclusive or nonexclusive
licensee of a number of additional U.S. patents and patent
applications. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and
continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our
competitive position. We or our licensors or collaborators have
filed patent applications on products and processes relating to
AXOKINE, Cytokine Traps, VEGF Trap, and Angiopoietins, as well
as other technologies and inventions in the United States and in
certain foreign countries. We intend to file additional patent
applications, when appropriate, relating to improvements in
these technologies and other specific products and processes. We
plan to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents
and other proprietary technology.

In July 2002, we announced that Amgen and Immunex
Corporation (now part of Amgen) granted us a non-exclusive
license to certain patents and patent applications which may be
used in the development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap.
The license followed two other licensing arrangements under
which we obtained a non-exclusive license to patents owned by
ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Tularik Inc. for use in connection with
the IL-1 Trap program. These license agreements would require us
to pay royalties based on the net sales of the IL-1 Trap if and
when it is approved for sale. In total, the royalty rate under
these three agreements would be in the mid-single digits.

Patent law relating to the patentability and
scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our
patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty. Others
may independently develop similar products or processes to those
developed by us, duplicate any of our products or processes or,
if patents are issued to us, design around any products and
processes covered by our patents. We expect to continue to file
product and process patent applications with respect to our
inventions. However, we cannot assure you that we will file any
such applications or, if filed, that the patents will be issued.
Patents issued to or licensed by us may be infringed by the
products or processes of others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual
property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the
outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued
to or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a
court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of
third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the
development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into
account patent right of third parties.

Government Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the
United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in
the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of our
product candidates. All of our product candidates will require
regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In
particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous
preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-market approval
requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of
the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign
pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during
recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a
number of forums. The ultimate outcome and impact of such
reforms and potential reforms cannot be reasonably predicted.

The activities required before a product
candidate may be marketed in the United States begin with
preclinical tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory
evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety
and efficacy of the product candidate and its formulations. The
results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of
an Investigational New Drug Application, which must be reviewed
by the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin.
Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In
Phase I, trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to
determine the early safety profile of the product candidate. In
Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with subjects
afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough
data to evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and
efficacy of different



potential doses of the product candidate. In
Phase III, large-scale clinical trials are conducted with
patients afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in
order to provide enough data to understand the efficacy and
safety profile of the product candidate, as required by the FDA.
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a
biologic product candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the
form of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for evaluation
to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for
commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant
marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the
application.

We cannot assure you that any approval required
by the FDA for any of our product candidates will be obtained on
a timely basis, if at all. The designation of a clinical trial
as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative
that such a trial will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters
of a particular phase, and a clinical trial may contain elements
of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the
trial as being of a particular phase. We cannot assure you that
the results of preclinical studies or early stage clinical
trials will predict long-term safety or efficacy of our
compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in humans.

Various federal and state statutes and
regulations also govern or influence the research, manufacture,
safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport,
or other aspects of such product candidates. The lengthy process
of seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable
statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial
resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees
to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could
adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of our products
and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and
future business will be subject to regulation under the United
States Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, and the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, national restrictions, and other present and
potential future local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, we had 669
full-time employees, 126 of whom held a Ph.D. or M.D. degree or
both. We believe that we have been successful in attracting
skilled and experienced personnel in a highly competitive
environment; however, competition for these personnel is
intense. None of our personnel are covered by collective
bargaining agreements and our management considers its relations
with our employees to be good.

Available Information

We file annual, quarterly, and current reports,
proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any
materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public
Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC
20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the
Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains
reports, proxy and information statements, and other information
regarding issuers, including Regeneron, that file electronically
with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file
with the SEC at

http://www/sec/gov.

We also intend to make available free of charge
on or through our Internet website

(http://www.regn.com)

Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if
applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.



Item 2.

Properties

We conduct our research, development,
manufacturing, and administrative activities at our own
facilities. We currently lease approximately 220,000 square
feet, and sublease approximately 16,000 square feet, of
laboratory, office, and manufacturing space in Tarrytown, New
York. We own a facility in Rensselaer, New York, consisting of

increase our manufacturing and office space by an additional
19,500 square feet. In the future, we may locate, lease,
operate, or purchase additional facilities in which to conduct
expanded research and development activities and manufacturing
and commercial operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In September 2000, Immunex Corporation filed a
request with the European Patent Office seeking the declaration
of an Opposition regarding the scope of our European patent
relating to Cytokine Traps. This legal challenge to the validity
and scope of our patent was heard by the European Patent Office
in March 2003. The European Patent Office upheld the patent with
clarifying amendments to the main claim which more specifically
defined the claimed subject matter. In addition to this patent
challenge, we have from time to time been subject to legal
claims arising in connection with our business. While the
ultimate results of the legal claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, at December 31, 2002, there were no asserted
claims against us which, in the opinion of management, if
adversely decided, would have a material adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

General

We are a biopharmaceutical company that
discovers, develops, and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical
products for the treatment of serious medical conditions. Our
product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment
of obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory
conditions, cancer and related disorders, allergies, asthma, and
other diseases and disorders. Developing and commercializing new
medicines entails risk and significant expense. Since inception
we have not generated any sales or profits from the
commercialization of any of our product candidates.

Below is a summary of our leading clinical and
preclinical research programs. We retain sole ownership and
marketing rights for each of these programs, and currently are
developing them independent of any corporate partners except for
the IL-1 Trap, as described in the Recent Developments section
included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

•

AXOKINE®:

Acts
    on the brain region regulating food intake and energy
    expenditure and is being developed for the treatment of obesity.
    In July 2001, we initiated a Phase III clinical program of
    AXOKINE in overweight and obese subjects. We began enrolling
    subjects in the initial pivotal trial in September 2001 and in
    January 2002 completed enrollment of approximately
    2,000 subjects in 65 sites across the United States.
    This pivotal trial included a 12-month treatment period, which
    the Company announced was completed in January 2003, in which
    subjects received daily subcutaneous self-injections of placebo
    or AXOKINE. As described in the Recent Developments section,
    included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, we
    reported data from the 12-month treatment period of the AXOKINE
    pivotal trial on March 31, 2003. The treatment period is
    being followed by a twelve-month open-label extension phase,
    during which all study subjects receive AXOKINE. As of
    December 31, 2002, the average treatment period for people
    in this pivotal trial was 14 months.

In June 2002, we announced the initiation of a
    clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE in
    overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes
    mellitus. In July 2002, we announced that we had completed
    enrollment for two additional trials, each of which includes
    approximately 300 subjects, that are designed to evaluate
    the safety of intermittent treatment with AXOKINE and to study
    maintenance of weight loss following short-term treatment
    regimens. The Company announced in January 2003 that AXOKINE has
    received fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment
    of severely obese people who are unresponsive to, intolerant of,
    or unsuitable candidates for certain FDA-approved medicines for
    the long-term treatment of obesity.

•

INTERLEUKIN-1 CYTOKINE TRAP (IL-1 Trap):

Protein-based product candidate
    designed to bind the Interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine and
    prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors. IL-1 is
    thought to play a major role in rheumatoid arthritis and other
    inflammatory diseases. In July 2002, we announced the initiation
    of a dose-ranging Phase II trial that will involve
    approximately 200 participants to study the safety and efficacy
    of the IL-1 Trap in people with rheumatoid arthritis.



In addition to the above programs which we are
conducting independent of any corporate partners, we have formed
collaborations to advance other research and development
efforts. We are conducting research with The Procter &
Gamble Company in muscle diseases and other fields. We are also
collaborating with Medarex, Inc. to discover, develop, and
commercialize certain human antibodies as therapeutics. In
partnership with Amgen, we have development rights to
Neurotrophin-3, or NT-3, a clinical compound for the treatment
of constipating conditions, although there are no ongoing
development activities for NT-3 at this time. In all of these
research collaborations, we retain 50% of the commercialization
rights.

We have not received revenue from the
commercialization of our product candidates and may never
receive such revenues. Before revenues from the
commercialization of our product candidates can be realized, we
(or our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which
include successfully completing our research and development
efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA or
regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving
and highly competitive, and new developments may render our
products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through
December 31, 2002, we had a cumulative loss of
$424.1 million. In the absence of revenues from the
commercialization of our product candidates or other sources,
the amount, timing, nature, or source of which cannot be
predicted, our losses will continue as we conduct our research
and development activities. Our activities may expand over time
and may require additional resources and we expect our operating
losses to be substantial over at least the next several years.
Our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will
depend, among other factors, on the timing of certain expenses
and on the progress of our research and development efforts.



Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Our total revenue was
$22.0 million in both 2002 and 2001. Contract research and
development revenue decreased to $10.9 million in 2002 from
$12.1 million in 2001 as revenue from Amgen-Regeneron
Partners decreased from $1.2 million in 2001 to
approximately $2,000 in 2002, due to the completion of studies
conducted on behalf of the partnership. Under our long-term
collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble, research
payments, which are included in contract research and
development revenue, were $2.5 million per quarter (before
adjustments for inflation) in both 2002 and 2001. Contract
manufacturing revenue relates primarily to our long-term
agreement with Merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at
our Rensselaer, New York facility. In 2002, contract
manufacturing revenue increased to $11.1 million from
$9.9 million in 2001, due primarily to the receipt of a
non-recurring $1.0 million payment related to services we
provided to Merck in prior years. We shipped similar quantities
of intermediate to Merck in 2002 and 2001. Revenue and the
related manufacturing expense are recognized as the product is
shipped, after acceptance by Merck.

Our total operating expenses increased to
$143.9 million in 2002 from $107.7 million in 2001.
Research and development expenses increased to
$124.9 million in 2002 from $91.5 million in 2001,
primarily due to expansion of our clinical development programs,
especially our Phase III clinical program for AXOKINE which
we initiated in July 2001 and our Phase II clinical program
for IL-1 Trap which we initiated in July 2002. We also
expanded our research programs in 2002, principally related to
our proprietary Velocigene

TM

technology platform.
Research and development expenses were 87% of total operating
expenses in 2002, compared to 85% in 2001. Contract
manufacturing expenses were $6.5 million in both 2002 and
2001 primarily because we shipped similar quantities of product
to Merck each year. General and administrative expenses
increased to $12.5 million in 2002 from $9.6 million
in 2001, due primarily to higher administrative staffing to
support the growth of the company and higher fees paid to
outside service providers, including higher patent prosecution
and legal expenses related to the expansion of our intellectual
property portfolio.

Investment income decreased to $9.5 million
in 2002 from $13.2 million in 2001 due to lower effective
interest rates on investment securities during the full year
2002 and lower levels of interest-bearing investments in the
fourth quarter of 2002, compared to the fourth quarter of 2001,
as we funded our operations. Our share of the loss in
Amgen-Regeneron Partners decreased to approximately $27,000 in
2002, compared to $1.0 million in 2001, due to the
completion of studies conducted on behalf of the partnership.
Interest expense increased to $11.9 million in 2002 from
$2.7 million in 2001, due to interest incurred on the
$200 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
senior subordinated notes that we issued in October 2001. These
notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable semi-annually.

Our net loss in 2002 was $124.4 million, or
$2.83 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of
$76.2 million, or $1.81 per share (basic and diluted), in
2001.

Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Our total revenue decreased to
$22.0 million in 2001 from $59.3 million in 2000.
Contract research and development revenue decreased to
$12.1 million in 2001 from $36.5 million in 2000.
Under our long-term collaboration agreement with Procter &
Gamble, research payments decreased effective in the first
quarter of 2001 to $2.5 million per quarter (before
adjustments for inflation) from $7.1 million per quarter
for the first two quarters of 2000 and $6.8 million per
quarter for last two quarters of 2000. In addition, revenue from
Amgen-Regeneron Partners decreased to $1.2 million in 2001
from $6.2 million in 2000 due to the cessation of clinical
trial activity on brain derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, in
January 2001 and the substantial completion of our Phase II
studies of NT-3. In 2000, research progress payments consisted
of two non-recurring payments totaling $3.5 million from
Procter & Gamble related to our long-term collaboration
agreement and a non-recurring payment of $3.0 million
(reduced by $0.3 million of Japanese withholding tax) from
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals related to the development of BDNF in
Japan. Contract manufacturing revenue decreased to
$9.9 million in 2001, compared to $16.6 million in
2000. Contract manufacturing revenue related to our long-term
agreement with Merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate
decreased to $9.8 million in 2001 from $12.5 million
in 2000, primarily because intermediate manufactured in the
second half of 2001 was not shipped to Merck until 2002. Revenue
and the related manufacturing expense are recognized as the
product is shipped, after acceptance by Merck. Contract



manufacturing revenue in 2000 also included
$4.1 million related to the manufacture of clinical
supplies of BDNF for Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in connection with
a research and development agreement. Production of BDNF
clinical supplies for Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals was discontinued
in January 2001.

Our total operating expenses increased to
$107.7 million in 2001 from $84.6 million in 2000.
Research and development expenses increased to
$91.5 million in 2001 from $60.6 million in 2000,
primarily as a result of higher staffing and increased activity
in our preclinical and clinical development programs. For
example, in July 2001, we initiated a Phase III clinical
program of AXOKINE for the treatment of obesity and in December
2000, we initiated a Phase I study of the IL-1 Trap.
Research and development expenses were 85% of total operating
expenses in 2001, compared to 72% in 2000. Contract
manufacturing expenses decreased to $6.5 million in 2001
from $15.6 million in 2000. In addition to the
above-described effect of not shipping vaccine intermediate
manufactured for Merck in the second half of 2001 until 2002,
the decrease was due, in part, to higher costs in 2000
associated with initiating commercial production at our
Rensselaer facility of both intermediate for Merck and BDNF for
clinical use by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals. General and
administrative expenses increased to $9.6 million in 2001
from $8.4 million in 2000, due primarily to higher
administrative staffing to support a larger and more diversified
company.

Investment income in 2001 increased to
$13.2 million from $8.5 million in 2000 due primarily
to interest earned on the net proceeds of $192.7 million
from our private placement of $200 million aggregate
principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in
October 2001 and $156.7 million from our public offering in
March and April 2001. The loss in Amgen-Regeneron Partners
decreased to $1.0 million in 2001 from $4.6 million in
2000 due to the partnership’s cessation of clinical trial
activity on BDNF in January 2001 and the substantial completion
of Phase II studies of NT-3. Interest expense increased to
$2.7 million in 2001 from $0.3 million in 2000 due to
interest incurred on the convertible notes issued in October
2001. These notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable
semi-annually.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, we changed our
method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform with the
guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

,
(SAB 101), effective as of January 1, 2000. The
cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 as of January 1,
2000 was to increase our net loss by $1.6 million, or $0.04
per share, with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue
that is being recognized in subsequent periods. The SAB 101
adjustment relates to a portion of a 1989 payment received from
Sumitomo Chemical in consideration for a fifteen year limited
right of first negotiation to license up to three of our product
candidates in Japan. In 2001 and 2000, we recognized contract
research and development revenue of $0.4 million per year
that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of
January 1, 2000.

Our net loss in 2001 was $76.2 million, or
$1.81 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of
$23.2 million, or $0.66 per share (basic and diluted), in
2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our
operations primarily through offerings of our equity securities,
a private placement of convertible debt, revenue earned under
our agreements with Amgen, Sumitomo Chemical, Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals, Merck, and Procter & Gamble, and investment
income.

In May 1997, we entered into a long-term
collaboration agreement with Procter and Gamble. In connection
with the collaboration, Procter & Gamble made equity
purchases in Regeneron of $42.9 million in June 1997 and
$17.1 million in August 2000, and agreed to provide funding
in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration,
of which we have received $69.5 million through
December 31, 2002. In August 2000, Procter &
Gamble made two non-recurring research progress payments to us
totaling $3.5 million.

Effective December 31, 2000, we and
Procter & Gamble entered into a new long-term
collaboration agreement, replacing the companies’ 1997
agreement. The new agreement extends Procter & Gamble’s
obligation to fund Regeneron’s research through December
2005, with no further research obligations by either party
thereafter, and focuses the companies’ collaborative
research on therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to
Procter & Gamble. Under the new agreement, beginning in
the first quarter of 2001,



research support from Procter & Gamble
is $2.5 million per quarter, before adjustments for
inflation, through December 2005.

Our activities relating to NT-3, as agreed upon
by Amgen and us, are being compensated by Amgen-Regeneron
Partners for services rendered, and we recognize these amounts
as revenue. The partnership is not conducting ongoing
development activities for NT-3 at this time. In January 2001,
Amgen-Regeneron Partners discontinued all development of BDNF
for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or
ALS. We and Amgen fund Amgen-Regeneron Partners through capital
contributions, and must make equal payments in order to maintain
equal ownership and equal sharing of any profits or losses from
the partnership. Our aggregate capital contribution to
Amgen-Regeneron Partners from the partnership’s inception
in June 1993 through December 31, 2001 was
$57.9 million. In 2002, we made no capital contributions to
the partnership and received a capital withdrawal of
$0.5 million. At December 31, 2002, we continue to be
an equal partner in the Amgen-Regeneron Partners. We do not
expect to make capital contributions to the partnership in 2003.
Additional contributions may be required, depending upon, among
other things, whether and how Amgen-Regeneron Partners proceeds
with the development of NT-3.

In connection with our agreement to collaborate
with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in the research and development of
BDNF in Japan, we received a research progress payment from
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals of $3.0 million (reduced by
$0.3 million Japanese withholding tax) in April 2000. In
addition, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals paid us $32.0 million
through December 31, 2001 in connection with supplying BDNF
for preclinical and clinical use. In light of the
discontinuation of BDNF development for ALS, no payments from
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals were received in 2002 and we do not
expect to receive further payments related to BDNF for research
progress payments, contract research and development, or
contract manufacturing.

In December 2002, we entered into an agreement
with Serono S.A. to use our proprietary VelocigeneTM technology
to provide Serono with knock-out and transgenic mammalian models
of gene function. Under the terms of this agreement, Serono will
pay us up to $3.0 million annually for up to five years. In
return, we will use Velocigene to provide Serono with knock-out
transgenic models for target genes to be identified by Serono.

In April 2000, we completed a public offering of
2.6 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $29.75 per
share and received proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of
$72.9 million. In August 2000, we sold 573,630 shares
of Common Stock to Procter & Gamble at a price of $29.75 per
share and received total proceeds of $17.1 million. The
sale of stock to Procter & Gamble was made pursuant to
a 1997 securities purchase agreement. In March 2001, we
completed a public offering in which we issued 6.5 million
shares of Common Stock at a price of $25.00 per share and
received proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of
$153.6 million. In April 2001, we sold an additional
130,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
underwriters’ over-allotment option from the March 2001
public offering at a price of $25.00 per share and received
proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of $3.1 million.

In October 2001, we issued $200.0 million
aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated
notes in a private placement and received proceeds, after
deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and
out-of-pocket expenses, of $192.7 million. The notes bear
interest at 5.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in
2008. The notes are convertible into shares of our Common Stock
at a conversion price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances. We may redeem the notes,
in whole or in part, at any time before October 17, 2004,
if the closing price of our Common Stock has exceeded 150% of
the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of
time. Upon any such redemption, we are required to pay interest
that would have been due up through October 17, 2004. We
may also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after
October 17, 2004, if the closing price of our Common Stock
has exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in effect for a
specified period of time. We pledged $31.6 million of U.S.
government securities which will be sufficient upon receipt of
scheduled principal and interest payments to provide for the
payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on
the notes when due. The first two interest payments were made in
2002 and at December 31, 2002, $21.5 million of
U.S. government securities remain pledged to provide for
the payment in full of the next four scheduled interest payments
on the notes.



Our total expenses for research and development
from inception through December 31, 2002 have been
approximately $585 million. We have not historically
segregated all the costs associated with each of our research
programs and it is not possible to forecast their success or the
amounts that we may spend in the future. We currently have
research collaboration agreements with Procter &
Gamble, Medarex, Emisphere Technologies, Inc., Amgen and
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals. In 2002, 2001, and 2000, total
expenses for research programs conducted under our third-party
collaboration agreements were approximately $10 million,
$12 million, and $31 million, respectively. The
remainder of our research and development expenses in those
years related to our own internal research programs. We are
currently only committed to incur research expenditures under
our research collaboration agreements through the end of 2005
and estimate that, based on current plans, future expenditures
under these collaborations will total less than $50 million.

At December 31, 2002, we had
$295.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities, and restricted marketable securities. We have no
off-balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the
obligations of any other entity. As of December 31, 2002,
we had no established banking arrangements through which we
could obtain short-term financing or a line of credit. We may
seek additional funding through, among other things, future
collaboration agreements and public or private financing. We
cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to
us or, if available, that it will be available on acceptable
terms.

Our additions to property, plant, and equipment
totaled $45.9 million in 2002, $9.5 million in 2001,
and $6.5 million in 2000, including $33.8 million in
2002 and $2.1 million in 2001 related to the expansion of
our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York. In
connection with the original purchase and renovation of our
Rensselaer facility, we obtained financing of $2.0 million
from the New York State Urban Development Corporation. The
outstanding balance on this note of $1.5 million was fully
repaid in October 2001.

We expect to incur substantial funding
requirements for, among other things, research and development
activities (including preclinical and clinical testing),
expansion and validation of manufacturing facilities, and the
acquisition of equipment. We currently anticipate that in 2003,
approximately 30-50% of our expenditures will be directed toward
the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates,
including AXOKINE, IL-1 Trap, IL-4/13 Trap, VEGF Trap, and the
angiopoietins; approximately 10-20% of our expenditures will be
invested in expansion of our manufacturing facilities;
approximately 10-20% of our expenditures will cover our basic
research activities; approximately 5-15% of our expenditures
will be directed toward the continued development of our novel
technology platforms, including potential efforts to
commercialize these technologies; and the remainder of our
expenditures will be for general corporate purposes, including
working capital. In 2003, we expect to incur approximately
$50 million in capital expenditures for our expanded
manufacturing, research and development activities.

In connection with our funding requirements, the
following table summarizes our contractual obligations for
leases and long-term debt.

(1)

Includes amounts representing interest.

(2)

Excludes future contingent rental costs for
    utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. In 2002,
    these costs were $3.6 million.

In the future, if we are able to successfully
develop, market, and sell certain of our product candidates, we
may be required to pay royalties on such sales in connection
with our collaboration and licensing agreements.



We expect that expenses related to the filing,
prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patent and other
intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as
a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the United States
and foreign countries.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend
on various factors, including the status of competitive
products, the success of our research and development programs,
the potential future need to expand our professional and support
staff and facilities, the status of patents and other
intellectual property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical
trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the
continuation, extent, and success of any collaborative research
arrangements (including those with Procter & Gamble,
Medarex, Emisphere, and Amgen). Clinical trial costs are
dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of
trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial
investigators and other third parties, the costs for
manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials,
supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of
funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends
upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and
early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the
clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we
decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost
of each trial as described above. We believe that our existing
capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through
mid-2004. However, this is a forward-looking statement based on
our current operating plan, and we cannot assure you that there
will be no change in projected revenues or expenses that would
lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such
time. If there is insufficient capital to fund all of our
planned operations and activities, we believe we would
prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical
development of our product candidates. In the event we need
additional financing for the operation of our business, we will
consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or
private financing, including additional equity financing.
Factors influencing the availability of additional financing
include our progress in product development, investor perception
of our prospects and the general condition of the financial
markets.

Critical Accounting Policies

We recognize revenue from contract research and
development and research progress payments as we perform
services or as contract research materials are accepted and meet
specifications, provided a contractual arrangement exists, the
contract price is fixed or determinable, and our collection of
the resulting receivable is probable. In situations where we
receive advance payments for contract research and development,
these amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as we
perform the related services or as contract research materials
are accepted and meet specifications. Non-refundable fees,
including payments we receive for services, up-front licensing
fees, technology fees, and research progress payments, are
recognized as revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred
to date, estimated costs to complete, and total expected
contract revenue. However, the revenue we recognize is limited
to the amount of non-refundable fees received. Non-refundable
fees that we receive in consideration for granting collaborators
the right to license product candidates developed by us are
recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of
the underlying agreements. This policy conforms with guidance
provided by SAB 101. With regard to our revenues from
non-refundable fees, we do not believe that changes in our
assumptions of estimated costs to complete would have a material
impact on the revenues we have recognized.

We have entered into a contract manufacturing
agreement with Merck under which we manufacture a vaccine
intermediate at our Rensselaer, New York facility and perform
services. We recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this
agreement after the product is tested and approved by, and
shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck, and as services are
performed. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to modify
portions of our Rensselaer facility to manufacture Merck’s
vaccine intermediate and Merck agreed to reimburse us for the
related capital costs. These capital cost payments were deferred
and are recognized as revenue as product is shipped to Merck,
based upon our estimate of Merck’s order quantities each
year through the expected end of the agreement. Since we
commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in November
1999, our estimates of Merck’s order quantities each year
have not been materially different from Merck’s actual
orders.

Research and development expenses include costs
directly attributable to the conduct of our research and
development programs, including salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation



on and maintenance of research equipment, costs
related to research collaboration and licensing agreements, the
cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
services related to our clinical trials, clinical trial
expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, expenses
related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to
commencing commercial production of a product under contract
manufacturing arrangements, and the allocable portions of
facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and
maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All
costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.

For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain
clinical trial costs, which are included in research and
development expenses, are expensed based on the expected total
number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients
enter the trial, and the period over which clinical
investigators or contract research organizations are expected to
provide services. We believe that this method best aligns the
expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical
trial. We adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if
actual results differ from our estimates.

Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146 (“SFAS No. 146”)

Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

. SFAS
No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).

SFAS
No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated
with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred rather than on the date of an
entity’s commitment to an exit plan and establishes that
fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the
liability. The provisions of this Statement shall be effective
for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. Our management believes that the future
adoption of this accounting standard will not have a material
impact on our financial statements.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 (“SFAS No. 148”),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure — an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123

. SFAS No. 148 provides several
transition provisions that may be used upon adoption of the
accounting provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (“SFAS No. 123”),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. SFAS
No. 148 also mandates certain new disclosures, whether or
not SFAS No. 123 is adopted, that are incremental to those
required by SFAS No. 123. Those disclosures must be made in
both interim and annual financial statements. The transition and
annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, and have
been adopted in this annual report on Form 10-K. The new
interim disclosure provisions will be adopted in our quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31,
2003 and, our management believes, will not have a material
impact on our financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB Emerging Issue Task
Force finalized Issue No. 00-21
(“EITF 00-21”)

Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

, which addresses how
to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting.
EITF 00-21 also addresses how arrangement consideration
should be measured and allocated to the separate units of
accounting in the arrangement. The guidance in EITF 00-21
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Our management
believes that the adoption of this accounting standard will not
have a material impact on our financial statements.

Factors That May Affect Future Operating
Results

We caution shareholders and potential investors
that the following important factors, among others, in some
cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual
results and could cause our actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by,
or on behalf of, us. The statements under this caption are
intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
following information is not intended to limit in any way the



characterization of other statements or
information under other captions as cautionary statements for
such purpose:



As our scientific efforts lead to potentially
promising new directions, both outside of recombinant protein
therapies and into conditions or diseases outside of our current
areas of experience and expertise, we will require additional
internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which
we currently do not have substantial resources and personnel.

Other parties could allege to have blocking
patents covering any of our product candidates in clinical
and/or pre-clinical development. For example, we are aware of
certain United States and foreign patents held by third parties
relating to particular IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. In addition, we
are aware of a European patent that pertains to the use of CNTF
for the treatment of obesity.

We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in
our judgment, such licenses are needed. If any licenses are
required, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain
any such license could prevent us from developing or
commercializing one or more of our product candidates, which
could severely harm our business.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual
property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the
outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued
or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court
may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third
parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the
development of our products or pay license fees or royalties to
take into account patent rights of third parties.

To date, we have received revenues from
(1) our licensees and collaborators for research and
development efforts, (2) Merck and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals
for contract manufacturing, and (3) investment income. We
may not continue to receive these revenues from our licensees,
collaborators, or contract manufacturing customers. In the
absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product
candidates or other sources, our losses will continue as we
conduct our research and development activities. Our activities
may expand over time and may require additional resources, and
our operating losses may be substantial over at least the next
several years. Our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter
and will depend, among other factors, on the timing of certain
expenses and on the progress of our research and development
efforts. We do



not know if we will ever have an approved product
or achieve significant revenues or profitable operations. We do
not expect to receive any revenue from the commercialization of
our product candidates for several years and we intend to
continue to invest significantly in our research and development
activities. Even if we do successfully develop products that can
be marketed and sold commercially, we will need to generate
significant revenue from products to achieve and maintain
profitability.

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients
report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries,
and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not
possible to determine whether or not these conditions are caused
by the drug being studied. Various illnesses, injuries, and
discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during the
clinical trials of AXOKINE, our only product candidate that has
completed Phase II trials. In the ongoing Phase III
study of AXOKINE, one patient was reported to have been
diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome following an upper
respiratory tract infection. The most frequently reported
conditions during the AXOKINE Phase II trial were injection
site reactions, cough, and nausea or vomiting. During the Phase
I study that was conducted in 1999, some subjects developed
mouth sores, also known as cold sores, when AXOKINE was given in
higher doses than what is being studied in the Phase III
program. These cold sores were thought to be caused by the
reactivation of herpes simplex virus, or HSV. Recurrence of HSV
was also reported in previous clinical studies of CNTF,
AXOKINE’s parent molecule. In the Phase I AXOKINE study,
one patient who had evidence of previous exposure to HSV prior
to treatment and had been previously diagnosed with Bell’s
palsy, had a recurrence of Bell’s palsy approximately two
weeks after the patient’s last administration of AXOKINE.

Although AXOKINE was generally well tolerated in
the completed Phase II trial, it is possible that as we
test AXOKINE in a large and extended Phase III program,
illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were observed in the
earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went
undetected in these smaller trials, will be reported by
patients. If additional clinical experience indicates that
AXOKINE has many side effects or causes serious or
life-threatening side effects, the development of AXOKINE may
fail or be delayed, which would severely harm our business.

Most drug research and development programs never
lead to the development of commercially successful products.
Only a small minority of all research and development programs
ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We are
attempting to develop drugs for human therapeutic uses, and our
research and development activities may not be successful and
none of our potential product candidates may ever complete
clinical trials. Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and
efficacy of our product candidates and the necessary regulatory
approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any of our
product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by
patients, the medical community, and third-party payors and on
our ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market our
product candidates. If our products are not successfully
commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant
investment we have made in developing such products and our
business would be severely harmed.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to
fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our
investment of available cash balances in investment grade
corporate and U.S. government securities. We do not believe we
are materially exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our
current policies we do not use interest rate derivative
instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We
estimate that a one percent change in interest rates would
result in an approximately $0.7 million change in the fair
market value of our investment portfolio at December 31,
2002.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

In our opinion, based upon our audits and the
report of other auditors, the accompanying balance sheets and
the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
“Company”) at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of Amgen-Regeneron Partners (the
“Partnership”), an entity which is fifty percent owned
by the Company, as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the
two years in the period ended December 31, 2001. The
Company’s investment in the Partnership is accounted for in
accordance with the equity method of accounting. At
December 31, 2001, its investment constitutes less than one
percent of the Company’s assets. For the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded its pro
rata share of the Partnership’s net loss of approximately
$1.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The
Partnership’s financial statements were audited by other
auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our
opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for the Partnership, is based solely on the report of
the other auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, during the year ended December 31, 2000, the
Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002,

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

1.     Organization
and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
“Company” or “Regeneron”) was incorporated
in January 1988 in the State of New York. The Company is engaged
in research and development programs to discover and
commercialize therapeutics to treat human disorders and
conditions. The Company’s facilities are located in New
York. The Company’s business is subject to certain risks
including, but not limited to, uncertainties relating to
conducting pharmaceutical research, obtaining regulatory
approvals, commercializing products, and obtaining and enforcing
patents.

2.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Property, Plant, and
    Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the
useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred.
The cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets
retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and
any gain or loss is recognized in operations. The estimated
useful lives of property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

6-30 years

Leasehold improvements

Life of lease

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Costs of construction of certain long-lived
assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the
estimated useful life of the related asset. The Company
capitalized interest costs of $0.2 million in 2002.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and
the balance sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported
in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates
its fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined based on standards that approximate
the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are shown net of
applicable reserves.

Revenue
Recognition and Change in Accounting Principle

a.

Contract Research and Development and Research
    Progress Payments

On January 1, 2000, the Company changed its
method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform with the
guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

(“SAB
101”). Effective January 1, 2000, the Company
recognizes revenue from contract research and development and
research progress payments as services are performed or as
contract research materials are accepted and meet
specifications, provided a contractual arrangement exists, the
contract price is fixed or determinable, and the collection of
the resulting receivable is probable. In situations where the
Company receives advance payment for contract research and
development, such amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue
as services are performed or as contract research materials are
accepted and meet specifications. Gross margin on contract
research and development revenue is immaterial. Non-refundable
fees, including payments for services, up-front licensing fees,
technology fees, and research progress payments (collectively,

F-8


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

“Non-refundable Fees”), are recognized
as revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date,
estimated costs to complete, and total expected contract
revenue. However, revenue recognized is limited to the amount of
Non-refundable Fees received. Non-refundable Fees received in
consideration for granting collaborators the right to license
product candidates developed by the Company are recognized as
revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying
agreements.

Prior to January 1, 2000, the Company
recognized revenue as described above, except that certain
Non-refundable Fees were recognized as revenue when there were
no additional contractual services to be provided or costs to be
incurred by the Company in connection with the Non-refundable
Fee.

The cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 at
January 1, 2000 amounted to $1.6 million of additional
loss, with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue that is
being recognized in subsequent periods, of which
$0.4 million was included in contract research and
development revenue in each of 2002, 2001, and 2000. The
$1.6 million represents a portion of a 1989 payment
received from Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. in consideration for a
fifteen year limited right of first negotiation to license up to
three of the Company’s product candidates in Japan (see
Note 10b). The effect of income taxes on the cumulative effect
adjustment was immaterial.

b.

Contract Manufacturing

The Company has entered into contract
manufacturing agreements under which it manufactures products
and performs services for third parties. Contract manufacturing
revenue is recognized as products are shipped and as services
are performed (see Notes 10b and 11).

Investment
Income

Interest income, which is included in investment
income, is recognized as earned.

Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, are
reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Estimated
undiscounted expected future cash flows are used to determine if
an asset is impaired in which case the asset’s carrying
value would be reduced to fair value. For all periods presented,
no impairment losses were recorded.

Patents

As a result of the Company’s research and
development efforts, it has obtained, applied, or is applying
for a number of patents to protect proprietary technology and
inventions. All costs associated with patents are expensed as
incurred.

Research and
Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs
directly attributable to the conduct of research and development
programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
collaboration and licensing agreements (see Note 9e), the cost
of services provided by outside contractors, including services
related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical trial
expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, expenses
related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to
commencing commercial production of a product under contract
manufacturing arrangements, and the allocable portions of
facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and
maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All
costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.

F-9


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

For each clinical trial that the Company
conducts, certain clinical trial costs, which are included in
research and development expenses, are expensed based on the
expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at
which patients enter the trial, and the period over which
clinical investigators or contract research organizations are
expected to provide services. The Company adjusts its rate of
clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from the
Company’s estimates.

Net Loss Per
Share

Net loss per share, basic and diluted, is
computed on the basis of the net loss for the period divided by
the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
Class A Stock outstanding during the period. The diluted
net loss per share for all periods presented excludes the number
of shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible
debt and exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants,
since such inclusion would be antidilutive. Disclosures required
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share

, have been included in Note 16.

Income
Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets
are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial
reporting amounts (“temporary differences”) at enacted
tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for
deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain. See Note
14.

Comprehensive
Loss

Comprehensive loss represents the change in net
assets of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. Comprehensive loss of the Company includes net loss
adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or loss on
marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
comprehensive loss is immaterial. Comprehensive losses for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 have been
included in the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted marketable
securities, and receivables from The Procter & Gamble
Company and Merck & Co., Inc. The Company generally invests
its excess cash in obligations of the U.S. government and its
agencies, bank deposits, investment grade debt securities issued
by corporations, governments, and financial institutions, and
money market funds that invest in these instruments. The Company
has established guidelines that relate to credit quality,
diversification, and maturity, and that limit exposure to any
one issue of securities.

Risks and
Uncertainties

Regeneron has had no sales of its products and
there is no assurance that the Company’s research and
development efforts will be successful, that the Company will
ever have commercially approved products, or that the Company
will achieve significant sales of any such products. In January
2001, Amgen-Regeneron Partners, a partnership equally owned by
the Company and Amgen Inc., discontinued all clinical
development of one product following notification that the
product did not provide a therapeutic advantage to patients in
clinical trials (see Note 10a). The Company has incurred
net losses and negative cash flows from operations since its
inception, and revenues to date have been limited to payments
for research from four collaborators

and for contract manufacturing from two
pharmaceutical companies and investment income (see
Notes 10 and 11). The Company operates in an environment of
rapid change in technology and is dependent upon the services of
its employees, consultants, collaborators, and certain
third-party suppliers of materials. Regeneron, as licensee,
licenses certain technologies that are important to the
Company’s business which impose various obligations on the
Company. If Regeneron fails to comply with these requirements,
licensors may have the right to terminate the Company’s
licenses.

Contract research and development revenue in 2002
was primarily earned from The Procter & Gamble Company under
a long-term collaboration agreement (see Note 10d). Procter
& Gamble is obligated to provide payments to fund Regeneron
research of $2.5 million per quarter, before adjustments
for inflation, through December 2005, with no further research
obligations by either party thereafter. Contract manufacturing
revenue in 2002 was earned from Merck & Co., Inc. under a
long-term manufacturing agreement that is expected to extend
until November 2005 (see Note 11). Merck may terminate the
agreement with at least one year’s notice without penalty.

The Company has entered into a license and supply
agreement with Nektar Therapeutics under which Nektar is the
only supplier of a pegylated reagent used to formulate pegylated
AXOKINE, one of our product candidates.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Stock-based
Employee Compensation

The accompanying financial position and results
of operations of the Company have been prepared in accordance
with APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

(“APB No. 25”). Under APB
No. 25, generally, no compensation expense is recognized in
the accompanying financial statements in connection with the
awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as
of the grant date, all terms associated with the award are fixed
and the quoted market price of the Company’s stock, as of
the grant date, is equal to or less than the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock as defined.

The Company has stock-based incentive plans,
which are more fully described in Note 12a. The following table
illustrates the effect on the Company’s net loss and net
loss per share had compensation costs for the incentive plans
been determined in accordance with the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based compensation as prescribed by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS
No. 123”). Since option grants awarded during 2002,
2001, and 2000 vest over several years and additional awards are
expected to be issued in the future, the pro forma results shown
below are not likely to be representative of the effects on
future years of the application of the fair value based method.

Statement of
Cash Flows

Supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and
financing activities:

In 2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company awarded
139,611, 80,535, and 34,785 shares, respectively, of Restricted
Stock under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Long-Term
Incentive Plan (see Note 12a). The Company records unearned
compensation in Stockholders’ Equity related to these
awards based on the fair market value of shares of the
Company’s Common Stock on the grant date of the Restricted
Stock award, which is expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the
approximately two year period that the restrictions on these
shares lapse. In 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized
$1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of
compensation expense related to Restricted Stock awards. No
stock-based compensation expense was recognized in 2000.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses
at December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were
$13.5 million, $1.9 million, and $0.7 million of
capital expenditures, respectively.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses
at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 were
$0.8 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million,
respectively, of accrued 401(k) Savings Plan contribution

Company contributed 21,953, 17,484, and 54,003 shares,
respectively, of Common Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in
satisfaction of these obligations.

Included in marketable securities at
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $2.0 million,
$2.0 million, and $2.3 million of accrued interest
income, respectively.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the

Future Impact
of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146 (“SFAS No. 146”),

Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

. SFAS
No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a

F-12


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

Restructuring)

. SFAS
No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated
with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred rather than on the date of an
entity’s commitment to an exit plan and establishes that
fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the
liability. The provisions of this Statement shall be effective
for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. Management believes that the future
adoption of this accounting standard will not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 (“SFAS No. 148”),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure — an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123

. SFAS No. 148 provides several
transition provisions that may be used upon adoption of the
accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 148
also mandates certain new disclosures, whether or not SFAS
No. 123 is adopted, that are incremental to those required
by SFAS No. 123. Those disclosures must be made in both interim
and annual financial statements. The transition and annual
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, and have been
adopted in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The new interim
disclosure provisions will be adopted in the Company’s
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending
March 31, 2003 and, management believes, will not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB Emerging Issue Task
Force finalized Issue No. 00-21
(“EITF 00-21”)

Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

, which addresses how
to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting.
EITF 00-21 also addresses how arrangement consideration
should be measured and allocated to the separate units of
accounting in the arrangement. The guidance in EITF 00-21
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Management believes
that the adoption of this accounting standard will not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

3.     Marketable
Securities

The Company considers its unrestricted marketable
securities to be “available-for-sale,” as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

8.     Stockholders’
Equity

The Company’s Amended Certificate of
Incorporation provides for the issuance of up to 40 million
shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and
160 million shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share. Shares of Class A Stock are convertible, at any
time, at the option of the holder into shares of Common Stock on
a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class A Stock have
rights and privileges identical to Common Stockholders except
that Class A Stockholders are entitled to ten votes per
share, while Common Stockholders are entitled to one vote per
share. Class A Stock may only be transferred to specified
Permitted Transferees, as defined. The Company’s Board of
Directors (the “Board”) is authorized to issue up to
30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined
by the Board.

During 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan in which Rights were distributed as a dividend at
the rate of one Right for each share of Common Stock and
Class A Stock (collectively, “Stock”) held by
shareholders of record as of the close of business on
October 18, 1996. Each Right initially entitles the
registered holder to buy a unit (“Unit”) consisting of
one-one thousandth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (“A Preferred Stock”) at
a purchase price of $120 per Unit (the “Purchase
Price”). Initially the Rights were attached to all Stock
certificates representing shares then outstanding, and no
separate Rights certificates were distributed. The Rights will
separate from the Stock and a “distribution date” will
occur upon the earlier of (i) ten days after a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons, excluding certain defined persons, (an “Acquiring
Person”) has acquired, or has obtained the right to
acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Stock or (ii) ten business days following the
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would
result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of
such outstanding shares of Stock. The Rights are not exercisable
unless a distribution date occurs and will expire at the close
of business on October 18, 2006 unless earlier redeemed by
the Company, subject to certain defined restrictions, for $.01
per Right. In the event that an Acquiring Person becomes the
beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares
of Stock (unless such acquisition is made pursuant to a tender
or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of the Company, at
a price determined by a majority of the independent directors of
the Company who are not representatives, nominees, affiliates,
or associates of an Acquiring Person to be fair and otherwise in
the best interest of the Company and its shareholders after
receiving advice from one or more investment banking firms),
each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the
Right’s then current exercise price, common shares (or, in
certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the
Company) having a value twice the Right’s Exercise Price.
The Right’s Exercise Price is the Purchase Price times the
number of shares of Common Stock associated with each Right
(initially, one). Upon the occurrence of any such events, the

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

Rights held by an Acquiring Person become null
and void. In certain circumstances, a Right entitles the holder
to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock of an
acquiring company having a value equal to two times the
Right’s Exercise Price.

As a result of the Shareholder Rights Plan, the
Company’s Board designated 100,000 shares of preferred
stock as A Preferred Stock. The A Preferred Stock has
certain preferences, as defined.

In April 2000, the Company completed a public
offering of 2.6 million shares of Common Stock at a price
of $29.75 per share for net proceeds, after commissions and
expenses, of $72.9 million. In March and April 2001, the
Company completed a public offering in which it issued
6.63 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $25.00
per share and received proceeds, after commissions and expenses,
of $156.7 million.

In March 2001, Medtronic, Inc. exercised 107,400
warrants with an exercise price of $21.72 per share on a
“cashless” basis and received 37,306 shares of
the Company’s Common Stock.

In October 2001, the Company completed a private
placement of $200 million aggregate principal amount of
senior subordinated notes, which are convertible into shares of
the Company’s Common Stock. See Note 9d.

and Contingencies

a.     Operating
Leases

The Company leases and subleases laboratory,
manufacturing, and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York
under operating lease agreements which expire through December
2006 and contain renewal options to extend the leases on certain
facilities through December 2014. The Company also leases
manufacturing, office, and warehouse facilities in Rensselaer,
New York under an operating lease agreement which expires in
July 2007 and contains renewal options to extend the lease for
two additional five-year terms and a purchase option. The leases
provide for base rent plus additional rental charges for
utilities, taxes, and operating expenses, as defined.

The Company leases certain laboratory and office
equipment under operating leases which expire at various times
through 2006.

At December 31, 2002, the future minimum
noncancelable lease commitments under operating leases were as
follows:

Rent expense under operating leases was:

$3.6 million, $3.0 million, and $2.1 million for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.

b.     Capital
Leases

The Company leases equipment under noncancelable
capital leases. Lease terms are generally four years after
which, for certain leases, the Company purchases the equipment
at amounts defined by the agreements.

As of December 31, 2002, one capital lease
remains outstanding, with minimum rental payments as follows:

Leased equipment and building improvements
included in property, plant, and equipment was $1.1 million
and $1.6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively; related accumulated depreciation was
$0.9 million and $1.1 million for the same respective
periods.

c.     Note
Payable

In 1994, the Company borrowed $2.0 million
from the New York State Urban Development Corporation. The terms
of the note provided for monthly payments of principal and
interest through December 2014. Outstanding borrowings accrued
interest at an effective interest rate of approximately 6.4%.
The note was collateralized by a first mortgage on the
Company’s land, building, and improvements in Rensselaer,
New York. In October 2001, the remaining principal balance on
this note of $1.5 million was paid in full.

d.     Convertible
Debt

In October 2001, the Company issued
$200 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
senior subordinated notes (“Notes”) in a private
placement for proceeds to the Company, after deducting the
initial purchasers’ discount and out-of-pocket expenses, of
$192.7 million. The Notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum,
payable semi-annually, and mature on October 17, 2008. The
Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder at any time,
into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion
price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to adjustment
in certain circumstances. Regeneron may redeem the Notes, in
whole or in part, at any time before October 17, 2004 if
the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock has
exceeded 150% of the conversion price then in effect for a
specified period of time (“Early Redemption”). Upon
any such Early Redemption, the Company is required to pay
interest that would have been due up through October 17,
2004. Regeneron may also redeem some or all of the Notes at any
time on or after October 17, 2004 if the closing price of
the Company’s Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the
conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time.
The fair market value of the Notes fluctuates over time. The
estimated fair value of the Notes at December 31, 2002 was
approximately $182.8 million.

With respect to the Notes, the Company pledged as
collateral $31.6 million of U.S. government securities
(“Restricted Marketable Securities”) with maturities
at various dates through October 2004. At December 31,
2002, the balance of the Restricted Marketable Securities had an
amortized cost basis of $21.5 million, due to scheduled
interest payments made on the Notes in 2002. Upon maturity, the
proceeds of the Restricted

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

Marketable Securities will be sufficient to pay
the scheduled interest payments on the Notes when due in 2003
and 2004. The Company considers its Restricted Marketable
Securities to be “held-to-maturity,” as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

. These securities are reported at their amortized
cost, which includes the direct costs to acquire the securities,
plus the amortization of any discount or premium, and accrued
interest earned on the securities.

The following table summarizes the amortized cost
basis and aggregate fair value of Restricted Marketable
Securities, and gross unrealized holding gains and losses, at
December 31, 2002 and 2001. Fair value has been estimated
based on quoted market prices.

e.     Research
Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company’s research and
development efforts, the Company enters into research
collaboration and licensing agreements with related and
unrelated companies, scientific collaborators, universities, and
consultants. The Company also has research collaborations with
Medarex, Inc. and Emisphere Technologies, Inc., and a license
and supply agreement with Nektar Therapeutics. These agreements
contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and
milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be provided,
and ownership rights to certain proprietary technology developed
under the agreements. Some of the agreements contain provisions
which require the Company to pay royalties, as defined, at rates
that range from 0.25% to 12%, in the event the Company sells or
licenses any proprietary products developed under the respective
agreements.

Certain agreements, where the Company is required
to pay fees, provide for the Company, upon 30 to 90-day written
notice, to terminate such agreements. With respect to payments
associated with these agreements, the Company incurred expenses
of $1.7 million, $1.1 million, and $0.6 million
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.

10.     Collaboration
Agreements

a.     Amgen
Inc.

In August 1990, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with
Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) to develop and attempt to
commercialize two proprietary products (BDNF and NT-3,
individually the “Product,” collectively the
“Products”). The Amgen Agreement, among other things,
provided for Amgen and the Company to form a partnership
(“Amgen-Regeneron Partners” or the
“Partnership”) to complete the development and to
commercialize the Products. Amgen and the Company hold equal
ownership interests (subject to adjustment for any future
inequities in capital contributions, as defined). The
Partnership is the exclusive distributor of Products in the
United States, and Amgen has received a license from the Company
to market the Products outside the United States and outside
Japan and certain Pacific Rim countries. The Company accounts
for its investment in the Partnership in accordance with the
equity method of accounting. In 2002, 2001, and 2000, the
Company recognized its share of the Partnership net loss in the
amounts of $27 thousand, $1.0 million, and
$4.6 million, respectively, which represents 50% of the
total Partnership net loss. In September 2002, the Company and
Amgen each made capital withdrawals of $0.5 million from
the Partnership. At December 31, 2002, the Company
continues to be an equal partner in the Partnership.

In January 2001, Amgen-Regeneron Partners
discontinued all clinical development of BDNF for the potential
treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”)
following notification that BDNF did not provide a therapeutic
advantage to ALS patients in clinical trials. The Partnership
has no ongoing development activities for NT-3 at this time.

Payments the Company receives from the
Partnership in connection with services provided to the
Partnership, are recognized as contract research and development
revenue as earned. Such revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 totaled $2 thousand,
$1.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively.

Selected financial data of the Partnership as of
December 31, 2001 and for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, are as follows. Selected balances as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2002 were insignificant.

(1)

Includes $0.2 million due the Company at
    December 31, 2001.

(2)

Includes $1.2 million and $6.2 million
    related to services provided by the Company in 2001 and 2000,
    respectively.

F-20


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

In October 2000, Amgen and Regeneron entered into
an agreement whereby Regeneron acquired Amgen’s patents and
patent applications relating to ciliary neurotrophic factor
(“CNTF”) and related molecules for $1.0 million.
As part of this agreement, Regeneron granted back to Amgen
exclusive, royalty free rights under these patents and patent
applications solely for human ophthalmic uses. In addition,
Regeneron entered into a covenant not to sue Amgen under
Regeneron’s patents and patent applications relating to
CNTF and related molecules solely for human ophthalmic uses.

In July 2002, Amgen and Immunex Corporation (now
part of Amgen) granted the Company a non-exclusive license to
certain patents and patent applications which may be used in the
development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap. The license
followed two other licensing arrangements under which Regeneron
obtained a non-exclusive license to patents owned by
ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Tularik Inc. for use in connection with
the IL-1 Trap program. These license agreements would require
the Company to pay royalties based on the net sales of the IL-1
Trap if and when it is approved for sale. In total, the royalty
rate under these three agreements would be in the mid-single
digits.

b.     Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals Company, Ltd.

In June 1994, the Company entered into a research
and development agreement (the “R&D Agreement”)
with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Company, Ltd. (“Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals”) to collaborate in the research and
development of BDNF in Japan. In connection with the R&D
Agreement, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals made payments to the Company
for its activities in developing and validating manufacturing
processes for BDNF, and manufacturing and supplying BDNF and
other research materials to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals. In 2001
and 2000, Regeneron recognized contract research and development
revenue from Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals of $0.1 million and
$0.8 million, respectively. In addition, the Company
recognized contract manufacturing revenue of $0.1 million
and $4.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, as
supplies of BDNF were received (FOB Destination Point) by
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals.

In connection with the R&D Agreement, in
August 1998, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals signed a license agreement
with the Company for the development of BDNF in Japan. Pursuant
to the license agreement, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals made a
research progress payment of $3.0 million (reduced by
$0.3 million of Japanese withholding tax) in April 2000.
The amount received in 2000 is included in research progress
payments. In light of the discontinuation of BDNF development
for ALS, the Company did not receive any payments from Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals for research progress payments, contract
research and development, or contract manufacturing in 2002 and
does not expect to receive payments related to the development
of BDNF in the future.

During 1989, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.
(“Sumitomo Chemical”), an affiliate of Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals, entered into a Technology Development Agreement
(“TDA”) with Regeneron and paid the Company
$5.6 million. In consideration for this payment, Sumitomo
Chemical received a fifteen year limited right of first
negotiation to license up to three of the Company’s product
candidates in Japan. In connection with the Company’s
implementation of SAB 101 (see Note 2), the Company is
recognizing this payment as revenue on a straight-line basis
over the term of the TDA.

c.     Glaxo
Wellcome plc

During 1993, the Company entered into a
collaborative research agreement with Glaxo Wellcome plc
(“Glaxo”). Products that are developed by the joint
efforts of Glaxo and the Company will be commercialized by one
or more equally owned joint ventures. Glaxo also purchased
500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of
$20 per share.

d.     The
Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, the Company entered into a long-term
collaboration agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company
(“P&G”) to discover, develop, and commercialize
pharmaceutical products (the “P&G

F-21


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

Agreement”) and P&G agreed to provide
funding for Regeneron’s research efforts related to the
collaboration. In connection with the collaboration, in June
1997 and August 2000, P&G purchased 4.35 million and
573,630 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at $9.87 and
$29.75 per share for a total of $42.9 million and
$17.1 million, respectively. In June 1997, P&G also
received five year warrants to purchase an additional
1.45 million shares of the Company’s stock at $9.87
per share, which were exercised in August 2000. As consideration
for the exercise price, P&G tendered 511,125 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock which had an aggregate value at the
time of exercise, based upon the average market price of the
Company’s Common Stock over approximately the prior 30
trading days, equal to the aggregate exercise price of the
warrants. The net result of this warrant exercise was that
P&G acquired an additional 938,875 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. The 511,125 shares of Common Stock
delivered to the Company by P&G were retired upon receipt.
These equity purchases were in addition to a purchase by Procter
& Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of 800,000 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock for $10.0 million that was
completed in March 1997.

Effective December 31, 2000, the Company and
P&G entered into a new collaboration agreement, replacing
the P&G Agreement. The new agreement extends P&G’s
obligation to fund Regeneron research through December 2005,
with no further research obligations by either party thereafter,
and focuses the companies’ collaborative research on
therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to P&G.
Under the new agreement, beginning in the first quarter of 2001,
research support from P&G is $2.5 million per quarter,
before adjustments for inflation, through December 2005. Any
drugs that result from the collaboration will continue to be
jointly developed and marketed worldwide, with the companies
equally sharing development costs and profits. P&G and the
Company have divided rights to programs from the P&G
Agreement that are no longer part of the companies’
collaboration. Research funding from P&G related to the
collaboration totaled $69.5 million through
December 31, 2002. In August 2000, P&G made two
research progress payments to Regeneron totaling
$3.5 million. In addition, in 1997 through 1999, P&G
also provided research support for the Company’s AXOKINE
program and, as a result, will be entitled to receive a small
royalty on any sales of AXOKINE.

Contract research and development revenue related
to the companies’ collaboration agreements was
$10.5 million, $10.4 million, and $28.3 million
in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. At December 31,
2002, 2001, and 2000, the P&G contract research revenue
receivable was $2.6 million, $2.7 million, and
$6.9 million, respectively.

11.     Manufacturing
Agreement

During 1995, the Company entered into a long-term
manufacturing agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., as amended,
(the “Merck Agreement”) to produce an intermediate
(the “Intermediate”) for a Merck pediatric vaccine at
the Company’s Rensselaer, New York facility. The Company
agreed to modify portions of its facility for manufacture of the
Intermediate and to assist Merck in securing regulatory approval
for such manufacture in the Company’s facility. The Merck
Agreement calls for the Company to manufacture Intermediate for
Merck for six years (the “Production Period”), with
certain minimum order quantities each year. The Production
Period commenced in November of 1999 and is expected to extend
until November 2005. Merck may terminate the agreement with at
least one year’s notice without payment of a termination
fee.

Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the
capital costs to modify the facility (“Capital
Costs”). Merck also agreed to pay an annual facility fee
(the “Facility Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning
March 1995, subject to annual adjustment for inflation. During
the Production Period, Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for
certain manufacturing costs, pay the Company a variable fee
based on the quantity of Intermediate supplied to Merck, and
make additional bi-annual payments (“Additional
Payments”), as defined. In addition, Merck agreed to
reimburse the Company for the cost of Company activities
performed on

F-22


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

behalf of Merck prior to the Production Period
and for miscellaneous costs during the Production Period
(“Internal Costs”). These payments are recognized as
contract manufacturing revenue as follows: (i) payments for
Internal Costs are recognized as the activities are performed,
(ii) the Facility Fee and Additional Payments are
recognized over the period to which they relate,
(iii) payments for Capital Costs were deferred and are
recognized as Intermediate is shipped to Merck, and
(iv) payments related to the manufacture of Intermediate
during the Production Period (“Manufacturing
Payments”) are recognized after the Intermediate is tested
and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck.

In 2002, 2001, and 2000, Merck contract
manufacturing revenue totaled $11.1 million,
$9.8 million, and $12.5 million, respectively. Such
amounts include $1.8 million, $1.8 million, and
$2.9 million of previously deferred Capital Costs,
respectively. In addition, Merck contract manufacturing revenue
for 2002 includes a non-recurring $1.0 million payment
received in August 2002 related to services the Company provided
in prior years.

12.     Incentive and
Stock Purchase Plans

a.     Long-Term
Incentive Plans

During 2000, the Company established the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“2000 Incentive Plan”) which, as amended, provides
for the issuance of up to 11,000,000 shares of Common Stock in
respect of awards. In addition, shares of Common Stock
previously approved by shareholders for issuance under the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“1990 Incentive Plan”) that are not issued under the
1990 Incentive Plan, may be issued as awards under the 2000
Incentive Plan. Employees of the Company, including officers,
and nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members
of the Board of Directors, (collectively,
“Participants”) may receive awards as determined by a
committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The
awards that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include:
(a) Incentive Stock Options (“ISOs”) and
Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
(c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and
(e) Other Awards.

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right
to purchase shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the
Committee; however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise
price will not be less than the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest
over a period of time determined by the Committee, generally on
a pro rata basis over a three to five year period. The Committee
also determines the expiration date of each Option; however, no
ISO is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares
of restricted Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase
such shares at a price determined by the Committee. Such shares
are nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee
(“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as
defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the
Restricted Stock, which has not vested, will be transferred to
the Company, except under defined circumstances with Committee
approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the
Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company
requires a return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the
right to require a return of all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the
right to receive, within 30 days of the date on which the
share vests, an amount, in cash and/or shares of the
Company’s Common Stock as determined by the Committee,
equal to the sum of the fair market value of a share of Common
Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests and the
aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to a share
of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of the
share of Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests.
Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock
which are granted at the discretion of the Committee.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are
valued based on the Company’s Common Stock. Subject to the
provisions of the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions
of such Other Awards are determined solely on the authority of
the Committee.

During 1990, the Company established the 1990
Incentive Plan which, as amended, provided for a maximum of
6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of awards. Employees
of the Company, including officers, and nonemployees, including
consultants and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors,
received awards as determined by a committee of independent
directors. Under the provisions of the 1990 Incentive Plan,
there will be no future awards from the plan. Awards under the
1990 Incentive Plan consisted of Incentive Stock Options and
Nonqualified Stock Options which generally vest on a pro rata
basis over a three or five year period and have a term of ten
years.

The 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans contain
provisions that allow for the Committee to provide for the
immediate vesting of awards upon a change in control of the
Company, as defined.

The Company may incur charges to operations in
connection with awards from these Incentive Plans. In accordance
with APB No. 25 and related interpretations, the Company
will record compensation expense from employee stock-based
awards under certain conditions. Generally, when the terms of
the award and the amount the employee must pay to acquire the
stock are fixed, compensation expense for options, restricted
stock, and stock bonus awards will total the grant date
intrinsic value, if any, amortized over the vesting period. For
other awards, including phantom stock, compensation expense will
be recognized over the life of the award based on the cash
remitted to settle the award or the intrinsic value of the award
on the date of exercise.

Transactions involving stock option awards during
2002, 2001, and 2000, under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans,
are summarized in the table below. Option exercise prices were
equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common
Stock on the date of grant. The total number of options
exercisable at December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was
4,670,695, 3,374,169, and 2,533,662, respectively, with weighted
average exercise prices of $15.80, $11.99, and $8.31,
respectively.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

The following table summarizes stock option
information as of December 31, 2002:

The effect on the Company’s net loss and net
loss per share had compensation costs for the Incentive Plans
been determined in accordance with the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based compensation as prescribed by
SFAS No. 123 is shown in Note 2. For the purpose
of the pro forma calculation, the fair value of each option
granted from the Incentive Plans during 2002, 2001, and 2000 was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of the
options granted during 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $14.10, $21.22,
and $26.44, respectively. The following table summarizes the
assumptions used in computing the fair value of option grants.

During 2002, 2001, and 2000, 139,611, 80,535, and
34,785 shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock were awarded
under the 2000 Incentive Plan. These shares are nontransferable
with such restriction lapsing with respect to 25% of the shares
every six months over a two-year period beginning in January
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. In accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, the Company recorded unearned
compensation within Stockholders’ Equity of
$2.7 million, $2.3 million, and $1.3 million in
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, related to these awards.
This amount was based on the fair market value of shares of the
Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and will be
expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the two year period that the
restriction on these shares lapses. During 2002 and 2001, 2,183
and 1,413 shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock were
forfeited due to employee terminations. The Company reduced
unearned compensation within Stockholders’ Equity by
$0.1 million in both 2002 and 2001 related to these
forfeited awards.

The Company recognized compensation expense from
stock-based awards of $1.8 and $0.7 million in 2002 and
2001, respectively. No stock-based compensation expense was
recognized during 2000.

F-25


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

As of December 31, 2002, there were
4,018,590 shares available for future grants under the 2000
Incentive Plan.

b.     Executive
Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock
Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) under which
1,027,500 shares of Class A Stock were reserved for
restricted stock awards. The Plan provides for the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors to award employees,
directors, consultants, and other individuals (“Plan
participants”) who render service to the Company the right
to purchase Class A Stock at a price set by the
compensation committee. The Plan provides for the vesting of
shares as determined by the compensation committee and, should
the Company’s relationship with a Plan participant
terminate before all shares are vested, unvested shares will be
repurchased by the Company at a price per share equal to the
original amount paid by the Plan participant. During 1989 and
1990, a total of 983,254 shares were issued, all of which
vested as of December 31, 1999. As of December 31,
2002, there were 44,246 shares available for future grants
under the Plan.

13.     Employee
Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of
the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the
“Savings Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide
for employees who have met defined service requirements to
participate in the Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the
Savings Plan a percentage of their compensation to be set aside
to pay their future retirement benefits, as defined. The Savings
Plan, as amended and restated during 1998, provides for the
Company to make discretionary contributions
(“Contribution”), as defined. The Company recorded
Contribution expense of $0.8 million in 2002,
$0.8 million in 2001, and $0.5 million in 2000; such
amounts were accrued as liabilities at December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively. During the first quarter of 2003,
2002, and 2001, the Company contributed 42,543, 21,953, and
17,484 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings
Plan in satisfaction of these obligations.

14.     Income
Taxes

There is no benefit for federal or state income
taxes for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2000, since
the Company has incurred operating losses since inception and
established a valuation allowance equal to the total deferred
tax asset. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company capitalized research and development costs for tax
purposes resulting in taxable income of $7.0 million, which
was offset by net operating loss carryforwards. The effects of
the alternative minimum tax on the 2001 provision were
immaterial.

The tax effect of temporary differences, net
operating loss carry-forwards, and research and experimental tax
credit carry-forwards as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was
as follows:

F-26


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

For all years presented, the Company’s
effective income tax rate is zero. The difference between the
Company’s effective income tax rate and the Federal
statutory rate of 34% is attributable to state tax benefits and
tax credit carry-forwards offset by an increase in the deferred
tax valuation allowance.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had
available for tax purposes unused net operating loss
carry-forwards of $315.5 million which will expire in
various years from 2006 to 2022. The Company’s research and
experimental tax credit carry-forwards expire in various years
from 2004 to 2022. Future changes in the ownership of the
Company could limit the future utilization of these net
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards, as defined by the
Federal and state tax codes.

15.     Legal
Matters

The Company, from time to time, has been subject
to legal claims arising in connection with its business. While
the ultimate results of the legal claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, at December 31, 2002 there were no asserted
claims against the Company which, in the opinion of management,
if adversely decided would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.

16.     Net Loss Per
Share

The Company’s basic net loss per share
amounts have been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding. In
2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company reported net losses and,
therefore, no common stock equivalents were included in the
computation of diluted net loss per share since such inclusion
would have been antidilutive. The calculations of basic and
diluted net loss per share are as follows:

Shares issuable upon the exercise of options and
warrants, vesting of restricted stock awards, and conversion of
convertible debt, which have been excluded from the diluted per
share amounts because their effect would have been antidilutive,
include the following:

18.     Unaudited
Quarterly Results

Summarized quarterly financial data for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are displayed in the
following tables.

19.     Subsequent
Event

In March 2003, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement (the “Novartis Agreement”)
with Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) to develop
and commercialize the Interleukin-1 Cytokine Trap (“IL-1
Trap”). In connection with this agreement, the Company
received an up-front payment of $27.0 million for future
development activities in the United States in support of the
IL-1 Trap. Novartis also purchased $48.0 million of newly
issued shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The exact
number of shares will be determined based upon the average
closing price of the Common Stock for the 20 consecutive
trading days ending May 9, 2003.

Development expenses incurred during 2003 (the
“2003 Expenses”) will be shared equally by the Company
and Novartis. Regeneron’s share of the 2003 Expenses will
be funded through a loan from Novartis. The loan and accrued
interest thereon will be forgiven should certain defined
pre-clinical and clinical milestones be reached, otherwise, such
amounts are payable on July 1, 2004. Development expenses
incurred subsequent to 2003 will be shared by the Company and
Novartis, as set forth in the Novartis Agreement, with funding
for Regeneron’s share of these expenses provided through an
additional loan from Novartis which, including accrued interest
thereon, is repayable in full as set forth in the agreement. The
Novartis Agreement contains a provision that allows Novartis the
right to terminate the agreement with specified advance notice.

Under the Novartis Agreement, the Company and
Novartis will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if
any, of the IL-1 Trap. In addition, the Company may receive
up to $275.0 million in milestone payments upon the receipt
of specified regulatory approvals and achieving certain product
revenues targets. Also, under the Novartis Agreement, the
Company and Novartis each have the option to collaborate on the
development and commercialization of additional defined IL-1
product candidates that Regeneron and Novartis are currently
developing independently.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2002

(Information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2002 is unaudited)

1.     Summary of
significant accounting policies

Business and organization

Amgen-Regeneron Partners (the Partnership), a
general partnership, was formed on June 21, 1991, under the
laws of the state of Delaware between Amgen Inc. (Amgen) and
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron). The Partnership was
formed to develop and commercialize in the United States
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Neurotrophin-3
(NT-3, together with BDNF, the Products) for human
pharmaceutical use, in conformity with a collaboration agreement
(the Collaboration Agreement) (Note 3).

The Partnership has conducted clinical trials of
the Products in the past. Following a review of available
clinical trial data, the Partnership discontinued the
development of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) in January 2001. Currently, there are no
ongoing development activities for NT-3.

Cash equivalents

The Partnership considers only those investments
which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and which
mature within three months of the date of purchase as cash
equivalents. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, cash and cash
equivalents consisted of a single interest bearing money market
account.

Research and development

Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. Clinical trial costs, which are a component of
research and development costs, are recognized based upon the
estimated levels of effort expended on those trials.

Income taxes

The Partnership’s financial statements do
not include a provision (credit) for income taxes. Income taxes,
if any, are the liability of the individual partners.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

2.

Capital contributions, allocation of profits
    and losses and cash distributions

Capital contributions are recorded in the capital
account of each partner. Capital account contributions are
generally made quarterly in advance based upon capital calls
made by the Partnership’s Joint Management Committee
pursuant to projected cash requirements of the Partnership.
There were no capital contributions made to the Partnership in
2002. Cash distributions, if any, and profits or losses are
allocated to each partner’s capital account in proportion
to their respective capital account contributions.

3.     Collaboration
Agreement

In August 1990, Amgen and Regeneron entered into
the Collaboration Agreement to develop and commercialize BDNF
and NT-3, compounds for which Regeneron possesses substantial
scientific, technical and proprietary information. Each party
agreed to perform research and development on the Products under
product development programs approved by the Committee. Upon
Amgen’s notification in writing to Regeneron that the
preparation of an Investigational New Drug Application for each
Product was to

F-35


AMGEN-REGENERON PARTNERS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

commence, the licenses granted by the partners to
the Partnership for the underlying technologies, discussed
below, became effective on a Product-by-Product basis. Also,
upon such notification, further research and development of the
Products under the licenses became the obligation of the
Partnership. These licenses grant the Partnership an exclusive
royalty-free right to develop, make, have made, use, sell and
distribute each Product for human pharmaceutical use in the
United States. The Partnership has, in turn, granted to Amgen
and Regeneron exclusive royalty-free sublicenses for the
underlying technologies to the extent necessary to fulfill their
obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. These sublicenses
became effective at the same time the related licenses granted
the Partnership became effective.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Amgen would be
primarily responsible for the manufacture and commercialization
of the Products in the United States if successfully developed
by the Partnership. Amgen’s costs in connection with such
activities would be reimbursed at agreed-to rates. Unless
terminated earlier, the Partnership will continue in effect,
with respect to each Product, until the later of the expiration
of the last United States patent of each Product, or
15 years from the date on which each Product was approved
for sale in the United States.

A Joint Management Committee (the Committee) is
responsible for the overall management of the business and
affairs of the Partnership as well as activities performed under
the Collaboration Agreement. Each partner has appointed three
representatives to the Committee. One additional representative
may be appointed by a partner if the balance of their capital
account becomes more than twice the amount of the balance of the
