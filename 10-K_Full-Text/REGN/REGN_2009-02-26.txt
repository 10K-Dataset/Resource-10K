PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties relating to future events and the future financial
performance of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and actual events or results may
differ materially. These statements concern, among other things, the possible
success and therapeutic applications of our product candidates and research
programs, the commercial success of our marketed product, the timing and nature
of the clinical and research programs now underway or planned, and the future
sources and uses of capital and our financial needs. These statements are made
by us based on management’s current beliefs and judgment. In evaluating such
statements, stockholders and potential investors should specifically consider
the various factors identified under the caption “Risk Factors” which could
cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such
forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update
publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

General

Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops,
and commercializes pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical
conditions. We currently have one marketed product: ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) Injection for Subcutaneous Use, which is now available for
prescription in the United States for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated
Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome
(FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) in adults and children 12 and older. We
also have six clinical development programs, including three late-stage clinical
programs. Our late stage programs are aflibercept (VEGF Trap), which is being
developed in oncology in collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group, VEGF
Trap-Eye, which is being developed in eye diseases using intraocular delivery in
collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC, and ARCALYST which is being developed
for the treatment of gout. Our earlier stage clinical programs are REGN88, an
antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), which is being developed in
rheumatoid arthritis, REGN421, an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4 (Dll4), which
is being developed in oncology, and REGN475, an antibody to Nerve Growth Factor
(NGF), which is being developed for the treatment of pain. All three of these
antibodies are being developed in collaboration with sanofi-aventis.

We expect
that our next generation of product candidates will be based on our proprietary
technologies for developing human monoclonal antibodies. Our antibody program is
being conducted primarily in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our preclinical
research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis, ophthalmology,
metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases and disorders, inflammation and
immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular
diseases.

Our core
business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in basic scientific
research and discovery-enabling technology and combine that foundation with our
manufacturing and clinical development capabilities to build a successful,
integrated biopharmaceutical company. However, developing and commercializing
new medicines entails significant risk and expense.

We
believe that our ability to develop product candidates is enhanced by the
application of our

VelociSuite

™ technology platforms. Our discovery
platforms are designed to identify specific genes of therapeutic interest for a
particular disease or cell type and validate targets through high-throughput
production of mammalian models. Our human monoclonal antibody technology
(

VelocImmune

®

) and cell line expression technologies may then
be utilized to design and produce new product candidates directed against the
disease target. Our first three antibody product candidates currently in
clinical trials were developed using

VelocImmune

. Over the course of the
next several years, we plan to advance an average of two to three new antibody
product candidates into clinical development each year. We continue to invest in
the development of enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to identify,
develop, and commercialize new product candidates.


Commercial
Product:

ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)
– Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS)

In
February 2008, we received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) Injection for
Subcutaneous Use for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes
(CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and
Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) in adults and children 12 and older. We shipped
$10.7 million of ARCALYST to our distributors in 2008. ARCALYST is a
protein-based product designed to bind the interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine
and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors. ARCALYST is the only
therapy approved in the United States for patients with CAPS, a group of rare,
inherited, auto-inflammatory conditions characterized by life-long, recurrent
symptoms of rash, fever/chills, joint pain, eye redness/pain, and fatigue.
Intermittent, disruptive exacerbations or flares can be triggered at any time by
exposure to cooling temperatures, stress, exercise, or other unknown stimuli.
CAPS is caused by a range of mutations in the gene NLRP3 (formerly known as

CIAS1

) which encodes a protein named cryopyrin. In addition to FCAS and
MWS, CAPS includes Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID).
ARCALYST has not been studied for the treatment of NOMID.

In March
2008, ARCALYST became available for prescription in the United States and we
transitioned the patients who participated in the CAPS pivotal study from
clinical study drug to commercial supplies. In 2009, we expect to ship $20-24
million of ARCALYST to our U.S. distributors. In July 2008, we submitted a
Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency
(EMEA) for ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS in the European Union.

Clinical
Programs:

1. Aflibercept (VEGF Trap) –
Oncology

Aflibercept is a protein-based product candidate designed to bind all
forms of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (called VEGF-A, also known as
Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF) and the related Placental Growth Factor
(called PlGF), and prevent their interaction with cell surface receptors. VEGF-A
(and to a less validated degree, PlGF) is required for the growth of new blood
vessels (a process known as angiogenesis) that are needed for tumors to grow and
is a potent regulator of vascular permeability and leakage.

Aflibercept is being developed globally in cancer indications in
collaboration with sanofi-aventis. We and sanofi-aventis are enrolling patients
in four Phase 3 trials that combine aflibercept with standard chemotherapy
regimens for the treatment of cancer. One trial is evaluating aflibercept as a

nd

line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (the VELOUR
study) in combination with FOLFIRI (folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil,
and irinotecan). A second trial is evaluating aflibercept as a 1

st

line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine
(the VANILLA study). A third trial is evaluating aflibercept as a 1

st

line treatment for metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer in
combination with docetaxel/prednisone (the VENICE study). The fourth trial is
evaluating aflibercept as a 2

nd

line treatment for metastatic
non-small cell lung cancer in combination with docetaxel (the VITAL study). All
four trials are studying the current standard of chemotherapy care for the
cancer being studied with and without aflibercept. As of February 2009, each of
the four Phase 3 trials was over one-third enrolled, and initial data from the
Phase 3 program is expected in 2010. In addition, a Phase 2 study of aflibercept
in 1

st

-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with folinic
acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (the AFFIRM study) began
recruiting patients in January 2009.

Aflibercept is also being studied in a Phase 2 single-agent study in
advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) patients with symptomatic malignant ascites (SMA).
This trial is now fully enrolled and we expect to have initial data from this
trial by mid-2009. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to aflibercept for
the treatment of SMA.

In
addition, multiple exploratory studies are being conducted in conjunction with
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)
evaluating aflibercept as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy
regimens in a variety of cancer indications.


Aflibercept Collaboration with the
sanofi-aventis Group

In
September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Aventis
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (predecessor to sanofi-aventis U.S.) to collaborate on the
development and commercialization of aflibercept in all countries other than
Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize
aflibercept. In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration
agreement to exclude, from the scope of the collaboration, the development and
commercialization of aflibercept for intraocular delivery to the eye. In
December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to
expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development
of aflibercept to include Japan. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended,
we and sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if
any, of aflibercept outside of Japan for disease indications included in our
collaboration. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty of approximately 35% on
annual sales of aflibercept, subject to certain potential adjustments. We may
also receive up to $400 million in milestone payments upon receipt of specified
marketing approvals, including up to $360 million in milestone payments related
to receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight aflibercept oncology and other
indications in the United States or the European Union and up to $40 million
related to receipt of marketing approvals for up to five oncology indications in
Japan.

Under the
aflibercept collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement
will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we
will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of aflibercept development
expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a
faster rate at our option.

2. VEGF Trap-Eye – Ophthalmologic
Diseases

VEGF
Trap-Eye is a specially purified and formulated form of VEGF Trap for use in
intraocular applications. We and Bayer HealthCare are testing VEGF Trap-Eye in a
Phase 3 program in patients with the neovascular form of age-related macular
degeneration (wet AMD). We and Bayer HealthCare also initiated a Phase 2 study
of VEGF Trap-Eye in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) in late 2008. Wet
AMD and diabetic retinopathy (which includes DME) are two of the leading causes
of adult blindness in the developed world. In both conditions, severe visual
loss is caused by a combination of retinal edema and neovascular
proliferation.

The Phase
3 trials in wet AMD, known as VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 (

V

EGF Trap:

I

nvestigation of

E

fficacy and Safety in

W

et age-related
macular degeneration), are comparing VEGF Trap-Eye and ranibizumab
(Lucentis

®

, a registered trademark of Genentech, Inc.), an
anti-angiogenic agent approved for use in wet AMD. VIEW 1 is being conducted in
North America and VIEW 2 is being conducted in Europe, Asia Pacific, Japan, and
Latin America. The VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 trials are both evaluating dosing intervals
of four and eight weeks for VEGF Trap-Eye compared with ranibizumab dosed
according to its U.S. label every four weeks over the first year. As needed
dosing (PRN) with both agents will be evaluated in the second year of the
studies. We and Bayer Healthcare expect to complete enrollment of the VIEW 1 and
VIEW 2 trials in 2009 and initial data are expected in late 2010.

In August
2008, we and Bayer HealthCare AG announced the preliminary results of a Phase 2
study in wet AMD which demonstrated that patients treated with VEGF Trap-Eye
achieved durable improvements in visual acuity and retinal thickness for up to
one year. In September 2008, the complete results of this study, including
additional data on reductions in the size of the active choroidal
neovascularization membrane (CNV), the active lesion that is the underlying
cause of vision loss in patients with wet AMD, were reported at the 2008 annual
meeting of the Retina Society.

In this
double-masked Phase 2 trial, patients were initially treated with either fixed
monthly or quarterly dosing for 12 weeks and then continued to receive treatment
for another 40 weeks on a PRN dosing schedule. Patients receiving monthly doses
of VEGF Trap-Eye of either 2.0 or 0.5 milligrams (mg) for 12 weeks followed by
PRN dosing achieved mean improvements in visual acuity versus baseline of 9.0
letters (p<0.0001 versus baseline) and 5.4 letters (p<0.085 versus
baseline), respectively, at the end of one year. The proportion of patients with
vision of 20/40 or better (part of the legal minimum requirement for an
unrestricted driver’s license in the U.S.) increased from 23% at baseline to 45%
at week 52 in patients initially treated with 2.0 mg monthly and from 16% at
baseline to 47% at week 52 in patients initially treated with 0.5 mg monthly.
Patients receiving monthly doses of VEGF Trap-Eye of either 2.0 or 0.5 mg also
achieved mean decreases in retinal thickness versus baseline of 143 microns
(p<0.0001 versus baseline) and 125 microns (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at
week 52, respectively.


During
the week 12 to week 52 PRN dosing period, patients initially dosed on a 2.0 mg
monthly schedule received, on average, only 1.6 additional injections and those
initially dosed on a 0.5 mg monthly schedule received, on average, 2.5
additional injections.

While PRN dosing following a fixed
quarterly dosing regimen (with dosing at baseline and week 12) also yielded
improvements in visual acuity and retinal thickness versus baseline at week 52,
the results generally were not as robust as those obtained with initial fixed
monthly dosing.

In this
Phase 2 study, treatment with VEGF Trap-Eye was also associated with a reduction
in the size of the CNV lesion. Patients initially receiving either a 2.0 mg or
0.5 mg monthly fixed dose of VEGF Trap-Eye for 12 weeks followed by PRN dosing
experienced statistically significant 3.41 mm


and 1.42
mm


reductions in mean CNV size at 48 weeks (the final one-year
analysis endpoint from the independent reading center) versus baseline,
respectively. Patients in the 2.0 mg monthly cohort also achieved a
statistically significant 1.75 mm


reduction in total lesion size. A
reduction in total lesion size was not seen in the cohort initially dosed with
0.5 mg monthly.

In this Phase 2 study, VEGF Trap-Eye
was generally well tolerated and there were no reported drug-related serious
adverse events. There was one reported case of culture-negative
endophthalmitis/uveitis in the study eye, which was deemed not to be
drug-related. The most commonly reported adverse events were those typically
associated with intravitreal injections.

The
recently initiated Phase 2 DME study, known as the DA VINCI study, is a
double-masked, randomized, controlled trial that is evaluating four different
VEGF Trap-Eye regimens versus laser treatment. The study will be enrolling
approximately 200 patients in the U.S., Canada, European Union, and Australia.
The patients in the study will be treated for 52 weeks followed by six
additional months of safety evaluation. The primary efficacy endpoint is the
change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to week
24.

Collaboration with Bayer
HealthCare

In
October 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare
for the global development and commercialization outside the United States of
VEGF Trap-Eye. Under the agreement, we and Bayer HealthCare will collaborate on,
and share the costs of, the development of VEGF Trap-Eye through an integrated
global plan that encompasses wet AMD, DME, and other diseases and disorders.
Bayer HealthCare will market VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States, where the
companies will share equally in profits from any future sales of VEGF Trap-Eye.
If VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing authorization in a major market country
outside the United States, we will be obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare
for 50% of the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from
our share of the collaboration profits. Within the United States, we retain
exclusive commercialization rights to VEGF Trap-Eye and are entitled to all
profits from any such sales. We received an up-front payment of $75.0 million
from Bayer HealthCare. In 2007, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment
from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 study
of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD, and can earn up to $90 million in additional
development and regulatory milestones related to the development of VEGF
Trap-Eye and marketing approvals in major market countries outside the United
States. We can also earn up to $135 million in sales milestones if total annual
sales of VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States achieve certain specified
levels starting at $200 million.

3. ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) – Inflammatory Diseases

We are
evaluating ARCALYST in certain diseases and disorders, in addition to CAPS,
where IL-1 may play an important role. In September 2008, we announced the
results of a Phase 2 study which evaluated the efficacy and safety of ARCALYST
versus placebo in the prevention of gout flares induced by the initiation of
urate-lowering drug therapy that is used to control gout. In this 83-patient,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the mean number of flares per patient
over the first 12 weeks of urate-lowering therapy was 0.79 with placebo and 0.15
with ARCALYST (p=0.0011), an 81% reduction. This was the primary endpoint of the
study. All secondary endpoints also were met with statistical significance. In
the first 12 weeks of treatment, 45.2% of patients treated with placebo
experienced a gout flare and, of those, 47.4% had more than one flare. Among
patients treated with ARCALYST, only 14.6% experienced a gout flare (p=0.0037
versus placebo) and none had more than one flare. Injection-site reaction was
the most commonly reported adverse event with ARCALYST and no serious
drug-related adverse events were reported.


Gout is
characterized by high blood levels of uric acid, a bodily waste product normally
excreted by the kidneys. The uric acid can form crystals in the joints of the
toes, ankles, knees, wrists, fingers, and elbows. Chronic treatment with uric
acid-lowering medicines, such as allopurinol, is prescribed to eliminate the
uric acid crystals and prevent reformation. During the first months of
allopurinol therapy, while uric acid blood levels are being reduced, the break
up of the uric acid crystals can result in stimulation of inflammatory
mediators, including IL-1, resulting in acute flares of joint pain and
inflammation. These painful flares generally persist for at least five
days.

We are in
the process of initiating a Phase 3 clinical development program with
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) for the treatment of gout. Two Phase 3
clinical trials will evaluate ARCALYST versus placebo for the prevention of gout
flares in patients initiating urate-lowering drug therapy. We plan to initiate a
Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST for acute gout that will evaluate treatment
with ARCALYST alone versus ARCALYST in combination with a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) versus an NSAID alone. The Phase 3 clinical
development program will also include a separate safety study.

Under a
March 2003 collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, we retain the right
to elect to collaborate in the future development and commercialization of a
Novartis IL-1 antibody which is in clinical development. Following completion of
Phase 2 development and submission to us of a written report on the Novartis
IL-1 antibody, we have the right, in consideration for an opt-in payment, to
elect to co-develop and co-commercialize the Novartis IL-1 antibody in North
America. If we elect to exercise this right, we are responsible for paying 45%
of post-election North American development costs for the antibody product. In
return, we are entitled to co-promote the Novartis IL-1 antibody, and to receive
45% of net profits on sales of the antibody product, in North America. Under
certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive royalties on sales of the
Novartis IL-1 antibody in Europe. Under the collaboration agreement, Novartis
has the right to elect to collaborate in the development and commercialization
of a second generation IL-1 Trap following completion of its Phase 2
development, should we decide to clinically develop such a second generation
product candidate. Novartis does not have any rights or options with respect to
ARCALYST.

4. Monoclonal
Antibodies

We and
sanofi-aventis are collaborating on the discovery, development, and
commercialization of fully human monoclonal antibodies generated using our

VelocImmune

®

technology. The first therapeutic antibodies to
enter clinical development under the collaboration are REGN88, an antibody to
the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that is being evaluated in rheumatoid
arthritis, and REGN475, an antibody to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) that is being
developed for the treatment of pain. In addition, a Phase I trial is in the
process of being initiated for REGN421, an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4
(Dll4) that is being evaluated in oncology in patients with advanced
malignancies. Over the course of the next several years, we and sanofi-aventis
plan to advance an average of two to three new antibodies into clinical
development each year.

Research and Development
Technologies:

One way
that a cell communicates with other cells is by releasing specific signaling
proteins, either locally or into the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct
functions, and are classified into different “families” of molecules, such as
peptide hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. All of these secreted (or
signaling) proteins travel to and are recognized by another set of proteins,
called “receptors,” which reside on the surface of responding cells. These
secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and biological processes,
causing diverse effects ranging from the regulation of growth of particular cell
types, to inflammation mediated by white blood cells. Secreted proteins can at
times be overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases. In these disease
settings, blocking the action of secreted proteins can have clinical benefit.

Regeneron
scientists have developed two different technologies to design protein
therapeutics to block the action of specific secreted proteins. The first
technology, termed the “Trap” technology, was used to generate our first
approved product, ARCALYST, as well as aflibercept, and VEGF Trap-Eye which are
in Phase 3 clinical trials. These novel “Traps” are composed of fusions between
two distinct receptor components and the constant region of an antibody molecule
called the “Fc region”, resulting in high affinity product candidates.

VelociSuite

™ is our second technology platform and it is used for discovering,
developing, and producing fully human monoclonal antibodies.


VelociSuite™

VelociSuite

consists of

VelocImmune

®

,
VelociGene

®

, VelociMouse

®

, and VelociMab™.

The

VelocImmune

mouse platform is utilized to produce fully human monoclonal
antibodies.

VelocImmune

was generated by exploiting our

VelociGene

technology (see below), in a process in which six megabases of mouse immune gene
loci were replaced, or “humanized,” with corresponding human immune gene loci.

VelocImmune

mice can be used to generate efficiently fully human
monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic interest.

VelocImmune

and
our entire

VelociSuite

offer the potential to increase the speed and
efficiency through which human monoclonal antibody therapeutics may be
discovered and validated, thereby improving the overall efficiency of our early
stage drug development activities. We are utilizing the

VelocImmune

technology to produce our next generation of drug candidates for preclinical and
clinical development.

Our

VelociGene

platform allows custom and precise manipulation of very large sequences of DNA
to produce highly customized alterations of a specified target gene and
accelerates the production of knock-out and transgenic expression models without
using either positive/negative selection or isogenic DNA. In producing knockout
models, a color or fluorescent marker is substituted in place of the actual gene
sequence, allowing for high-resolution visualization of precisely where the gene
is active in the body, during normal body functioning, as well as in disease
processes. For the optimization of pre-clinical development and toxicology
programs,

VelociGene

offers the opportunity to humanize targets by replacing the
mouse gene with the human homolog. Thus,

VelociGene

allows scientists to
rapidly identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or
over-expressing the target gene, as well as to characterize and test potential
therapeutic molecules.

The

VelociMouse

technology platform allows for the direct and immediate generation of
genetically altered mice from embryonic stem cells (ES cells), thereby avoiding
the lengthy process involved in generating and breeding knockout mice from
chimeras. Mice generated through this method are normal and healthy and exhibit
a 100% germ-line transmission. Furthermore, Regeneron’s VelociMice are suitable
for direct phenotyping or other studies. We have also developed our

VelociMab

platform for the rapid generation of expression cell lines for our Traps and our

VelocImmune

human monoclonal antibodies.

Antibody Collaboration with
sanofi-aventis

In
November 2007, we and sanofi-aventis entered into a global, strategic
collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal
antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical
Development Agreement and a License and Collaboration Agreement. We received a
non-refundable, up-front payment of $85.0 million from sanofi-aventis under the
discovery agreement. In addition, sanofi-aventis is funding research at
Regeneron to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop
fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. Sanofi-aventis funded
approximately $75 million of research from the collaboration’s inception through
December 31, 2008 and will fund up to $100 million per year in 2009 through
2012. Sanofi-aventis also has an option to extend the discovery program for up
to an additional three years for further antibody development and preclinical
activities. We will lead the design and conduct of research activities,
including target identification and validation, antibody development, research
and preclinical activities through filing of an Investigational New Drug
Application, toxicology studies, and manufacture of preclinical and clinical
supplies.

For each
drug candidate identified under the discovery agreement, sanofi-aventis has the
option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement. If it
elects to do so, sanofi-aventis will co-develop the drug candidate with us
through product approval. Development costs will be shared between the
companies, with sanofi-aventis generally funding drug candidate development
costs up front. We are generally responsible for reimbursing sanofi-aventis for
half of the total development costs for all collaboration products from our
share of profits from commercialization of collaboration products to the extent
they are sufficient for this purpose. Sanofi-aventis will lead commercialization
activities for products developed under the license agreement, subject to our
right to co-promote such products. The parties will equally share profits and
losses from sales within the United States. The parties will share profits
outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65%
(sanofi-aventis)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us), and will
share losses outside the United States at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us). In
addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to $250 million in
sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing after aggregate
annual sales outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month
basis.


In August
2008, we entered into an agreement with sanofi-aventis to use our

VelociGene

®

platform to supply sanofi-aventis with genetically
modified mammalian models of gene function and disease. Sanofi-aventis will pay
us a minimum of $21.5 million for the term of the agreement, which extends
through December 2012, for knock-out and transgenic models of gene function for
target genes identified by sanofi-aventis. Sanofi-aventis will use these models
for its internal research programs that are outside of the scope of our antibody
collaboration.

License Agreement with AstraZeneca

In
February 2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with
AstraZeneca UK Limited that allows AstraZeneca to utilize our

VelocImmune

technology in
its internal research programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under
the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca made two $20.0 million annual,
non-refundable payments to us, one in February 2007 and the other in February
2008. AstraZeneca is required to make up to four additional annual payments of
$20.0 million, subject to its ability to terminate the agreement after making
the first two additional payments or earlier if the technology does not meet
minimum performance criteria. We are entitled to receive a mid-single-digit
royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by AstraZeneca using
our

VelocImmune

technology.

License Agreement with Astellas

In March
2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Astellas Pharma
Inc. that allows Astellas to utilize our

VelocImmune

technology in its internal
research programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of
the agreement, Astellas made two $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payments
to us, one in April 2007 and the other in June 2008. Astellas is required to
make up to four additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to its
ability to terminate the agreement after making the first two additional
payments or earlier if the technology does not meet minimum performance
criteria. We are entitled to receive a mid-single-digit royalty on any future
sales of antibody products discovered by Astellas using our

VelocImmune

technology.

Academic

VelocImmune

®

Investigators Program

In
September 2008, we entered into an agreement that will provide researchers at
Columbia University Medical Center with access to our

VelocImmune

technology platform. Under the agreement, scientists at Columbia will use

VelocImmune

mice to generate antibodies against their research targets
and will conduct research to discover potential human therapeutics based on the
antibodies. We have an exclusive option to license the antibodies for
development and commercialization as therapeutic or diagnostic products and will
pay Columbia a low single-digit royalty on ensuing product sales.

National Institutes of Health
Grant

In
September 2006, we were awarded a five-year grant from the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) as part of the NIH’s Knockout Mouse Project. The goal of the
Knockout Mouse Project is to build a comprehensive and broadly available
resource of knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function and
human diseases. We are using our

VelociGene

technology to take aim at 3,500 of the most difficult genes to
target and which are not currently the focus of other large-scale knockout mouse
programs. We also agreed to grant a limited license to a consortium of research
institutions, the other major participants in the Knockout Mouse Project, to use
components of our

VelociGene

technology in the Knockout Mouse Project. We are generating a
collection of targeting vectors and targeted mouse ES cells which can be used to
produce knockout mice. These materials are available to academic researchers
without charge. We will receive a fee for each targeted ES cell line or
targeting construct made by us or the research consortium and transferred to
commercial entities.

Under the
NIH grant, as amended in September 2008, we are entitled to receive a minimum of
$24.5 million over the five-year period beginning September 2006, including $1.5
million to optimize our existing C57BL/6 ES cell line and its proprietary growth
medium, both of which are being supplied to the research consortium for its use
in the Knockout Mouse Project. We have the right to use, for any purpose, all
materials generated by us and the research consortium.


Research
Programs:

Oncology and
Angiogenesis

In many
clinical settings, positively or negatively regulating blood vessel growth could
have important therapeutic benefits, as could the repair of damaged and leaky
vessels. VEGF was the first growth factor shown to be specific for blood
vessels, by virtue of having its receptor specifically expressed on blood vessel
cells. In 1994, we discovered a second family of angiogenic growth factors,
termed Angiopoietins, and we have received patents covering members of this
family. Angiopoietins include naturally occurring positive and negative
regulators of angiogenesis, as described in numerous scientific manuscripts
published by our scientists and their collaborators. Angiopoietins are being
evaluated in preclinical research by us and our academic collaborators. Our
preclinical studies have revealed that VEGF and Angiopoietins normally function
in a coordinated and collaborative manner during blood vessel growth.
Manipulation of both VEGF and Angiopoietins seems to be of value in blocking
vessel growth. We have research programs focusing on several targets in the
areas of oncology and angiogenesis.

Tumors
depend on the growth of new blood vessels (a process called “angiogenesis”) to
support their continued growth. Therapies that block tumor angiogenesis,
specifically those that block VEGF, the key initiator of tumor angiogenesis,
recently have been validated in human cancer patients. However, anti-VEGF
approaches do not work in all patients, and many tumors can become resistant to
such therapies.

In the
December 21, 2006 issue of the journal

Nature

, we reported data from a
preclinical study demonstrating that blocking an important cell signaling
molecule, known as Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), inhibited the growth of
experimental tumors by interfering with their ability to produce a functional
blood supply. The inhibition of tumor growth was seen in a variety of tumor
types, including those that were resistant to blockade of VEGF, suggesting a
novel anti-angiogenesis therapeutic approach. We are in the process of
initiating Phase 1 clinical development of a fully human monoclonal antibody to
Dll4 that was discovered using our

VelocImmune

®

technology.

Metabolic and Related
Diseases

Food
intake and metabolism are regulated by complex interactions between diverse
neural and hormonal signals that serve to maintain an optimal balance between
energy intake, storage, and utilization. The hypothalamus, a small area at the
base of the brain, is critically involved in integrating peripheral signals
which reflect nutritional status and neural outputs which regulate appetite,
food seeking behaviors, and energy expenditure. Metabolic disorders, such as
type 2 diabetes, reflect a dysregulation in the systems which ordinarily tightly
couple energy intake to energy expenditure. Our preclinical research program in
this area encompasses the study of peripheral (hormonal) regulators of food
intake and metabolism in health and disease. We have identified several targets
in these therapeutic areas and are evaluating potential antibodies to evaluate
in preclinical studies.

Muscle Diseases and
Disorders

Muscle
atrophy occurs in many neuromuscular diseases and also when muscle is unused, as
often occurs during prolonged hospital stays and during convalescence.
Currently, physicians have few options to treat subjects with muscle atrophy or
other muscle conditions which afflict millions of people globally. Thus, a
treatment that has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle could have significant
clinical benefit. Our muscle research program is currently focused on conducting
in vivo and in vitro experiments with the objective of demonstrating and further
understanding the molecular pathways involved in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy,
and discovering therapeutic candidates that can modulate these pathways. We have
several molecules in late stage research and are evaluating them for possible
further development.

Other Therapeutic
Areas

We also
have research programs focusing on ophthalmology, inflammatory and immune
diseases, bone and cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases.


Manufacturing

Our
manufacturing facilities are located in Rensselaer, New York and consist of
three buildings totaling approximately 395,500 square feet of research,
manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. At December 31, 2008, we employed
246 people at our Rensselaer facilities. There were no impairment losses
associated with long-lived assets at these facilities as of December 31,
2008.

Among the
conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a medicine is the requirement
that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
conform to the good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations of the health
authority. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of
production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance.
Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, are also subject to
inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other national, federal,
state, and local agencies. If our manufacturing facilities fail to comply with
FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be required to suspend
manufacturing. This would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flow.

Competition

We face
substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and chemical
companies (see “Risk Factors –

Even if our
product candidates are approved for marketing, their commercial success is
highly uncertain because our competitors have received approval for products
with a similar mechanism of action, and competitors may get to the marketplace
with better or lower cost drugs.

”). Our
competitors include Genentech, Novartis, Pfizer Inc., Bayer HealthCare, Onyx
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Abbott Laboratories, sanofi-aventis, Merck & Co.,
Amgen Inc., Roche, and others. Many of our competitors have substantially
greater research, preclinical, and clinical product development and
manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than
we do. Our smaller competitors may also be significant if they acquire or
discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements, or merge with
large pharmaceutical companies. Even when we achieve product commercialization,
one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization earlier
than we do or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our
activities. Our ability to compete will depend on how fast we can develop safe
and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing and approval
processes, and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market.
Competition among product candidates approved for sale will also be based on
efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other
factors.

ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept).

There are both small molecules and antibodies in development
by third parties that are designed to block the synthesis of interleukin-1 or
inhibit the signaling of interleukin-1. For example, Eli Lilly and Company,
Novartis, and Xoma Ltd. are each developing antibodies to interleukin-1 and
Amgen is developing an antibody to the interleukin-1 receptor. Novartis has
filed applications in the U.S. and Europe seeking regulatory approval of its
IL-1 antibody in CAPS. Novartis is also developing its IL-1 antibody in gout and
other inflammatory diseases. These drug candidates could offer competitive
advantages over ARCALYST. The successful development of these competing
molecules could delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
commercialize ARCALYST.

Aflibercept and VEGF
Trap-Eye.

Many companies are developing
therapeutic molecules designed to block the actions of VEGF specifically and
angiogenesis in general. A variety of approaches have been employed, including
antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF receptor, small molecule antagonists
to the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, and other anti-angiogenesis strategies.
Many of these alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to our
VEGF Trap in efficacy, side-effect profile, or method of delivery. Additionally,
some of these molecules are either already approved for marketing or are at a
more advanced stage of development than our product candidate.

In
particular, Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
Avastin

®

, on the market for treating
certain cancers and a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are
working to develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, Pfizer, and
Imclone Systems Incorporated (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly). Many
of these molecules are further along in development than aflibercept and may
offer competitive advantages over our molecule. Pfizer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals
(together with its partner Bayer) are selling and marketing oral medications
that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the
growth of tumors.


The
market for eye disease products is also very competitive. Novartis and Genentech
are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF
antibody fragment (Lucentis

®

) for the
treatment of wet AMD, DME, and other eye indications. Lucentis was approved by
the FDA in June 2006 for the treatment of wet AMD. Many other companies are
working on the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of
wet AMD and DME that act by blocking VEGF, VEGF receptors, and through the use
of small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene expression.
In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label a third-party reformulated
version of Genentech’s approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

, with success for the treatment of wet AMD. The relatively
low cost of therapy with Avastin (Genentech) in patients with wet AMD presents a
significant competitive challenge in this indication. The National Eye Institute
initiated a Phase 3 trial to compare Lucentis to Avastin in the treatment of wet
AMD. Avastin (Genentech) is also being evaluated in eye diseases in trials that
have been initiated in the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany,
Israel, and other areas.

REGN88.

We are developing REGN88 for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis as part of our global, strategic collaboration with sanofi-aventis to
discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. The
availability of highly effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists such as
Enbrel

®

(Immunex Corporation),
Remicade

®

(Centocor, Inc.), and
Humira

®

(Abbott), and other marketed
therapies makes it difficult to successfully develop and commercialize REGN88.
REGN88 is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor.
Roche is developing Actemra

TM

(tocilizumab) an antibody against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor.
Roche’s antibody is approved for marketing and sale in Europe and is the subject
of a filed Biologics License Application with the FDA for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis. Roche’s IL-6 receptor antibody, other clinical candidates
in development, and the drugs on the market to treat rheumatoid arthritis could
offer competitive advantages over REGN88. This could delay or impair our ability
to successfully develop and commercialize REGN88.

REGN421.

We are also developing REGN421 for the treatment of various
cancers as part of our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Many
companies are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block angiogenesis. A
variety of different approaches have been employed, including developing a
number of antagonists to VEGF and Dll4 and other anti-angiogenesis strategies.
Many of these alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to REGN421
in efficacy, side-effect profile, or method of delivery. Additionally, some of
these molecules are either already approved for marketing or are at a more
advanced stage of development than our product candidate. In particular, OncoMed
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has a Dll4 antibody in Phase 1 clinical development.

REGN475.

We are also developing REGN475 for the treatment of pain as
part of our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. The availability of
effective FDA approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including
NSAIDs available over-the-counter without a prescription, and other marketed
therapies, may make it difficult to successfully develop and commercialize
REGN475. REGN475 is a human monoclonal antibody targeting Nerve Growth Factor
(NGF). Pfizer is also developing an antibody against NGF that is in Phase 3
clinical trials for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis. Pfizer’s NGF
antibody, other clinical candidates in development, and other drugs on the
market, including over-the-counter medications, to treat pain could offer
competitive advantages over REGN475, which could delay or impair our ability to
successfully develop and commercialize REGN475.

Other Areas.

Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting
to discover new therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time
and resources. In these and related areas, intellectual property rights have
been sought and certain rights have been granted to competitors and potential
competitors of ours, and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in
such areas as a result of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained
personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic competitors are
involved in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that are the
focus of other research or development programs we are now conducting. These
competitors include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many others. Many firms and
entities are engaged in research and development in the areas of cytokines,
interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle conditions. Some of these competitors are
currently conducting advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in
these areas. These and other competitors may have established substantial
intellectual property and other competitive advantages.

If a
competitor announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be
competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing
approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product, the announcement may
have an adverse effect on our operations or future prospects or on the market
price of our Common Stock.


We also
compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public or
private research organizations, which conduct research, seek patent protection,
and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of
products that would provide royalties or other consideration for use of their
technology. These institutions are becoming more active in seeking patent
protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties or other
consideration for use of the technology they have developed. Products developed
in this manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also compete
with others in acquiring technology from these institutions, agencies, and
organizations.

Patents, Trademarks, and Trade
Secrets

Our
success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade
secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of
third parties (see “Risk Factors –

We may be
restricted in our development and/or commercialization activities by, and could
be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed, third party
patents or other proprietary rights

.”). Our
policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and
improvements that we consider important to our business and operations. We are
the nonexclusive licensee of a number of additional U.S. patents and patent
applications. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing
technological innovation in an effort to develop and maintain our competitive
position. We or our licensors or collaborators have filed patent applications on
various products and processes relating to our product candidates as well as
other technologies and inventions in the United States and in certain foreign
countries. We intend to file additional patent applications, when appropriate,
relating to improvements in these technologies and other specific products and
processes. We plan to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents
and other proprietary technology.

Patent
law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in the biotechnology field
is evolving and our patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty.
Others may independently develop similar products or processes to those
developed by us, duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are
issued to us, design around any products and processes covered by our patents.
We expect to continue, when appropriate, to file product and process patent
applications with respect to our inventions. However, we may not file any such
applications or, if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or
licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of
others.

Defense
and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time
consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that patents
issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find
that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may
have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing
fees to take into account patent rights of third parties.

Government Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign
countries is a significant factor in the research, development, manufacture, and
marketing of ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)
and our product candidates (see “Risk Factors –

If we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we
will not be able to market or sell them.

”

)

. All of
our product candidates will require regulatory approval before they can be
commercialized. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to
rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-market approval
requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of the structure
and substance of the FDA and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have
been reformed during recent years, and continued reform is under consideration
in a number of jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome and impact of such reforms
and potential reforms cannot be predicted.

The
activities required before a product candidate may be marketed in the United
States begin with preclinical tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory
evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of
the product candidate and its formulations. The results of these studies must be
submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, which
must be reviewed by the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin.
Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In Phase 1, trials
are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety
profile of the product candidate. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with
subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to
evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of different
potential doses of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical
trials are


conducted with patients afflicted with
the specific disease or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as required by the
FDA. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product
candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License
Application, or BLA, for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate
may be approved for commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant
marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the
application.

Any
approval required by the FDA for any of our product candidates may not be
obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The designation of a clinical trial as
being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will
be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and a clinical
trial may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the
designation of the trial as being of a particular phase. The results of
preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials may not predict long-term
safety or efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in
humans.

Approval
of a product candidate by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries
is generally required prior to commencement of marketing of the product in those
countries. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve
additional testing, and the time required to obtain such approval may differ
from that required for FDA approval.

Various
federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence
the research, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing,
transport, and other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates. The lengthy
process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable statutes
and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by
us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining,
regulatory approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of
our products and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue.

In
addition to the foregoing, our present and future business will be subject to
regulation under the United States Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the
Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances
Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions,
and other current and potential future local, state, federal, and foreign
regulations.

Business Segments

We manage
our business as one segment which includes all activities related to the
discovery of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical
conditions and the development and commercialization of these discoveries. This
segment also includes revenues and expenses related to (i) research and
development activities conducted under our collaboration agreements with third
parties and our grant from the NIH, (ii) ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)
product sales for the treatment of CAPS, and (iii) the supply of specified,
ordered research materials using Regeneron-developed proprietary technology.
Prior to 2007, our operations were managed in two business segments: research
and development, and contract manufacturing. In 2006, the contract manufacturing
segment included all revenues and expenses related to the commercial production
of a product under a contract with Merck, which expired in October 2006. For
financial information about these segments, see Note 21, “Segment Information”,
beginning on page F-33 in our Financial Statements.

Employees

As of
December 31, 2008, we had 919 full-time employees, of whom 185 held a Ph.D.
and/or M.D., or PharmD degree. We believe that we have been successful in
attracting skilled and experienced personnel in a highly competitive
environment; however, competition for these personnel is intense. None of our
personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and our management
considers its relations with our employees to be good.

Available Information

We make
available free of charge on or through our Internet website

http://www.regeneron.com

our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current
Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or
furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or
furnish it to, the SEC.


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

We
operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and
uncertainties. We caution you to read the following risk factors, which have
affected, and/or in the future could affect, our business, operating results,
financial condition, and cash flows. The risks described below include
forward-looking statements, and actual events and our actual results may differ
substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Furthermore,
additional risks and uncertainties are described under other captions in this
report and should be considered by our investors.

Risks Related to Our Financial
Results and Need for Additional Financing

We
have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve profitability.
If we continue to incur operating losses, we may be unable to continue our
operations.

From
inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31, 2008, we had a cumulative loss
of $875.9 million. If we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a
profitable company, we may be unable to continue our operations. In the absence
of substantial revenue from the sale of products or other sources, the amount,
timing, nature or source of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue
as we conduct our research and development activities.

We may
need additional funding in the future, which may not be available to us, and
which may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development
programs or commercialization efforts.

We will
need to expend substantial resources for research and development, including
costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates. We believe our
existing capital resources, including funding we are entitled to receive under
our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet operating needs through at
least 2012; however, one or more of our collaboration agreements may terminate,
our projected revenue may decrease, or our expenses may increase and that would
lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time. We may
require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise such
additional funds. If we are able to obtain additional financing through the sale
of equity or convertible debt securities, such sales may be dilutive to our
shareholders. Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain
assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or
our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are
not favorable to our shareholders. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to
complete the development of our product candidates, we may face delay, reduction
or elimination of our research and development programs or preclinical or
clinical trials, in which case our business, financial condition or results of
operations may be materially harmed.

The
value of our investment portfolio, which includes cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities, is influenced by varying economic and market conditions.
A decrease in the value of an asset in our investment portfolio or a default by
the issuer may result in our inability to recover the principal we invested
and/or a recognition of a loss charged against income.

As of
December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable
securities totaled $527.5 million and represented 79% of our total assets. We
have invested available cash balances primarily in money market funds and U.S.
Treasury, U.S. government agency, corporate, and asset-backed securities. We
consider assets classified as marketable securities to be “available-for-sale,”
as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities

. Marketable securities
totaled $278.0 million at December 31, 2008, are carried at fair value, and the
unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive
income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. If the decline in
the value of a security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, we write down the security to its current fair value and
recognize a loss that is charged against income. For example, during the year
ended December 31, 2008, we recorded charges for other-than-temporary
impairments totaling $2.5 million related to two marketable securities in our
investment portfolio. The current economic environment, the deterioration in the
credit quality of some of the issuers of securities that we hold, and the recent
volatility of securities markets increase the risk that we may not recover the
principal we invested and/or there may be further declines in the market value
of securities in our investment portfolio. As a result, we may incur additional
charges against income in future periods for other-than-temporary impairments or
realized losses upon a security’s sale or maturity, and such amounts may be
material.


Risks Related to ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) and the Development of
Our Product Candidates

Successful development of any of our product candidates is highly
uncertain.

Only a
small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in
commercially successful drugs. Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and
effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the
necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any of
our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients, the
medical community, and third-party payers and on our partners’ ability to
successfully manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Our product
candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion or by intravitreal or
subcutaneous injections, which are generally less well received by patients than
tablet or capsule delivery. If our products are not successfully commercialized,
we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in
developing such products and our business would be severely harmed.

We are
studying aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, ARCALYST, and our antibody candidates in a
wide variety of indications. Many of these current trials are exploratory
studies designed to identify what diseases and uses, if any, are best suited for
our product candidates. It is likely that our product candidates will not
demonstrate the requisite efficacy and/or safety profile to support continued
development for most of the indications that are being, or are planned to be,
studied. In fact, our product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite
efficacy and safety profile to support the continued development for any of the
indications or uses.

Clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and
time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. If any of our drug trials
are delayed or yield unfavorable results, we will have to delay or may be unable
to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.

We must
conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain
regulatory approval to market and sell them. We need to conduct both preclinical
animal testing and human clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a lengthy,
time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and trials may not achieve
favorable results for many reasons, including, among others, failure of the
product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious
or life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or connected with
exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in enrolling and maintaining
subjects in the clinical trial, lack of sufficient supplies of the product
candidate or comparator drug, and the failure of clinical investigators, trial
monitors and other consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan
or protocol. A clinical trial may fail because it did not include a sufficient
number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical
significance. A clinical trial may also fail because the dose(s) of the
investigational drug included in the trial were either too low or too high to
determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting.

We will
need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either
conduct new trials, which are expensive and time consuming, or abandon the drug
development program. Even if we obtain positive results from preclinical or
clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Many
companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered
significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results have been
obtained in earlier trials. The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety
and effectiveness for the desired indication(s) could harm the development of
our product candidate(s), and our business, financial condition, and results of
operations may be materially harmed.

Serious complications or side effects have occurred, and may continue to
occur, in connection with the use of our approved product and in clinical trials
of some of our product candidates which could cause our regulatory approval to
be revoked or otherwise negatively affected or lead to delay or discontinuation
of development of our product candidates which could severely harm our
business.

During
the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health,
including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it
is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied
caused these conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have been
reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our product candidates. It
is possible as we test our drug candidates in larger, longer, and more extensive
clinical programs, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were observed in
earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in
smaller previous trials, will be reported by patients. Many times, side effects
are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large scale, Phase
3 clinical trials or, in some


cases, after they are made available to
patients after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of
our product candidates has many side effects or causes serious or
life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail
or be delayed, which would severely harm our business.

Our
aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is being studied for the potential treatment of certain
types of cancer and our VEGF Trap-Eye candidate is being studied in diseases of
the eye. There are many potential safety concerns associated with significant
blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, that may limit our
ability to successfully develop aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye. These serious and
potentially life-threatening risks, based on clinical and preclinical experience
of VEGF inhibitors, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension,
proteinuria, heart attack, and stroke. In addition, patients given infusions of
any protein, including VEGF Trap delivered through intravenous administration,
may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF
blockers have reported side effects that became evident only after large scale
trials or after marketing approval and large number of patients were treated.
These and other complications or side effects could harm the development of
aflibercept for the treatment of cancer or VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of
diseases of the eye.

We have
tested ARCALYST in only a small number of patients with CAPS. As more patients
begin to use our product and as we test it in new disease settings, new risks
and side effects associated with ARCALYST may be discovered, and risks
previously viewed as inconsequential could be determined to be significant. Like
cytokine antagonists such as Kineret

®

(Amgen, Inc.), Enbrel

®

(Immunex
Corporation), and Remicade

®

(Centocor,
Inc.), ARCALYST affects the immune defense system of the body by blocking some
of its functions. Therefore, ARCALYST may interfere with the body’s ability to
fight infections. Treatment with Kineret (Amgen), a medication that works
through the inhibition of IL-1, has been associated with an increased risk of
serious infections, and serious, life threatening infections have been reported
in patients taking ARCALYST. These or other complications or side effects could
cause regulatory authorities to revoke approvals of ARCALYST. Alternatively, we
may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in the
labeling of our product, or limit or abandon our efforts to develop ARCALYST in
new disease settings. These side effects may also result in a reduction, or even
the elimination, of sales of ARCALYST in approved indications.

ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) and our product candidates in development are recombinant
proteins that could cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of
harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic
protein.

In
addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by
our product candidates, the administration of recombinant proteins frequently
causes an immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the
therapeutic protein. The antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize
the effectiveness of the protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain
a therapeutic effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react with the
patient’s own proteins, resulting in an “auto-immune” type disease. Whether
antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or
clinical experiments, and their detection or appearance is often delayed, so
that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be detected
at a later date, in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been
completed. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were
detected in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55
subjects (35%) who received ARCALYST for at least 6 weeks tested positive for
treatment-emerging binding antibodies on at least one occasion. To date, no side
effects related to antibodies were observed in these subjects and there were no
observed effects on drug efficacy or drug levels. It is possible that as we
continue to test aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye with more sensitive assays in
different patient populations and larger clinical trials, we will find that
subjects given aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye develop antibodies to these product
candidates, and may also experience side effects related to the antibodies,
which could adversely impact the development of such candidates.

We may
be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is
suitable for clinical or commercial use.

Changes
in product formulations and manufacturing processes may be required as product
candidates progress in clinical development and are ultimately commercialized.
If we are unable to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing
processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product candidates,
including aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and our antibody candidates, we may be
unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials, which would delay
the development of our product candidates. Similarly, if we are unable to supply
sufficient quantities of our product or develop product formulations suitable
for commercial use, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our
product candidates.


Risks Related to Intellectual
Property

If we
cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are
insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive
position will be harmed.

Our
business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other
information that we protect as trade secrets. We seek to prevent improper
disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements. If our
trade secrets are improperly exposed, either by our own employees or our
collaborators, it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business.
We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third
parties only to the extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable
patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. The patent position of
biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual questions and,
therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Our patents may be
challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Patent applications filed outside the
United States may be challenged by third parties who file an opposition. Such
opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the European Union and are
costly to defend. We have patent applications that are being opposed and it is
likely that we will need to defend additional patent applications in the future.
Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive
advantages against competitors. Furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to
us, the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely
expensive and time consuming.

We may
be restricted in our development and/or commercialization activities by, and
could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed, third party
patents or other proprietary rights.

Our
commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without
infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Other
parties may allege that they have blocking patents to our products in clinical
development, either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the
composition of a product or the way it is manufactured or used. Moreover, other
parties may allege that they have blocking patents to antibody products made
using our

VelocImmune

®

technology, either because of the way the
antibodies are discovered or produced or because of a proprietary position
covering an antibody or the antibody’s target.

We are
aware of patents and pending applications owned by Genentech that claim certain
chimeric VEGF receptor compositions. Although we do not believe that aflibercept
or VEGF Trap-Eye infringes any valid claim in these patents or patent
applications, Genentech could initiate a lawsuit for patent infringement and
assert that its patents are valid and cover aflibercept or VEGF Trap-Eye.
Genentech may be motivated to initiate such a lawsuit at some point in an effort
to impair our ability to develop and sell aflibercept or VEGF Trap-Eye, which
represent potential competitive threats to Genentech’s VEGF-binding products and
product candidates. An adverse determination by a court in any such potential
patent litigation would likely materially harm our business by requiring us to
seek a license, which may not be available, or resulting in our inability to
manufacture, develop and sell aflibercept or VEGF Trap-Eye or in a damage
award.

We are
aware of patents and pending applications owned by Roche that claim antibodies
to the interleukin-6 receptor and methods of treating rheumatoid arthritis with
such antibodies. We are developing REGN88, an antibody to the interleukin-6
receptor, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although we do not believe
that REGN88 infringes any valid claim in these patents or patent applications,
Roche could initiate a lawsuit for patent infringement and assert its patents
are valid and cover REGN88.

We are
aware of a U.S. patent jointly owned by Genentech and City of Hope relating to
the production of recombinant antibodies in host cells. We currently produce our
antibody product candidates using recombinant antibodies from host cells and may
choose to produce additional antibody product candidates in this manner. 
Neither ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept), aflibercept, nor VEGF Trap-Eye are recombinant
antibodies.  If any of our antibody product candidates are produced in a
manner subject to valid claims in the Genentech patent, then we may need to
obtain a license from Genentech, should one be available.  Genentech has
licensed this patent to several different companies under confidential license
agreements.    If we desire a license for any of our antibody
product candidates and are unable to obtain a license on commercially reasonable
terms or at all, we may be restricted in our ability to use Genentech’s
techniques to make recombinant antibodies in or to import them into the United
States.

Further,
we are aware of a number of other third party patent applications that, if
granted, with claims as currently drafted, may cover our current or planned
activities. We cannot assure you that our products and/or actions in
manufacturing and selling our product candidates will not infringe such
patents.

Any
patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from
manufacturing, selling, or developing our drug candidates, and a court may find
that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties. In the event
that the manufacture, use, or sale of any of our clinical candidates infringes
on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of third parties, we may be
prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing, and
commercialization of our drugs and may be required to pay costly damages. Such a
result may materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. Legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to
defend.


We seek
to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment, such licenses are needed.
If any licenses are required, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain any such license
could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our
product candidates, which could severely harm our business.

Regulatory and Litigation
Risks

If we
do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will not be
able to market or sell them.

We cannot
sell or market products without regulatory approval. Although we obtained
regulatory approval for ARCALYST

for the treatment of CAPS in the United
States, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of ARCALYST in any other
country or in any other indication. Regulatory agencies outside the United
States may require additional information or data with respect to any future
submission for ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS.

If we do
not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates,
including ARCALYST for the treatment of diseases other than CAPS, the value of
our company and our results of operations will be harmed. In the United States,
we must obtain and maintain approval from the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for each drug we intend to sell. Obtaining FDA approval is
typically a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain.
Foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and
approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process, and
approval is highly uncertain. Except for the FDA approval of ARCALYST for the
treatment of CAPS, none of our product candidates has ever received regulatory
approval to be marketed and sold in the United States or any other country. We
may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product
candidates.

Before
approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA requires that the facilities
at which the product will be manufactured be in compliance with current good
manufacturing practices, or cGMP requirements. Manufacturing product candidates
in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex, time-consuming, and
expensive. To be successful, our products must be manufactured for development,
following approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory
requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any of our product
collaborators or third-party manufacturers, product packagers, or labelers are
unable to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory
sanctions, including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending
application for a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing
approval. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations may be materially harmed.

In
addition to the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations in the United
States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing
human clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and approval of drugs, and
commercial sale and distribution of drugs in foreign countries. The foreign
regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA
approval as well as country specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA
approval for a product in the United States, we must obtain approval by the
comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence
clinical trials or marketing of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS or any of our
product candidates in those countries.

If the
testing or use of our products harms people, we could be subject to costly and
damaging product liability claims.

The
testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use in people expose us
to product liability risk. Any informed consent or waivers obtained from people
who sign up for our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the
cost of litigation. We may be subject to claims by CAPS patients who use
ARCALYST that they have been injured by a side effect associated with the drug.
Our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may
not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation. Moreover,
we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our
insurance on acceptable terms.

If we
market and sell ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) in a way that violates federal or state fraud and abuse
laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

In
addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health
care “fraud and abuse” laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the
anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, and other state and
federal laws and regulations. Federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit,
among other things, knowingly


and willfully offering, paying,
soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing,
leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health
care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally
or state financed health care programs.

Federal
false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to
be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly
making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.
Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of
alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free
product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal
programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average
wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement
rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, or
off-label uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered
off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid
Rebate program.

The
majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal
anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services
reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply
regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may
include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from
reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and
imprisonment.

Even if
we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations
into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and
generate negative publicity, which would also harm our financial condition.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it
is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge
under one or more of such laws.

In recent
years, several states and localities, including California, the District of
Columbia, Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont, and West
Virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to
establish marketing compliance programs, and file periodic reports with the
state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical
trials, and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other
states. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the penalties for
failure to comply with these requirements are unclear. Nonetheless, if we are
found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement
action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse
publicity.

Our
operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental,
health, and safety laws and regulations. We may incur substantial liability
arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous
materials.

As a
biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing operations, we are
subject to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,
including those governing the use of hazardous materials. Our research and
development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of
chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous materials. The
cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is
substantial. If an accident involving these materials or an environmental
discharge were to occur, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, or
face regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or insurance
coverage.

Changes in the securities laws and regulations have increased, and are
likely to continue to increase, our costs.

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which became law in July 2002, has required changes
in some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and compliance
practices. In response to the requirements of that Act, the SEC and the NASDAQ
Stock Market have promulgated rules and listing standards covering a variety of
subjects. Compliance with these rules and listing standards has increased our
legal costs, and significantly increased our accounting and auditing costs, and
we expect these costs to continue. These developments may make it more difficult
and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance. Likewise, these developments may make it more difficult for us to
attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly
independent directors, or qualified executive officers.

In
future years, if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over
financial reporting is effective, the market value of our Common Stock could be
adversely affected.

As
directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules
requiring public companies to include a report of management on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K
that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial


reporting. In addition, the independent
registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest
to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm provided us with an
unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, which report is included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. However,
we cannot assure you that management or our independent registered public
accounting firm will be able to provide such an unqualified report as of future
year-ends. In this event, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of
our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the market value
of our Common Stock. In addition, if it is determined that deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls exist and that they are reasonably
likely to adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize, and report
financial information, we would likely incur additional costs to remediate these
deficiencies and the costs of such remediation could be material.

Changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could
adversely affect our business.

All
aspects of our business, including research and development, manufacturing,
marketing, pricing, sales, litigation, and intellectual property rights, are
subject to extensive legislation and regulation. Changes in applicable federal
and state laws and agency regulations could have a material adverse effect on
our business. These include:

changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory
  processes for new therapeutics that may delay or prevent the

approval of any of our current or future product
  candidates;

new laws, regulations, or judicial decisions
  related to healthcare availability or the payment for healthcare

products and services, including prescription drugs, that
  would make it more difficult for us to market and

sell products once they are approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory
  agencies; and

changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may
  require additional safety monitoring prior to or after the

introduction of new products to market, which could
  materially increase our costs of doing business.

The
enactment in the United States of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 and possible legislation which could ease the entry of
competing follow-on biologics into the marketplace are examples of changes and
possible changes in laws that could adversely affect our business.

Risks Related to Our Reliance on
Third Parties

If our
antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis is terminated, our business
operations and our ability to discover, develop, manufacture, and commercialize
our pipeline of product candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be
materially harmed.

We rely
heavily on the funding from sanofi-aventis to support our target discovery and
antibody research and development programs. Sanofi-aventis has committed to pay
up to $400 million between 2009 and 2012 to fund our efforts to identify and
validate drug discovery targets and pre-clinically develop fully human
monoclonal antibodies against such targets. In addition, sanofi-aventis funds
almost all of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection
with the clinical development of antibodies that sanofi-aventis elects to
co-develop with us. We rely on sanofi-aventis to fund these activities. In
addition, with respect to those antibodies that sanofi-aventis elects to
co-develop with us, such as REGN88, REGN421, and REGN475, we rely on
sanofi-aventis to lead much of the clinical development efforts and assist with
obtaining regulatory approval, particularly outside the United States. We also
rely on sanofi-aventis to lead the commercialization efforts to support all of
the antibody products that are co-developed by sanofi-aventis and us. If
sanofi-aventis does not elect to co-develop the antibodies that we discover or
opts-out of their development, we would be required to fund and oversee on our
own the clinical trials, any regulatory responsibilities, and the ensuing
commercialization efforts to support our antibody products. If sanofi-aventis
terminates the antibody collaboration or fails to comply with its payment
obligations thereunder, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations would be materially harmed. We would be required to either expend
substantially more resources than we have anticipated to support our research
and development efforts, which could require us to seek additional funding that
might not be available on favorable terms or at all, or materially cut back on
such activities. While we cannot assure you that any of the antibodies from this
collaboration will ever be successfully developed and commercialized, if
sanofi-aventis does not perform its obligations with respect to antibodies that
it elects to co-develop, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize
these antibody product candidates will be significantly adversely affected.


If our
collaboration with sanofi-aventis for aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is terminated, or
sanofi-aventis materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business
operations and financial condition, and our ability to develop, manufacture, and
commercialize aflibercept in the time expected, or at all, would be materially
harmed.

We rely
heavily on sanofi-aventis to lead much of the development of aflibercept.
Sanofi-aventis funds all of the development expenses incurred by both companies
in connection with the aflibercept program. If the aflibercept program
continues, we will rely on sanofi-aventis to assist with funding the aflibercept
program, provide commercial manufacturing capacity, enroll and monitor clinical
trials, obtain regulatory approval, particularly outside the United States, and
lead the commercialization of aflibercept. While we cannot assure you that
aflibercept will ever be successfully developed and commercialized, if
sanofi-aventis does not perform its obligations in a timely manner, or at all,
our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize aflibercept in cancer
indications will be significantly adversely affected. Sanofi-aventis has the
right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon twelve
months advance notice. If sanofi-aventis were to terminate its collaboration
agreement with us, we would not have the resources or skills to replace those of
our partner, which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be
available on favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant delays in
the development and/or manufacture of aflibercept and result in substantial
additional costs to us. We have limited commercial capabilities and would have
to develop or outsource these capabilities. Termination of the sanofi-aventis
collaboration agreement for aflibercept would create substantial new and
additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of
aflibercept.

If our
collaboration with Bayer HealthCare for VEGF Trap-Eye is terminated, or Bayer
HealthCare materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business
operations and financial condition, and our ability to develop and commercialize
VEGF Trap-Eye in the time expected, or at all, would be materially
harmed.

We rely
heavily on Bayer HealthCare to assist with the development of VEGF Trap-Eye.
Under our agreement with them, Bayer HealthCare is required to fund
approximately half of the development expenses incurred by both companies in
connection with the global VEGF Trap-Eye development program. If the VEGF
Trap-Eye program continues, we will rely on Bayer HealthCare to assist with
funding the VEGF Trap-Eye development program, lead the development of VEGF
Trap-Eye outside the United States, obtain regulatory approval outside the
United States, and provide all sales, marketing and commercial support for the
product outside the United States. In particular, Bayer HealthCare has
responsibility for selling VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States using its
sales force. While we cannot assure you that VEGF Trap-Eye will ever be
successfully developed and commercialized, if Bayer HealthCare does not perform
its obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to develop,
manufacture, and commercialize VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States will be
significantly adversely affected. Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate
its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months
advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination. If
Bayer HealthCare were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us, we would
not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner, which could
require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable
terms or at all, and could cause significant delays in the development and/or
commercialization of VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States and result in
substantial additional costs to us. We have limited commercial capabilities and
would have to develop or outsource these capabilities outside the United States.
Termination of the Bayer HealthCare collaboration agreement would create
substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and
commercialization of VEGF Trap-Eye.

Our
collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their
efforts to support the development, manufacture, and commercialization of
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)
and our drug candidates.

We depend
upon third-party collaborators, including sanofi-aventis, Bayer HealthCare, and
service providers such as clinical research organizations, outside testing
laboratories, clinical investigator sites, and third-party manufacturers and
product packagers and labelers, to assist us in the manufacture and development
of our product candidates. If any of our existing collaborators or service
providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its
development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner or
at all, we could experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the
manufacture, development, or ultimate commercialization of our product
candidates.

We rely
on third party service providers to support the distribution of ARCALYST and
many other related activities in connection with the commercialization of
ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS. We cannot be certain that these third
parties will perform adequately. If these service providers do not perform their
services adequately, our efforts to market and sell ARCALYST for the treatment
of CAPS will not be successful.


Risks Related to the Manufacture of
Our Product Candidates

We
have limited manufacturing capacity, which could inhibit our ability to
successfully develop or commercialize our drugs.

Our
manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce sufficient
quantities of product for commercial sale. We intend to rely on our corporate
collaborators, as well as contract manufacturers, to produce the large
quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products. We
rely entirely on third-party manufacturers for filling and finishing services.
We will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver material on a timely
basis and to comply with regulatory requirements. If we are unable to supply
sufficient material on acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or
difficulties in our relationships with our corporate collaborators or contract
manufacturers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may
be materially harmed.

We must
expand our own manufacturing capacity to support the planned growth of our
clinical pipeline. Moreover, we may expand our manufacturing capacity to support
commercial production of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, for our
product candidates. This will require substantial additional expenditures, and
we will need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial
personnel to staff our facility. Start-up costs can be large and scale-up
entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing
yields. We may be unable to develop manufacturing facilities that are sufficient
to produce drug material for clinical trials or commercial use. This may delay
our clinical development plans and interfere with our efforts to commercialize
our products. In addition, we may be unable to secure adequate filling and
finishing services to support our products. As a result, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.

We may be
unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)

and our product candidates. In addition, we may face
difficulties in developing or acquiring production technology and managerial
personnel to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at
reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and
environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements.

If any
of our clinical programs are discontinued, we may face costs related to the
unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities.

We have
large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New York. We use our
facilities to produce bulk product for clinical and preclinical candidates for
ourselves and our collaborations. If our clinical candidates are discontinued,
we will have to absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and
inefficiencies.

Third-party supply failures or a business interruption at our
manufacturing facility in Rensselaer, New York could adversely affect our
ability to supply our products.

We
manufacture all of our bulk drug materials for ARCALYST and our product
candidates at our manufacturing facility in Rensselaer, New York. We would be
unable to supply our product requirements if we were to cease production due to
regulatory requirements or action, business interruptions, labor shortages or
disputes, contaminations, or other problems at the facility.

Certain
raw materials necessary for manufacturing and formulation of ARCALYST and our
product candidates are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party
suppliers. In addition, we rely on certain third parties to perform filling,
finishing, distribution, and other services related to the manufacture of our
products. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials or services for an
indeterminate period of time if any of these third-parties were to cease or
interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials, products, or
services to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or
action, adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, business
interruptions, or labor shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially
and adversely affect our ability to manufacture or supply ARCALYST or our
product candidates for use in clinical trials, which could materially and
adversely affect our business and future prospects.

Also,
certain of the raw materials required in the manufacturing and the formulation
of our clinical candidates may be derived from biological sources, including
mammalian tissues, bovine serum, and human serum albumin. There are certain
European regulatory restrictions on using these biological source materials. If
we are required to substitute for these sources to comply with European
regulatory requirements, our clinical development activities may be delayed or
interrupted.


Risks Related to Commercialization
of Products

If we
are unable to establish sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, or
enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will be unable to
successfully market and sell future products.

We are
marketing and selling ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS ourselves in the United
States, primarily through third party service providers. We have no sales or
distribution personnel in the United States and have only a small staff with
commercial capabilities. We have no sales, marketing, commercial, or
distribution capabilities outside the United States. If we are unable to obtain
those capabilities, either by developing our own organizations or entering into
agreements with service providers, even if our current or future product
candidates receive marketing approval, we will not be able to successfully sell
those products. In that event, we will not be able to generate significant
revenue, even if our product candidates are approved. We cannot guarantee that
we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need or
that we will be able to enter into marketing or distribution agreements with
third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all. Under the terms of our
collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, we currently rely on sanofi-aventis
for sales, marketing, and distribution of aflibercept in cancer indications,
should it be approved in the future by regulatory authorities for marketing. We
will have to rely on a third party or devote significant resources to develop
our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our other product
candidates, including VEGF Trap-Eye in the United States, and we may be
unsuccessful in developing our own sales, marketing, and distribution
organization.

There
may be too few patients with CAPS to profitably commercialize
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) in
this indication.

Our only
approved product is ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare,
inherited auto-inflammatory diseases. These rare diseases affect a very small
group of people. The incidence of CAPS has been reported to be approximately 1
in 1,000,000 people in the United States. Although the incidence rate of CAPS in
Europe has not been reported, it is known to be a rare set of diseases. As a
result, there may be too few patients with CAPS to profitably commercialize
ARCALYST in this indication.

Even
if our product candidates are approved for marketing, their commercial success
is highly uncertain because our competitors have received approval for products
with a similar mechanism of action, and competitors may get to the marketplace
with better or lower cost drugs.

There is
substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and chemical companies. Many of our competitors
have substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical product
development and manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human
resources than we do. Our smaller competitors may also enhance their competitive
position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even if we achieve
product commercialization, our competitors have achieved, and may continue to
achieve, product commercialization before our products are approved for
marketing and sale.

Genentech
has an approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

(beracizumab), on the market
for treating certain cancers and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies are working to develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis,
OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Pfizer. Many of these molecules are farther along
in development than aflibercept and may offer competitive advantages over our
molecule. Each of Pfizer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, (together with its partner
Bayer HealthCare) has received approval from the FDA to market and sell an oral
medication that targets tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that
fuels the growth of tumors. The marketing approvals for Genentech’s VEGF
antagonist, Avastin, and their extensive, ongoing clinical development plan for
Avastin in other cancer indications, make it more difficult for us to enroll
patients in clinical trials to support aflibercept and to obtain regulatory
approval of aflibercept in these cancer settings. This may delay or impair our
ability to successfully develop and commercialize aflibercept. In addition, even
if aflibercept is ever approved for sale for the treatment of certain cancers,
it will be difficult for our drug to compete against Avastin (Genentech) and the
FDA approved kinase inhibitors, because doctors and patients will have
significant experience using these medicines. In addition, an oral medication
may be considerably less expensive for patients than a biologic medication,
providing a competitive advantage to companies that market such
products.


The
market for eye disease products is also very competitive. Novartis and Genentech
are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a VEGF
antibody fragment, ranibizumab (Lucentis

®

), for the treatment of
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and other eye indications that was
approved by the FDA in June 2006. Many other companies are working on the
development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD and DME
that act by blocking VEGF, VEGF receptors, and through the use of small
interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene expression. In
addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label a third-party reformatted version
of Genentech’s approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin

®

, with success for the
treatment of wet AMD. The National Eye Institute is conducting a Phase 3 trial
comparing Lucentis (Genentech) to Avastin (Genentech) in the treatment of wet
AMD. The marketing approval of Lucentis (Genentech) and the potential off-label
use of Avastin (Genentech) make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in
our clinical trials and successfully develop VEGF Trap-Eye. Even if VEGF
Trap-Eye is ever approved for sale for the treatment of eye diseases, it may be
difficult for our drug to compete against Lucentis (Genentech), because doctors
and patients will have significant experience using this medicine. Moreover, the
relatively low cost of therapy with Avastin

(Genentech) in patients with wet AMD presents
a further competitive challenge in this indication.

The
availability of highly effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists such as
Enbrel

®

(Immunex), Remicade

®

(Centocor), and Humira

®

(Abbott Laboratories), and
the IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret

®

(Amgen), and other marketed
therapies makes it more difficult to successfully develop and commercialize
ARCALYST. This is one of the reasons we discontinued the development of ARCALYST
in adult rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, even if ARCALYST is ever approved
for sale in indications where TNF-antagonists are approved, it will be difficult
for our drug to compete against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists because
doctors and patients will have significant experience using these effective
medicines. Moreover, in such indications these approved therapeutics may offer
competitive advantages over ARCALYST, such as requiring fewer injections.

There are
both small molecules and antibodies in development by other companies that are
designed to block the synthesis of interleukin-1 or inhibit the signaling of
interleukin-1. For example, Eli Lilly, Xoma, and Novartis are each developing
antibodies to interleukin-1 and Amgen is developing an antibody to the
interleukin-1 receptor. Novartis has filed applications in the U.S. and Europe
seeking regulatory approval of its IL-1 antibody in CAPS. Novartis is also
developing its IL-1 antibody in gout and other inflammatory diseases. Novartis
has stated that its IL-1 antibody demonstrated long-lasting clinical remission
in patients with CAPS and that its clinical candidate could develop into a major
therapeutic advance in the treatment of CAPS. Novartis’ IL-1 antibody and these
other drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over ARCALYST. The
successful development of these competing molecules could impair our ability to
successfully commercialize ARCALYST.

We have
plans to develop ARCALYST for the treatment of certain gout indications.
Currently, inexpensive, oral therapies such as analgesics and other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used as the standard of care to treat
the symptoms of these gout diseases. These established, inexpensive, orally
delivered drugs may make it difficult for us to successfully commercialize
ARCALYST in these diseases.

The
successful commercialization of ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)
and our product candidates will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement
for use of these products from third-party payers and these payers may not agree
to cover or reimburse for use of our products.

Our
product candidates, if commercialized, may be significantly more expensive than
traditional drug treatments. For example, we have announced plans to initiate a
Phase 3 program studying the use of ARCALYST for the treatment of certain gout
indications. Patients suffering from these gout indications are currently
treated with inexpensive therapies, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs. These existing treatment options are likely to be considerably less
expensive and may be preferable to a biologic medication for some patients. Our
future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if United States
and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and payers, and other
third-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, do not agree to defray or
reimburse the cost of our products to the patients. If these entities refuse to
provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to our products or provide an
insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our products may be too costly
for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe them. Many
third-party payers cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are not
preferred by such payer more expensive for patients, and require prior
authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a
particular drug. Payers may especially impose these obstacles to coverage on
higher-priced drugs, as our product candidates are likely to be.


We market
and sell ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) in the United States for the treatment of a
group of rare genetic disorders called CAPS. There may be too few patients with
CAPS to profitably commercialize ARCALYST. Physicians may not prescribe
ARCALYST, and CAPS patients may not be able to afford ARCALYST, if third party
payers do not agree to reimburse the cost of ARCALYST therapy and this would
adversely affect our ability to commercialize ARCALYST profitably.

In
addition to potential restrictions on coverage, the amount of reimbursement for
our products may also reduce our profitability. In the United States, there have
been, and we expect will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and
reduce healthcare costs. Government and other third-party payers are challenging
the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting, and
attempting to limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription
drugs.

Since
ARCALYST and our product candidates in clinical development, will likely be too
expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if our
products are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party
payers our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be
adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of our products or any decrease in
the price of our products will have a material adverse effect on our ability to
achieve profitability.

In
certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage, and level of reimbursement of
prescription drugs are subject to governmental control, and we may be unable to
negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to
us. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved
before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary
widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options
for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which
their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the
prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a
specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of
direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the
medicinal product on the market. Our results of operations may suffer if we are
unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and
reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited.

Risk Related to
Employees

We are
dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in
our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our
business will be harmed.

We are
highly dependent on certain of our executive officers. If we are not able to
retain any of these persons or our Chairman, our business may suffer. In
particular, we depend on the services of P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., the Chairman of
our board of directors, Leonard Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our President and Chief
Executive Officer, George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice
President, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron Research
Laboratories, and Neil Stahl, Ph.D., our Senior Vice President, Research and
Development Sciences. There is intense competition in the biotechnology industry
for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development,
manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We may not be able to continue to
attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our
business.

Our
move to new facilities in mid-2009 could lead to disruptions in our business
operations.

We plan
to move most of our laboratories and headquarters to new facilities in mid-2009.
There is a risk that this physical move could lead to damage to equipment or
other business assets or the loss of important data, or that we could encounter
problems with our new facilities, which could disrupt or delay our business
operations.

Risks Related to Our Common
Stock

Our
stock price is extremely volatile.

There has
been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market
prices of biotechnology companies’ securities. Various factors and events may
have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock. These factors
include, by way of example:


progress, delays, or adverse results in clinical
  trials;

announcement of technological innovations or
  product candidates by us or competitors;

fluctuations in our operating
  results;

third party claims that our products or
  technologies infringe their party patents;

public concern as to the safety or effectiveness
  of ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) or any of our product

candidates;

developments in our relationship with
  collaborative partners;

developments in the biotechnology industry or in
  government regulation of healthcare;

large sales of our common stock by our executive
  officers, directors, or significant shareholders;

arrivals and departures of key personnel;
  and

general market conditions.

The
trading price of our Common Stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to
wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors, including the sale or
attempted sale of a large amount of our Common Stock in the market. Broad market
fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our Common
Stock.

Future
sales of our Common Stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our
stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share
offerings.

A small
number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our Common
Stock. As of December 31, 2008, our five largest shareholders plus Leonard S.
Schleifer, M.D. Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 55.9% of
our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming, in the case of our Chief
Executive Officer, the conversion of his Class A Stock into Common Stock and the
exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days of
December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, sanofi-aventis beneficially owned
14,799,552 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 19.1% the shares
of Common Stock then outstanding. Under our investor agreement with
sanofi-aventis, sanofi-aventis may not sell these shares until December 20, 2012
except under limited circumstances and subject to earlier termination of these
restrictions upon the occurrence of certain events. Notwithstanding these
restrictions, if sanofi-aventis, or our other significant shareholders or we,
sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, or the
perception that such sales may occur exists, the market price of our Common
Stock could fall. Sales of Common Stock by our significant shareholders,
including sanofi-aventis, also might make it more difficult for us to raise
funds by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and
price that we deem appropriate.

Our
existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters
requiring shareholder approval.

Holders
of Class A Stock, who are generally the shareholders who purchased their stock
from us before our initial public offering, are entitled to ten votes per share,
while holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. As of December
31, 2008, holders of Class A Stock held 22.5% of the combined voting power of
all shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock then outstanding, plus any voting
power associated with any shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such
Class A Stock holders. These shareholders, if acting together, would be in a
position to significantly influence the election of our directors and to effect
or prevent certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority
approval of the combined classes, including mergers and other business
combinations. This may result in us taking corporate actions that you may not
consider to be in your best interest and may affect the price of our Common
Stock. As of December 31, 2008:

our current executive officers and directors
  beneficially owned 13.3% of our outstanding shares of Common

Stock, assuming conversion of their Class A Stock into
  Common Stock and the exercise of all options held

by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31,
  2008, and 28.0% of the combined

voting power of
  our outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock, assuming the
  exercise of all

options held by such persons
  which are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2008; and


our five largest shareholders plus Leonard S.
  Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer,

beneficially owned 55.9% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock,
  assuming, in the case of our

Chief Executive
  Officer, the conversion of his Class A Stock into Common Stock and the
  exercise of

all options held by him which are
  exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2008. In addition, these

six shareholders held 59.6% of the combined voting
  power of our outstanding shares of Common Stock

and Class A Stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by our
  Chief Executive Officer which are

exercisable
  within 60 days of December 31, 2008.

Pursuant to an investor agreement,
sanofi-aventis has agreed to vote its shares, at sanofi-aventis’ election,
either as recommended by our board of directors or proportionally with the votes
cast by our other shareholders, except with respect to certain change of control
transactions, liquidation or dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding
10% of the then outstanding shares or voting rights of Common Stock and Class A
Stock, and new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially
consistent with our historical equity compensation practices.

The
anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and of New York
corporate law and the contractual “standstill” provisions in our investor
agreement with sanofi-aventis, could deter, delay, or prevent an acquisition or
other “change in control” of us and could adversely affect the price of our
Common Stock.

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and the New York
Business Corporation Law contain various provisions that could have the effect
of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management
that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. Some of these provisions
could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other
shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These
provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in
the future for shares of our Common Stock. These provisions include:

authorization to issue “blank check” preferred
  stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and

issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder
  approval, with rights senior to those of our

common shareholders;

a staggered board of directors, so that it would
  take three successive annual meetings to replace all of our

directors;

a requirement that removal of directors may only
  be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative

vote of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares
  entitled to vote for directors, as well as a

requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled
  only by the remaining directors;

any action required or permitted to be taken at
  any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a

meeting, only if, prior to such action, all of our shareholders
  consent, the effect of which is to require that

shareholder action may only be taken at a duly convened
  meeting;

any shareholder seeking to bring business before
  an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely

notice of this intention in writing and meet various other
  requirements; and

under the New York Business Corporation Law, in
  addition to certain restrictions which may apply to

“business combinations” involving the Company and an “interested
  shareholder”, a plan of merger or

consolidation
  of the Company must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all outstanding
  shares

entitled to vote thereon. See the risk
  factor immediately above captioned “

Our
  existing shareholders may

be able to
  exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder
  approval.

”

Until the
later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of our
antibody collaboration agreements with sanofi-aventis or our aflibercept
collaboration with sanofi-aventis, sanofi-aventis will be bound by certain
“standstill” provisions, which contractually prohibit sanofi-aventis from
acquiring more than certain specified percentages of our Class A Stock and
Common Stock (taken together) or otherwise seeking to obtain control of the
Company.

In
addition, we have a Change in Control Severance Plan and our Chief Executive
Officer has an employment agreement that provides severance benefits in the
event our officers are terminated as a result of a change in control of the
Company. Many of our stock options issued under our Amended and Restated 2000
Long-Term Incentive Plan may become fully vested in connection with a “change in
control” of our company, as defined in the plan.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We
conduct our research, development, manufacturing, and administrative activities
at our owned and leased facilities. Under our main operating lease, as amended,
we currently lease approximately 248,000 square feet of laboratory and office
facilities in Tarrytown, New York.

In
December 2006, we entered into a new operating lease agreement (as amended in
October 2007 and September 2008) to lease approximately 348,000 square feet of
laboratory and office space at our current Tarrytown location, which includes
approximately 118,000 square feet retained from our current space and
approximately 230,000 square feet in new facilities that are under construction
and expected to be completed in mid-2009. The term of the lease commenced
effective June 2008 and will expire in June 2024. Under the new lease, we also
have various options and rights on additional space at the Tarrytown site, and
will continue to lease our present facilities until the new facilities are ready
for occupancy. In addition, the lease contains three renewal options to extend
the term of the lease by five years each and early termination options for our
retained facilities only. The lease provides for monthly payments over the term
of the lease related to our retained facilities, the costs of construction and
tenant improvements for our new facilities, and additional charges for
utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.

In
November 2007, we entered into a new operating sublease for approximately 10,000
square feet of office space in Tarrytown, New York. The lease expires in
September 2009 and we have the option to extend the term for two additional
terms of three months each. In April 2008, we entered into a new operating
sublease for approximately 16,200 square feet of office space in Tarrytown, New
York. The lease expires in March 2010 and we have the option to extend the term
one additional term of six months. In October 2008, we entered into a new
operating sublease for approximately 14,100 square feet of office space in
Bridgewater, New Jersey. The lease commences in January 2009 and expires in July
2011.

We own
facilities in Rensselaer, New York, consisting of three buildings totaling
approximately 395,500 square feet of research, manufacturing, office, and
warehouse space.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a
biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and commercializes
pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions. We
currently have one marketed product: ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) Injection
for Subcutaneous Use, which is now available for prescription in the United
States for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS),
including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells
Syndrome (MWS) in adults and children 12 and older. We also have six clinical
development programs, including three late-stage clinical programs. Our late
stage programs are aflibercept (VEGF Trap), which is being developed in oncology
in collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group, VEGF Trap-Eye, which is being
developed in eye diseases using intraocular delivery in collaboration with Bayer
HealthCare LLC, and ARCALYST which is being developed for the treatment of gout.
Our earlier stage clinical programs are REGN88, an antibody to the interleukin-6
receptor (IL-6R), REGN421, an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4 (Dll4), which is
being developed in rheumatoid arthritis, and REGN475, an antibody to Nerve
Growth Factor (NGF), which is being developed for the treatment of pain. All
three of these antibodies are being developed with sanofi-aventis. Our
preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis,
ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases and disorders,
inflammation and immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular
diseases.

Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and
expense. Since inception we have not generated any significant sales or profits
from the commercialization of ARCALYST or any of our other product candidates.
Before significant revenues from the commercialization of ARCALYST or our other
product candidates can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a
number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development
and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in
other countries. In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our
products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.

From
inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31, 2008, we had a cumulative loss
of $875.9 million. In the absence of significant revenues from the
commercialization of ARCALYST or our other product candidates or other sources,
the amount, timing, nature, and source of which cannot be predicted, our losses
will continue as we conduct our research and development activities. We expect
to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the
clinical development of VEGF Trap-Eye and ARCALYST; advance new product
candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs
utilizing our technologies for designing fully human monoclonal antibodies;
continue our research and development programs; and commercialize additional
product candidates that receive regulatory approval, if any. Also, our
activities may expand over time and require additional resources, and we expect
our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years. Our
losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other
factors, the progress of our research and development efforts, the timing of
certain expenses, and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from
collaborators.

As a
company that does not expect to be profitable over the next several years,
management of cash flow is extremely important. The most significant use of our
cash is for research and development activities, which include drug discovery,
preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the manufacture of drug supplies for
preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are reimbursed for some of these
research and development activities by our collaborators. Our principal sources
of cash to-date have been from (i) sales of common equity, both in public
offerings and to our


collaborators, including
sanofi-aventis, (ii) a private placement of convertible debt, which was repaid
in full during 2008, and (iii) funding from our collaborators in the form of
up-front payments, research progress payments, and payments for our research and
development activities.

In 2008,
our research and development expenses totaled $278.0 million. In 2009, we expect
these expenses to increase substantially as we (i) continue to expand our
research and preclinical and clinical development activities in connection with
our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis, (ii) expand our VEGF Trap-Eye,
ARCALYST, and aflibercept clinical programs, and (iii) increase our research and
development headcount.

A primary
driver of our expenses is our number of full-time employees. Our annual average
headcount in 2008 was 810 compared with 627 in 2007 and 573 in 2006. In 2008 our
average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded research and
development activities in connection with our antibody collaboration with
sanofi-aventis. In 2007 our average headcount increased primarily to support our
expanded development programs for VEGF Trap-Eye and ARCALYST and our plans to
move our first antibody candidate into clinical trials. In 2009, we expect our
average headcount to increase to approximately 950-1,000, primarily to support
the further expansion of our research, development, and marketing activities as
described above, especially in connection with our antibody collaboration with
sanofi-aventis.

The
planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant
factors that can affect our operating and financial results. In our clinical
programs, key events in 2008 and plans for 2009 are as follows:

Critical Accounting Policies and Use
of Estimates

A summary
of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in Note 2 to
our Financial Statements, beginning on page F-7. The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the
financial statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical
if:

It requires an assumption (or
  assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and

Changes in the estimate or the use of
  different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material

effect on our results of operations or financial
  condition.

Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts
reflected in our financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual
experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in
our financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a
material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. The critical
accounting estimates that impact our financial statements are described below.

Revenue
Recognition

Contract Research and Development
Revenue

We
recognize contract research and development revenue and research progress
payments in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB
104) and Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

(EITF 00-21). We earn contract
research and development revenue and research progress payments in connection
with collaboration and other agreements to develop and commercialize product
candidates and utilize our technology platforms. The terms of these agreements
typically include non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress
(milestone) payments, and payments for development activities. Non-refundable
up-front license payments, where continuing involvement is required of us, are
deferred and recognized over the related performance period. We estimate our
performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement, and adjust the
performance periods, if appropriate, based on the applicable facts and
circumstances. Payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive
performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue
when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and
non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation associated with
that milestone. Substantive performance milestones typically consist of
significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the related product
candidate, such as completion of clinical trials, filing for approval with
regulatory agencies, and approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining
whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, we take
into consideration (i) the nature, timing, and value of significant achievements
in the development life-cycle of the related development product candidate, (ii)
the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, and (iii) the
relative level of risk in achieving the milestone, taking into account the high
degree of uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a drug
development program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product.
Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are
accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance
period.

We enter
into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which
parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities. We
may share the costs of research and development activities with our
collaborator, such as in our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer HealthCare,
or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our
research and development activities, such as in our aflibercept and antibody
collaborations with sanofi-aventis. We record our internal and third-party
development costs associated with these collaborations as research and
development expenses. When we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion
of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we
record those reimbursable amounts as contract research and development revenue
proportionately as we recognize our expenses. If the collaboration is a
cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform
development work and share costs, in periods when our collaborator incurs
development expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, we also
recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of the
collaborator’s development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. In
addition, we record revenue in connection with a government research grant using
a proportional performance model as we incur expenses related to the grant,
subject to the grant’s terms and annual funding approvals.


In
connection with non-refundable licensing payments, our performance period
estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and
results of our research and development activities. Due to the variability in
the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product,
changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the
ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization,
revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically and
could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year
in the future. In addition, our estimated performance periods may change if
development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to
expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease
indications. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized
$2.6 million less in contract research and development revenue, compared to
amounts recognized in 2006, in connection with non-refundable up-front payments
previously received from sanofi-aventis pursuant to the companies’ aflibercept
collaboration, due to an extension of our estimated performance period. In
addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we extended our estimated
performance period in connection with the up-front and milestone payments
previously received from Bayer HealthCare pursuant to the companies’ VEGF
Trap-Eye collaboration and shortened our estimated performance period in
connection with up-front payments from sanofi-aventis pursuant to the companies’
aflibercept collaboration. The net effect of these changes in our estimates
resulted in the recognition of $0.4 million less in contract research and
development revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to amounts
recognized in connection with these deferred payments in each of the prior three
quarters of 2008. Also, if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance
with the terms of the agreement, we would recognize any unamortized remainder of
an up-front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination.

Product Revenue

In March
2008, ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) became available for prescription in the
United States for the treatment of CAPS. We recognize revenue from product sales
in accordance with SAB 104. Revenue from product sales is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated
risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable,
collection from the customer is reasonably assured, and we have no further
performance obligations. Revenue and deferred revenue from product sales are
recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay discounts, product returns,
estimated rebates payable under governmental programs (including Medicaid),
distributor fees, and other sales-related costs. We account for these reductions
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer

(Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)

(EITF 01-9), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. (SFAS) 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right
of Return Exists,

as applicable. In
accordance with EITF 01-9 and SFAS 48, since we currently have limited
historical return and rebate experience for ARCALYST, product sales revenues are
deferred until (i) the right of return no longer exists or we can reasonably
estimate returns and (ii) rebates have been processed or we can reasonably
estimate rebates. We review our estimates of rebates payable each period and
record any necessary adjustments in the current period’s net product
sales.

Clinical Trial
Expenses

Clinical
trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and
include costs associated with third-party contractors. We outsource a
substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external
entities such as contract research organizations, independent clinical
investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist us with the
execution of our clinical studies. For each clinical trial that we conduct,
certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while others are expensed
over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate
at which patients enter the trial, and the period over which clinical
investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide
services.

Clinical
activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative
functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by contract
research organizations (CROs). CROs typically perform most of the start-up
activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification,
screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management.
On a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total
contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly
wider, as many of our contracts with CROs are either expanded or reduced in
scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular
trial may not change materially. These start-up costs usually occur within a few
months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. The
remaining activities and related costs, such as patient


monitoring and administration,
generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study.
In the event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize
expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non-cancelable
obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or
penalties.

For
clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient
basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue on an
estimated cost-per-patient basis an expense based on subject enrollment and
activity in each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in a
quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the
study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required
level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and
drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study.
Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically
those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of
patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years.
During the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition
if actual results differ from our estimates. Our estimates and assumptions for
clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results,
which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development
expenses in future periods when the actual results become known. No material
adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the
years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007.

Stock-based Employee
Compensation

We
account for stock-based employee compensation under the provisions of SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

. We use the Black-Scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of
stock option awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated based on
assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
(ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of
directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives),
(iii) expected dividend yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with
maturities approximating the options’ expected lives. Expected volatility has
been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent
historical periods equivalent to the options’ expected lives. Expected lives are
principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with previously
issued employee and board of director option grants. The expected dividend yield
is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying
any in the foreseeable future.

The
assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best
estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many
of which are outside of our control. Changes in any of these assumptions may
materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of
stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.

In
addition, we have granted performance-based stock option awards which vest based
upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as
defined in the agreements. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant
date, related to these performance options will be recognized only if, and when,
these options’ performance conditions are considered to be probable of
attainment.

Marketable
Securities

We
consider our marketable securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government,
corporate, and asset-backed securities, to be “available-for-sale,” as defined
by SFAS 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.
These assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are
included in other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. If the decline in the value of a marketable
security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we
write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that is
charged against income.

On a
quarterly basis, we review our portfolio of marketable securities, using both
quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value
below cost are other-than-temporary. Such factors include the length of time and
the extent to which market value has been less than cost, financial condition
and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors,
and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. This review process also
includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities
until they mature or their full value can be recovered. This review is
subjective and requires a high degree of judgment.


As a
result of our quarterly reviews of our marketable securities portfolio, during
2008 and 2007, we recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of our
marketable securities totaling $2.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
However, the current economic environment, the deterioration in the credit
quality of some of the issuers of securities that we hold, and the recent
volatility of securities markets increase the risk that there could be further
declines in the market value of marketable securities in our investment
portfolio and that such declines could result in additional charges against
income in future periods for other-than-temporary impairments, and such amounts
could be material.

Depreciation of Property, Plant,
and Equipment

Property,
plant, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. In some situations, the life of the asset may be extended
or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the
estimated life of the asset has changed. The life of leasehold improvements may
change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in
the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the
amount of depreciation recognized in future periods.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2008
and 2007

Net Loss

Regeneron
reported a net loss of $82.7 million, or $1.05 per share (basic and diluted),
for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to a net loss of $105.6 million,
or $1.59 per share (basic and diluted) for 2007. The decrease in net loss was
principally due to revenues earned in 2008 in connection with our November 2007
antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis, partly offset by higher research and
development expenses.

manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies. Recognition of deferred revenue
relates to sanofi-aventis’ up-front aflibercept payments. As of December 31,
2008, $52.4 million of the original $105.0 million of up-front payments related
to aflibercept was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future
periods.

In 2008,
sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron’s antibody expenses consisted of
$72.2 million under the discovery agreement and $25.7 million of development
costs, related primarily to REGN88, under the license agreement, compared to
$3.0 million and $0.7 million respectively, in 2007. Recognition of deferred
revenue under the antibody collaboration related to sanofi-aventis’ $85.0
million up-front payment. As of December 31, 2008, $73.6 million of this
up-front payment was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future
periods.

As
described above, in August 2008, we entered into a separate

VelociGene

agreement
with sanofi-aventis. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $1.2
million in revenue related to this agreement.

The contract research and
development revenue we earn from Bayer HealthCare, as detailed below, consists
partly of cost sharing of Regeneron VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses and
partly of recognition of revenue related to a non-refundable $75.0 million
up-front payment and $20.0 million milestone payment.

For the
period from the collaboration’s inception in October 2006 through September 30,
2007, all up-front licensing, milestone, and cost-sharing payments received or
receivable from Bayer HealthCare had been fully deferred and included in
deferred revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we and Bayer HealthCare
approved a global development plan for VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. The plan
included estimated development steps, timelines, and costs, as well as the
projected responsibilities of each of the companies. In addition, in the fourth
quarter of 2007, we and Bayer HealthCare reaffirmed the companies’ commitment to
a DME development program and had initial estimates of development costs for
VEGF Trap-Eye in DME. As a result, effective in the fourth quarter of 2007, the
Company determined the appropriate accounting policy for payments from Bayer
HealthCare. The $75.0 million up-front licensing payment and the $20.0 million
milestone payment (which was received in August 2007 and not considered
substantive) from Bayer HealthCare are being recognized as contract research and
development revenue


over the related estimated performance
period. In periods when we recognize VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we
incur under the collaboration, we also recognize, as contract research and
development revenue, the portion of those VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses
that is reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In periods when Bayer HealthCare
incurs agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that benefit the
collaboration and Regeneron, we also recognize, as additional research and
development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s VEGF Trap-Eye development
expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we
commenced recognizing previously deferred payments from Bayer HealthCare and
cost-sharing of our and Bayer HealthCare’s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development
expenses through a cumulative catch-up.

Cost-sharing of our VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses with Bayer
HealthCare decreased in 2008 compared to 2007. Under the terms of the
collaboration, in 2008, the first $70.0 million of agreed-upon VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses incurred by Regeneron and Bayer HealthCare under a global
development plan were shared equally, and we were solely responsible for up to
the next $30.0 million. Since both we and Bayer HealthCare incurred higher VEGF
Trap-Eye development expenses in 2008 compared to 2007, during the fourth
quarter of 2008, we were solely responsible for most of the collaboration’s VEGF
Trap-Eye development expenses, which partly contributed to the revenue decrease
in 2008 compared to 2007. In addition, the decrease was due in part to the
cumulative catchup recognized in 2007 from the inception of the collaboration in
October 2006, as described above. Recognition of deferred revenue related to
Bayer HealthCare’s $75.0 million up-front and $20.0 million milestone payments
also decreased in 2008 from 2007 as a result of the cumulative catch-up. As of
December 31, 2008, $66.7 million of the up-front licensing and milestone
payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

Other
contract research and development revenue includes $4.9 million and $5.5
million, respectively, recognized in connection with our five-year grant from
the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIH’s Knockout
Mouse Project.

In
connection with our

VelocImmune

®

license
agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas, each of the $20.0 million annual,
non-refundable payments are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue
ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement. For the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $40.0 million and $28.4 million,
respectively, of technology licensing revenue related to these
agreements.

For the
year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized as revenue $6.3 million of
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) net product
sales for which both the right of return no longer exists and rebates can be
reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2008, deferred revenue related to ARCALYST
net product sales totaled $4.0 million.

Expenses

Total
operating expenses increased to $328.3 million in 2008 from $239.5 million in
2007. Our average headcount in 2008 increased to 810 from 627 in the same period
of 2007 principally as a result of our expanding research and development
activities which are primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with
sanofi-aventis.

Operating
expenses in 2008 and 2007 include a total of $32.5 million and $28.1 million,
respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock option
and restricted stock awards (Non-cash Compensation Expense), as detailed
below:

value of annual employee option grants made in recent years prior to 2006. In
addition, Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2008 and 2007 included $2.2 million
and $0.1 million, respectively, in connection with a December 2007 Restricted
Stock award.

Research and Development
Expenses

Research
and development expenses increased to $278.0 million for the year ended December

____________________

Payroll
and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount, as
described above. Clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs
related to our clinical development programs for (i) VEGF Trap-Eye, which
includes our VIEW 1 trial in wet AMD, (ii) ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept),
which includes our Phase 2 gout flare prevention clinical study, and (iii)
monoclonal antibodies, which includes REGN88 as well as clinical-related
preparatory activities for REGN421. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due
primarily to higher expenses related to VEGF Trap-Eye and monoclonal antibodies,
including REGN88. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in
manufacturing costs associated with ARCALYST and aflibercept. Research and
preclinical development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated
with our antibody programs. Occupancy and other operating costs increased
principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and
development activities, and new operating lease for our Tarrytown, New York
facilities, which commenced in June 2008. Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCare’s
VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in
connection with the VIEW 2 trial in wet AMD, which Bayer HealthCare initiated in
2008.


We budget
our research and development costs by expense category, rather than by project.
We also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in
clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain
costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing
and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under
our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s VEGF
Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates

Drug
development and approval in the United States is a multi-step process regulated
by the FDA. The process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation,
leading up to the submission of an IND to the FDA which, if successful, allows
the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of the potential new
drug. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phase 1, 2,
and 3. The most significant costs in clinical development are in Phase 3
clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug
development process. Following successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials
for a biological product, a biologics license application (or BLA) must be
submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA, and the FDA must approve the BLA prior
to commercialization of the drug. It is not uncommon for the FDA to request
additional data following its review of a BLA, which can significantly increase
the drug development timeline and expenses. We may elect either on our own, or
at the request of the FDA, to conduct further studies that are referred to as
Phase 3B and 4 studies. Phase 3B studies are initiated and either completed or
substantially completed while the BLA is under FDA review. These studies are
conducted under an IND. Phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing
studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the FDA has approved
a product for marketing. In addition, as discovery research, preclinical
development, and clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development
of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. We may elect to add
such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of
our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period
in which we will be developing a product. For example, we, and our
collaborators, where applicable, continue to explore further development of
ARCALYST

, aflibercept, and VEGF Trap-Eye in
different disease indications.

There are
numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties
related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development,
uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials,
changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape
affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in
Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, under “Risks Related to
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) and the
Development of Our Product Candidates,” “Regulatory and Litigation Risks,” and
“Risks Related to Commercialization of Products.” The lengthy process of seeking
FDA approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and
regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us
to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially
adversely affect our business.

For these
reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product
and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated
cost and scope of the projects and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental
approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total
cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we
are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will
generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. In the first quarter of
2008, we received FDA approval for ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, a group
of rare, inherited auto-inflammatory diseases. These rare diseases affect a very
small group of people. As a result, we can not predict whether the
commercialization of ARCALYST in CAPS will result in a significant net cash
benefit to us.


Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses increased to $49.4 million in 2008 from
$37.9 million in the same period of 2007. In 2008, we incurred $5.2 million of
selling expenses related to ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) for the treatment
of CAPS. General and administrative expenses increased in 2008 due to (i) higher
compensation expense primarily resulting from increases in administrative
headcount to support our expanded research and development activities, (ii)
higher recruitment and related costs associated with expanding our headcount,
(iii) higher fees for professional services related to various general corporate
matters, and (iv) higher administrative facility-related costs.

Cost of Goods Sold

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, we began recognizing revenue and cost of goods
sold from net product sales of ARCALYST. We began capitalizing inventory costs
associated with commercial supplies of ARCALYST subsequent to receipt of
marketing approval from the FDA in February 2008. Costs for manufacturing
supplies of ARCALYST prior to receipt of FDA approval were recognized as
research and development expenses in the period that the costs were incurred.
Therefore, these costs are not being included in cost of goods sold when revenue
is recognized from the sale of those supplies of ARCALYST. Cost of goods sold
for 2008 was $0.9 million and consisted primarily of royalties and other period
costs related to ARCALYST commercial supplies.

Other Income and
Expense

Investment income decreased to $18.2 million in 2008 from $20.9 million
in the 2007, due primarily to lower yields on our cash and marketable
securities. In addition, in 2008 and 2007, deterioration in the credit quality
of specific marketable securities in our investment portfolio subjected us to
the risk of not being able to recover these securities’ carrying values. As a
result, in 2008 and 2007, we recognized charges of $2.5 million and $5.9 million
related to securities from three issuers and two issuers, respectively, which we
considered to be other than temporarily impaired. In 2008, these charges were
partially offset by realized gains of $1.2 million on sales of marketable
securities during the year.

Interest
expense of $7.8 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively, was attributable to our 5.5% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due October 17, 2008. During the second and third quarters of
2008, we repurchased a total of $82.5 million in principal amount of these
convertible notes for $83.3 million. In connection with these repurchases, we
recognized a $0.9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, representing the
premium paid on the notes plus related unamortized debt issuance costs. The
remaining $117.5 million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their
maturity in October 2008.

Income Tax
Expense

In the
third quarter of 2008, we implemented a tax planning strategy which resulted in
the utilization of certain net operating loss carry-forwards, that would
otherwise have expired over the next several years, to offset income for tax
purposes. As a result, we incurred and paid income tax expense of $3.1 million,
which relates to U.S. federal and New York State alternative minimum tax and
included $0.2 million of interest and penalties. This expense was partly offset
by a $0.7 million income tax benefit, resulting from a provision in the Housing
Assistance Tax Act of 2008 that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of
our unused pre-2006 research tax credits.

Years Ended December 31, 2007
and 2006

Net Loss

Regeneron
reported a net loss of $105.6 million, or $1.59 per share (basic and diluted),
for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a net loss of $102.3 million,
or $1.77 per share (basic and diluted), for 2006.

Sanofi
aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron’s aflibercept expenses increased in 2007
compared to 2006, primarily due to higher preclinical and clinical development
costs. Recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi-aventis’ up-front
aflibercept payments decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to an extension of the
estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being
recognized. As of December 31, 2007, $61.2 million of the original $105.0
million of up-front payments related to aflibercept was deferred and will be
recognized as revenue in future periods.

In 2007,
sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron’s antibody expenses consisted of $3.0
million under the collaboration’s discovery agreement and $0.7 million of REGN88
development costs under the license agreement. Recognition of deferred revenue
under the antibody collaboration related to sanofi-aventis’ $85.0 million
up-front payment. As of December 31, 2007, $84.1 million of this up-front
payment was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future
periods.

As
described above, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we commenced recognizing
previously deferred payments from Bayer HealthCare and cost-sharing of our and
Bayer HealthCare’s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses through a cumulative
catch-up. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we recognized contract
research and development revenue of $35.9 million, consisting of (i) $15.9
million related to the $75.0 million up-front licensing payment and the $20.0
million milestone payment, and (ii) $20.0 million related to the portion of our
2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable from Bayer
HealthCare. As of December 31, 2007, $79.1 million of the up-front licensing and
milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future
periods.


Other
contract research and development revenue includes $5.5 million and $0.5 million
in 2007 and 2006, respectively, recognized in connection with our five-year
grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIH’s
Knockout Mouse Project.

Contract
manufacturing revenue in 2006 related to our long-term agreement with Merck
& Co., Inc., which expired in October 2006, to manufacture a vaccine
intermediate at our Rensselaer, New York facility. Revenue and the related
manufacturing expense were recognized as product was shipped, after acceptance
by Merck. Included in contract manufacturing revenue in 2006 was $1.2 million of
deferred revenue associated with capital improvement reimbursements paid by
Merck prior to commencement of production. We do not expect to receive any
further contract manufacturing revenue from Merck.

In
connection with our license agreement with AstraZeneca, as described above, the
$20.0 million non-refundable, up-front payment, which we received in February
2007, was deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the twelve month
period beginning in February 2007. In connection with our license agreement with
Astellas, as described above, the $20.0 million non-refundable, up-front
payment, which we received in April 2007, was deferred and recognized as revenue
ratably over the twelve month period beginning in June 2007. For the year ended
December 31, 2007, we recognized $28.4 million of technology licensing revenue
related to these agreements.

Expenses

Total
operating expenses increased to $239.5 million in 2007 from $171.1 million in
2006. Our average employee headcount in 2007 increased to 627 from 573 in 2006,
primarily to support our expanded development programs for VEGF Trap-Eye and
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) and our activities to move our first antibody
candidate (REGN88) into clinical trials. Operating expenses in 2007 and 2006
include a total of $28.1 million and $18.6 million of Non-cash Compensation

____________________

Payroll
and benefits increased primarily due to the increase in employee headcount, as
described above, annual compensation increases effective in 2007, and higher
Non-cash Compensation Expense, as described above. Clinical trial expenses
increased due primarily to higher costs related to our Phase 3 study of VEGF
Trap-Eye in wet AMD, which we initiated in the third quarter of 2007, and our
ongoing Phase 1 and 2 studies of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. Clinical
manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher costs related to
manufacturing ARCALYST

and preclinical and
clinical supplies of REGN88, which were partly offset by lower costs related to
manufacturing aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye. Research and preclinical
development costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to our human
monoclonal antibody programs, including REGN88, and utilization of our
proprietary technology platforms. Occupancy and other operating costs increased
primarily as a result of higher Company headcount and our expanded research and
development activities.

We budget
our research and development costs by expense category, rather than by project.
We also prepare estimates of research and development cost for projects in
clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain
costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing
and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under
our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s VEGF
Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates

$137.1

$64.5


For the
reasons described above in Results of Operations for the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007, under the caption “Research and Development Expenses”, and
due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and the
uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost
and scope of the projects and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental
approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total
cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we
are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will
generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. In the first quarter of
2008, we received FDA approval for ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)

for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare, inherited
auto-inflammatory diseases. These rare diseases affect a very small group of
people. As a result, we can not predict whether the commercialization of
ARCALYST in CAPS will result in a significant net cash benefit to us.

Contract Manufacturing
Expenses

We had no
contract manufacturing expenses in 2007 compared to $8.1 million in 2006, due to
the expiration of our manufacturing agreement with Merck in October
2006.

Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses increased to $37.9 million in 2007 from
$25.9 million in the same period of 2006 primarily due to (i) higher Non-cash
Compensation Expense, as described above, (ii) higher compensation expense
principally due to annual increases effective in 2007 and higher administrative
headcount to support our expanded research and development activities, (iii)
recruitment and related costs associated with expanding our headcount in 2007,
(iv) higher fees for consultants and other professional services on various
corporate matters, and (v) market research and related expenses incurred in 2007
in connection with our ARCALYST

and VEGF Trap-Eye programs.

Other Income and
Expense

Investment income increased to $20.9 million in 2007 from $16.5 million
in 2006, resulting primarily from higher balances of cash and marketable
securities (due, in part, to the up-front payment received from Bayer HealthCare
in October 2006, as described above, and the receipt of net proceeds from the
November 2006 public offering of our Common Stock). This increase was partly
offset by a $5.9 million charge in 2007 related to marketable securities which
we considered to be other than temporarily impaired in value. In the second half
of 2007, deterioration in the credit quality of marketable securities from two
issuers has subjected us to the risk of being unable to recover their full
principal value, which totals $14.0 million. Interest expense was $12.0 million
in 2007 and 2006. Interest expense was attributable primarily to our 5.5%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due October 17, 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our
inception in 1988, we have financed our operations primarily through offerings
of our equity securities, a private placement of convertible debt (which was
repaid in 2008), purchases of our equity securities by our collaborators,
including sanofi-aventis, revenue earned under our past and present research and
development agreements, including our agreements with sanofi-aventis and Bayer
HealthCare, our past contract manufacturing agreements, and our technology
licensing agreements, ARCALYST

product revenue,
and investment income.

Years Ended December 31, 2008 and

At
December 31, 2008, we had $527.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted
cash and marketable securities compared with $846.3 million at December 31,
2007. Under the terms of our non-exclusive license agreements with AstraZeneca
and Astellas, each company made two $20.0 million annual, non-refundable
payments to us, one in 2007 and the other in 2008. In August 2007, we received a
$20.0 million milestone payment from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the
first patient in our Phase 3 study of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. In December
2007, we received an $85.0 million upfront payment in connection with our new
antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Sanofi-aventis also purchased 12
million newly issued, unregistered shares of our Common Stock in December 2007
for gross proceeds to us of $312.0 million.


Cash (Used in) Provided by
Operations

Net cash
used in operations was $89.1 million in 2008, and net cash provided by
operations was $27.4 million in 2007 and $23.1 million in 2006. Our net losses
of $82.7 million in 2008, $105.6 million in 2007, and $102.3 million in 2006
included $32.5 million, $28.1 million, and $18.7 million, respectively, of
Non-cash Compensation Expense. Our net losses also included depreciation and
amortization of $11.3 million, $11.5 million, and $14.6 million in 2008, 2007,
and 2006, respectively.

At
December 31, 2008, accounts receivable increased by $16.9 million, compared to
end-of-year 2007, primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our
antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Also, prepaid expenses and other
assets increased by $6.6 million at December 31, 2008 compared to end-of-year
2007 due to a $12.5 million payment to Cellectis S.A. in July 2008, described
below, which is being amortized in proportion to past and anticipated future
revenues under our license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas and our
antibody discovery agreement with sanofi-aventis. Our deferred revenue balances
at December 31, 2008 decreased by $26.8 million, compared to end-of-year 2007,
primarily due to the amortization of previously received deferred payments under
our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. This decrease was
partly offset by the deferral of $4.0 million of ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)

net product sales at December 31,
2008.

At
December 31, 2007, accounts receivable increased by $10.8 million compared to
end-of-year 2006 due to higher receivable balances related to our collaborations
with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. Also, prepaid expenses and other
assets increased $9.6 million at December 31, 2007 compared to end-of-year 2006
due primarily to higher prepaid clinical trial costs. Our deferred revenue
balances at December 31, 2007 increased by $89.8 million, compared to
end-of-year 2006, due primarily to (i) the $85.0 million up-front payment
received from sanofi-aventis, (ii) the $20.0 million milestone payment from
Bayer HealthCare which was deemed to be non-substantive and fully deferred, and
(iii) the two $20.0 million up-front payments received from each of AstraZeneca
and Astellas, all as described above, partly offset by 2007 revenue recognition,
principally from amortization of these deferred payments and prior year deferred
payments from sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. Accounts payable, accrued
expenses, and other liabilities increased $18.2 million at December 31, 2007
compared to end-of-year 2006, primarily due to a $4.9 million cost-sharing
payment due to Bayer HealthCare in connection with the companies’ VEGF Trap-Eye
collaboration and higher accruals in 2007 for payroll costs and clinical-related
expenses.

At
December 31, 2006, accounts receivable balances decreased by $29.0 million
compared to end-of-year 2005, due to the January 2006 receipt of a $25.0 million
up-front payment from sanofi-aventis, which was receivable at December 31, 2005,
in connection with an amendment to our aflibercept collaboration to include
Japan, and lower amounts due from sanofi aventis for reimbursement of
aflibercept development expenses. Also, our deferred revenue balances at
December 31, 2006 increased by $60.8 million compared to end-of-year 2005, due
primarily to the October 2006 $75.0 million up-front payment from Bayer, as
described above, partly offset by 2006 revenue recognition from deferred
sanofi-aventis up-front payments.

The
majority of our cash expenditures in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were to fund research
and development, primarily related to our clinical programs and, in 2008 and
2007, our preclinical human monoclonal antibody programs. In 2008, 2007, and
2006, we made interest payments totaling $9.3 million, $11.0 million, and $11.0
million, respectively, on our convertible senior subordinated notes.

Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing
Activities

Net cash
provided by investing activities was $30.8 million in 2008, and net cash used in
investing activities was $85.7 million and $155.1 million in 2007 and 2006,
respectively. In 2008, sales or maturities of marketable securities exceeded
purchases by $65.7 million, whereas in 2007 and 2006, purchases of marketable
securities exceeded sales or maturities by $67.3 million and $150.7 million,
respectively. Capital expenditures in 2008 include costs in connection with
expanding our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities and
tenant improvements and related costs in connection with our December 2006
Tarrytown, New York operating lease, as described below. Capital expenditures in
2007 included the purchase of land and a building in Rensselaer for $9.0
million.


Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing
Activities

Net cash
used in financing activities was $192.9 million in 2008, and net cash provided
by financing activities was $319.4 million and $185.4 million in 2007 and 2006,
respectively. In the second and third quarters of 2008, we repurchased $82.5
million in principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes for
$83.3 million. The remaining $117.5 million of convertible notes were repaid in
full upon their maturity in October 2008. In 2007, sanofi-aventis purchased 12
million newly issued, unregistered shares of our Common Stock for gross proceeds
to us of $312.0 million. In 2006, we completed a public offering of 7.6 million
shares of our Common Stock and received proceeds, after expenses, of $174.6
million. In addition, proceeds from issuances of Common Stock in connection with
exercises of employee stock options were $7.9 million in 2008, $7.6 million in
2007, and $10.4 million in 2006.

Fair Value of Marketable
Securities

At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held marketable securities whose aggregate fair
value totaled $278.0 million and $345.7 million, respectively. The composition
of our portfolio of marketable securities on these dates was as
follows:

In
addition, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $249.5 million and $500.6
million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily
held in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities.

During
2008, as marketable securities in our portfolio matured or paid down, we
purchased primarily U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency obligations
and U.S. government-guaranteed debt. This shift toward higher quality securities
reduced the risk profile, as well as the overall yield, of our portfolio during
2008.

In
particular, we reduced the proportion of asset-backed securities in the
portfolio as they deteriorated in credit quality and declined in value due to
higher delinquency rates on the underlying collateral supporting these
securities. Of the $17.8 million of asset-backed securities that we held at
December 31, 2008, $10.0 million were backed by prime and sub-prime residential
mortgages and home equity loans. The remaining $7.8 million were backed by
automotive loans and credit card receivables, of which one $4.9 million security
matured in February 2009. The estimated fair value of our asset-backed
securities generally ranged from 80% to 95% of par value at December 31, 2008.
We purchased these securities in early 2007 when they were all rated triple-A by
at least one of the major rating agencies. In addition, our asset-backed
securities are all senior tranches that are paid-down before other subordinated
tranches as the loans in the underlying collateral are repaid. Through December
31, 2008, we continued to receive monthly payments of principal and interest on
our asset-backed securities holdings. If the monthly principal and interest
payments continue at approximately the current rate, we anticipate that all of
the asset-backed securities in our portfolio will be repaid within the next two
years, and most would be repaid in 2009. However, further deterioration of the
current economic environment and/or higher delinquency rates in the underlying
collateral supporting an asset-backed security in our investment portfolio could
result in future impairment charges related to these securities, which could be
material.

In
addition, we reduced the proportion of corporate bonds in our portfolio from 32%
at December 31, 2007 to 13% at December 31, 2008, due to the deterioration of
the credit quality of many corporate bond issuers. At the end of 2008, we held
$37.1 million of corporate bonds issued by financial services companies, of
which $5.1 million matured in January 2009 and another $21.6 million are
scheduled to mature by the end of 2009. During 2008, we recognized
other-than-temporary impairment charges of $2.5 million related to corporate
securities in our portfolio. Further deterioration in the credit quality of
financial services companies whose debt we hold could result in additional
impairment charges, which could be material.


In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 157,

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We
adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 as of January 1, 2008, for financial
instruments. Although the adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially impact our
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, we are now required
to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements. In
addition, in October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial
Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active,

which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not
active. FSP 157-3 also reaffirms the notion of fair value as an exit price as of
the measurement date. FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance for financial
statements that had not yet been issued. We adopted FSP 157-3 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2008.

SFAS 157
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used
in measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable
inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other
than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly
observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no
market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions. We have determined that the provisions of SFAS 157 are applicable
to our marketable securities, which totaled $278.0 million as of December 31,
2008. At December 31, 2008, less than 1% of our marketable securities
represented Level 3 assets.

Changes in Level 3 marketable
securities during the year ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, there were no transfers of marketable
securities between Level 2 and Level 3 classifications.

Our
methods for valuing our marketable securities are described in Note 2 to our
financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. With respect
to valuations for pricing our Level 2 marketable securities, we consider
quantitative and qualitative factors such as financial conditions and near term
prospects of the issuer, recommendations of the investment advisors and
forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. We also review our investment
advisors’ policies and procedures for valuation and, for a sample of valuations,
review the inputs supporting the valuations and independently test the
valuations through the use of an alternative third-party vendor. For valuations
that we determine for our Level 3 marketable securities, we regularly monitor
these securities and adjust their valuations as deemed appropriate based on the
facts and circumstances.

Collaborations with the
sanofi-aventis Group

Aflibercept

In
September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Aventis
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to sanofi-aventis U.S.) to collaborate on the
development and commercialization of aflibercept in all countries other than
Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize
aflibercept. Sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0
million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our Common
Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, we and
sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration agreement to exclude, from the scope of
the collaboration, the development and commercialization of aflibercept for
intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with this amendment,
sanofi-aventis made a $25.0 million non-refundable payment to us.

In
December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to
expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development
of aflibercept to include Japan. In connection with this amendment,
sanofi-aventis agreed to make a $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to
us, which was


received in January 2006. Under the
collaboration agreement, as amended, we and sanofi-aventis will share
co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of aflibercept outside of
Japan for disease indications included in our collaboration. In Japan, we are
entitled to a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of aflibercept. We
may also receive up to $400 million in milestone payments upon receipt of
specified marketing approvals, including up to $360 million in milestone
payments related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight
aflibercept oncology and other indications in the United States or the European
Union and up to $40 million related to receipt of marketing approvals for up to
five aflibercept oncology indications in Japan.

We have
agreed to manufacture clinical supplies of aflibercept at our plant in
Rensselaer, New York. Sanofi-aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing
commercial scale manufacturing capacity for aflibercept.

Under the
collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide aflibercept
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the
agreement, including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug
supply, will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes
profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these
development expenses, including 50% of the $25.0 million payment received in
connection with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement, in
accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our
share of the collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at
our option. In addition, if the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product
for intraocular delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale of an
aflibercept product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin
reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of aflibercept development
expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial aflibercept
sale under the collaboration occurs. Since inception of the collaboration
agreement through December 31, 2008, we and sanofi-aventis have incurred $446.5
million in agreed upon development expenses related to aflibercept. Currently,
multiple clinical studies to evaluate aflibercept as both a single agent and in
combination with other therapies in various cancer indications are ongoing, and
we and sanofi-aventis plan to initiate additional aflibercept clinical studies
in 2009.

Sanofi-aventis funded $35.6 million, $38.3 million, and $36.4 million,
respectively, of our aflibercept development costs in 2008, 2007, and 2006, of
which $6.3 million, $10.5 million, and $6.8 million, respectively, were included
in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. In addition, the
up-front payments of $80.0 million in September 2003 and $25.0 million in
January 2006 from sanofi-aventis were recorded to deferred revenue and are being
recognized as contract research and development revenue over the period during
which we expect to perform services. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recognized $8.8
million, $8.8 million, and $11.4 million of revenue, respectively, related to
these up-front payments.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause
with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon termination of the agreement
for any reason, any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of
aflibercept development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to
aflibercept.

Antibodies

In
November 2007, we and sanofi-aventis entered into a global, strategic
collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal
antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical
Development Agreement and a License and Collaboration Agreement. We received a
non-refundable up-front payment of $85.0 million from sanofi-aventis under the
discovery agreement. In addition, sanofi-aventis is funding research at
Regeneron to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop
fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. Sanofi-aventis funded
approximately $75 million of research from the collaboration’s inception through
December 31, 2008 and will fund up to $100 million per year in 2009 through
2012. The discovery agreement will expire on December 31, 2012; however,
sanofi-aventis has an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional
three years for further antibody development and preclinical activities.

For each
drug candidate identified under the discovery agreement, sanofi-aventis has the
option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement. If it
elects to do so, sanofi-aventis will co-develop the drug candidate with us
through product approval. Under the license agreement, agreed upon worldwide
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement
will be funded by sanofi-aventis, except that following receipt of the first
positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent
Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (called Shared Phase 3 Trial
Costs) will be shared 80% by sanofi-aventis and 20% by us. If the collaboration
becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of


development expenses that were fully
funded by sanofi-aventis (or half of $27.8 million as of December 31, 2008) and
30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on
the amounts of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from
commercialization of collaboration products. If sanofi-aventis does not exercise
its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the license
agreement, we will retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such
drug candidate, and sanofi-aventis will receive a royalty on sales, if any. The
first three therapeutic antibodies to enter clinical development under the
collaboration are REGN88, that is being evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis,
REGN421, that is being evaluated in oncology in patients with advanced
malignancies, and REGN475, that is being evaluated in pain.

Sanofi-aventis will lead commercialization activities for products
developed under the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such
products. The parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within
the United States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a
sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (sanofi-aventis)/35% (us) and
ending at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us), and losses outside the United States at
55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us). In addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to
receive up to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments
commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales outside the United States
exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.

We are obligated to use commercially
reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under
the collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being
manufactured.

In 2008
and 2007, sanofi-aventis funded $72.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of
our expenses under the collaboration’s discovery agreement and $25.7 million and
$0.7 million, respectively, of our development costs, primarily for REGN88,
under the license agreement. Of these amounts, $25.5 million and $3.7 million
were included in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. In addition, the $85.0 million up-front payment received from
sanofi-aventis in December 2007 was recorded to deferred revenue and is being
recognized as contract research and development revenue over the period during
which we expect to perform services. In 2008 and 2007, we recognized $10.5
million and $0.9 million of revenue, respectively related to this up-front
payment.

In connection with the
collaboration, in August 2008, we entered into a separate agreement with
sanofi-aventis to use our proprietary

VelociGene

®

technology platform to supply sanofi-aventis with genetically
modified mammalian models of gene function and disease. The agreement provides
for minimum annual order quantities for the term of the agreement which extends
through December 2012, for which we expect to receive payments totaling a
minimum of $21.5 million, of which $0.6 million had been received as of December
31, 2008.

With
respect to each antibody product which enters development under the license
agreement, sanofi-aventis or we may, by giving twelve months notice, opt-out of
further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the
other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development and/or
commercialization of the product. We may also opt-out of the further development
of an antibody product if we give notice to sanofi-aventis within thirty days of
the date that sanofi-aventis elects to jointly develop such antibody product
under the license agreement. Each of the discovery agreement and the license
agreement contains other termination provisions, including for material breach
by the other party and, in the case of the discovery agreement, a termination
right for sanofi-aventis under other limited defined circumstances. Prior to
December 31, 2012, sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the discovery
agreement without cause with at least three months advance written notice;
however, except under defined circumstances, sanofi-aventis would be obligated
to immediately pay to us the full amount of unpaid research funding during the
remaining term of the research agreement through December 31, 2012. Upon
termination of the collaboration in its entirety, our obligation to reimburse
sanofi-aventis for development costs out of any future profits from
collaboration products will terminate.

In
December 2007, we sold sanofi-aventis 12 million newly issued, unregistered
shares of Common Stock at an aggregate cash price of $312.0 million, or $26.00
per share of Common Stock. As a condition to the closing of this transaction,
sanofi-aventis entered into an investor agreement with us, which contains
certain demand rights, “standstill provisions”, and other restrictions, which
are more fully described in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.


Collaboration with Bayer
HealthCare

In
October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer
HealthCare to globally develop, and commercialize outside the United States,
VEGF Trap-Eye. Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer HealthCare made a
non-refundable up-front payment to us of $75.0 million. In August 2007, we
received a $20.0 million milestone payment from Bayer HealthCare following
dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 study of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD,
and are eligible to receive up to $90 million in additional development and
regulatory milestones related to the VEGF Trap-Eye program. We are also eligible
to receive up to an additional $135 million in sales milestones if total annual
sales of VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States achieve certain specified
levels starting at $200 million.

We will share equally with Bayer
HealthCare in any future profits arising from the commercialization of VEGF
Trap-Eye outside the United States. If VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing
authorization in a major market country outside the United States and the
collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Bayer
HealthCare out of our share of the collaboration profits for 50% of the agreed
upon development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred (or half of $63.0
million at December 31, 2008) in accordance with a formula based on the amount
of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred and our share of the
collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option. Within the United
States, we are responsible for any future commercialization of VEGF Trap-Eye and
retain exclusive rights to any future profits from commercialization. In 2007,
we initiated the VIEW 1 trial in wet AMD and, in 2008, Bayer HealthCare
initiated the VIEW 2 trial in wet AMD. In addition, in late 2008, we initiated a
Phase 2 study of VEGF Trap-Eye in patients with DME. We are also obligated to
use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial product
requirements.

The $75.0
million up-front payment and $20.0 million non-substantive milestone payment
from Bayer HealthCare were recorded to deferred revenue. In 2008 and 2007, we
recognized $12.4 million and $15.9 million, respectively, of revenue related to
these deferred payments. We did not recognize revenue in connection with our
collaboration with Bayer HealthCare in 2006.

Under the
terms of the agreement, in 2009 and thereafter, all agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses incurred by both companies under a global development plan
will be shared equally. In 2008, the first $70.0 million of VEGF Trap-Eye
development expenses were shared equally and we were solely responsible for up
to the next $30.0 million, which resulted in a net payment of $11.3 million to
Bayer HealthCare by us in 2008. In 2007, the first $50.0 million of VEGF
Trap-Eye development expenses were shared equally and we were solely responsible
for up to the next $40.0 million, which resulted in a net reimbursement of $9.4
million from Bayer HealthCare to us in 2007. Neither party was reimbursed for
any development expenses that it incurred prior to 2007. At December 31, 2008
and 2007, accrued expenses included $9.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively,
due to Bayer HealthCare. In addition, at December 31, 2007, accounts receivable
included $2.8 million due from Bayer HealthCare.

Bayer
HealthCare has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least
six months or twelve months advance notice depending on defined circumstances at
the time of termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for any
reason, we retain all rights to VEGF Trap-Eye.

License Agreements with
AstraZeneca and Astellas

Under
these non-exclusive license agreements, AstraZeneca and Astellas each made two
$20.0 million annual, non-refundable payments to us, one in 2007 and the other
in 2008. AstraZeneca and Astellas are each required to make up to four
additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to each licensee’s ability
to terminate its license agreement with us after making two more payments or
earlier if the technology does not meet minimum performance criteria.

National Institutes of Health
Grant

Under our
five-year grant from the NIH, we are entitled to receive a minimum of $24.5
million over a five-year period, subject to compliance with the grant’s terms
and annual funding approvals, including $1.5 million to optimize our existing
C57BL/6 ES cell line and its proprietary growth medium. In 2008 and 2007, we
recognized $4.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of revenue related to
the NIH Grant, of which $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, was
receivable at the end of 2008 and 2007. In 2009, we expect to receive funding of
approximately $5 million for reimbursement of Regeneron expenses related to the
NIH Grant.


Convertible Debt

In 2001,
we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior
subordinated notes, which bore interest at 5.5% per annum, payable
semi-annually, and that matured in October 2008. During the second and third
quarters of 2008, we repurchased $82.5 million in principal amount of our notes
for $83.3 million. The remaining $117.5 million of outstanding convertible notes
were repaid in full upon their maturity in October 2008.

License Agreement with
Cellectis

In July
2008, we and Cellectis S.A. entered into an Amended and Restated Non-Exclusive
License Agreement. The amended license agreement resolved a dispute between the
parties related to the interpretation of a license agreement entered into by the
parties in December 2003 pursuant to which we licensed certain patents and
patent applications relating to a process for the specific replacement of a copy
of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous recombination. Pursuant to the
amended license agreement, in July 2008, we made a non-refundable $12.5 million
payment to Cellectis and agreed to pay Cellectis a low single-digit royalty
based on revenue received by us from any future licenses or sales of our

VelociGene

®

or

VelocImmune

®

products and services. No royalties are payable with respect
to our

VelocImmune

license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas or our November 2007
collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Moreover, no royalties are payable on any
revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from our

VelocImmune

technology.

We are
amortizing our $12.5 million payment to Cellectis in proportion to past and
anticipated future revenues under our license agreements with AstraZeneca and
Astellas and our antibody discovery agreement with sanofi-aventis. In 2008, we
recognized $2.7 million of expense related to this agreement.

In July
2008, we and Cellectis also entered into a Subscription Agreement pursuant to
which we purchased 368,301 ordinary shares of Cellectis in November 2008 at a
price of EUR 8.63 per share (which was equivalent to $10.98 at the EUR exchange
rate on the date of purchase).

Operating Lease – Tarrytown, New
York Facilities

Under our
main operating lease, as amended, we currently lease approximately 248,000
square feet of laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York. In
December 2006, we entered into a new operating lease agreement (as amended in
October 2007) to lease approximately 257,000 square feet of laboratory and
office space at our current Tarrytown location, which included approximately
27,000 square feet that we currently occupy (our retained facilities) and
approximately 230,000 square feet in new facilities that are currently under
construction and expected to be completed in mid-2009. In September 2008, we
amended the operating lease agreement to increase the amount of retained space
we will lease from approximately 27,000 square feet to approximately 118,000
square feet, for an amended total under the new lease of approximately 348,000
square feet. The term of the new lease commenced effective June 2008 and will
expire in June 2024. Under the new lease we also have various options and rights
on additional space at the Tarrytown site, and will continue to lease our
present facilities until the new facilities are ready for occupancy. In
addition, the lease contains three renewal options to extend the term of the
lease by five years each and early termination options for our retained
facilities only. The lease provides for monthly payments over the term of the
lease related to our retained facilities, the costs of construction and tenant
improvements for our new facilities, and additional charges for utilities,
taxes, and operating expenses.

In
connection with the new lease agreement, in December 2006, we issued a letter of
credit in the amount of $1.6 million to our landlord, which is collateralized by
a $1.6 million bank certificate of deposit.

Capital
Expenditures

Our
additions to property, plant, and equipment totaled $34.9 million in 2008, $19.6
million in 2007, and $3.3 million in 2006. In 2009, we expect to incur
approximately $50 to $60 million in capital expenditures (net of Tarrytown
tenant improvement costs that will be reimbursed by our landlord in connection
with our new operating lease), primarily in connection with expanding our
manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities and our new
Tarrytown operating lease, as described above. We currently expect to incur
approximately $30 million in capital expenditures in 2010.


Funding
Requirements

Our total
expenses for research and development from inception through December 31, 2008
have been approximately $1,630 million. We have entered into various agreements
related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and
utilize our technology platforms, including collaboration agreements, such as
those with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare, and agreements to use our

Velocigene

®

technology platform. We
incurred expenses associated with these agreements, which include an allocable
portion of general and administrative costs, of $230.6 million, $108.2 million,
and $43.4 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

We expect
to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and
development activities (including preclinical and clinical testing). Before
taking into account reimbursements from collaborators, we currently anticipate
that approximately 50-60% of our expenditures for 2009 will be directed toward
the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates, including
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept), aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and monoclonal antibodies
(including REGN88, REGN421, and REGN475); approximately 25-30% of our
expenditures for 2009 will be applied to our basic research and early
preclinical activities and the remainder of our expenditures for 2009 will be
used for the continued development of our novel technology platforms, capital
expenditures, and general corporate purposes.

We
currently anticipate that in 2009 the commercialization of
ARCALYST

for the treatment of CAPS will not materially enhance or otherwise
materially impact our cash flows.

In
connection with our funding requirements, the following table summarizes our
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008. These obligations and
commitments assume non-termination of agreements and represent expected payments
based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:

      related to our new operating lease for facilities under construction in
      Tarrytown, New York, as described above. Excludes future contingent rental
      costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. In 2008,
      these costs were $8.4 million.

(2)

Purchase obligations primarily
      relate to (i) research and development commitments, including those
      related to clinical trials, (ii) capital expenditures for equipment
      acquisitions, and (iii) license payments. Our obligation to pay certain of
      these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events.
      Open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the
      ordinary course of business are excluded from the table
    above.

Under our
collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, over the next several years we and Bayer
HealthCare will share agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred by
both companies, under a global development plan, as described above. In
addition, under our collaboration agreements with sanofi-aventis and Bayer
HealthCare, if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable, we have
contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi-aventis and Bayer
HealthCare for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development
expenses incurred by sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare, respectively.
Profitability under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net sales
less agreed-upon expenses. These reimbursements would be deducted from our share
of the collaboration profits (and, for our aflibercept collaboration with
sanofi-aventis, royalties on product sales in Japan) otherwise payable to us
unless we agree to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate at our option.
Given the uncertainties related to drug development (including the development
of aflibercept and co-developed antibody candidates in collaboration with
sanofi-aventis and VEGF Trap-Eye in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare) such


as the variability in the length of
time necessary to develop a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain
governmental approval for commercialization, we are currently unable to reliably
estimate if our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare will
become profitable.

The
amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors, including the
status of competitive products, the success of our research and development
programs, the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff
and facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual property rights,
the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug
candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations with
sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. Clinical trial costs are dependent, among
other things, on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for services
provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for
manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies,
laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of funding that will be
required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and
preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements,
the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical
trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost
of each trial as described above. Currently, we are required to remit royalties
on product sales of ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) for the treatment of CAPS. In the
future, if we are able to successfully develop, market, and sell ARCALYST for
other indications or certain of our product candidates, we may be required to
pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in
connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements.

We expect
that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of
patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as
a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the United States and foreign
countries.

We
believe that our existing capital resources, including funding we are entitled
to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet operating
needs through at least 2012. However, this is a forward-looking statement based
on our current operating plan, and there may be a change in projected revenues
or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before
such time. If there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned
operations and activities, we believe we would prioritize available capital to
fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.

Other
than letters of credit totaling $1.7 million, including a $1.6 million letter of
credit issued to our landlord in connection with our operating lease for
facilities in Tarrytown, New York, as described above, we have no off-balance
sheet arrangements. In addition, we do not guarantee the obligations of any
other entity. As of December 31, 2008, we had no established banking
arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing or a line of
credit. In the event we need additional financing for the operation of our
business, we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or
private financing, including additional equity financing. Factors influencing
the availability of additional financing include our progress in product
development, investor perception of our prospects, and the general condition of
the financial markets. We may not be able to secure the necessary funding
through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private
offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital
requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain of our
research and development activities or future operations. This could materially
harm our business.

Future Impact of Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In
November 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Statement No. 07-1,

Accounting for Collaborative
Arrangements

(EITF 07-1). EITF 07-01 defines
collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for
transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between
participants in the arrangement and third parties. EITF 07-1 also establishes
the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint
operating activities and payments between participants, as well as the
sufficiency of the disclosures related to these arrangements. EITF 07-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will be
applied retrospectively as a change in accounting principle for collaborative
arrangements existing at the effective date. We are required to adopt EITF 07-1
for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. Our management does not
anticipate that the adoption of EITF 07-1 will have a material impact on our
financial statements.

In March
2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161,

Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an Amendment of FASB
Statement 133

. SFAS 161 enhances required
disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced
disclosures regarding how (a) an entity uses derivative instruments, (b)
derivative


instruments and related hedged items
are accounted for under SFAS 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and (c) derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is
effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15,
2008. We are required to adopt SFAS 161 for the fiscal year beginning January 1,
2009. Our management does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 161 will have
a material impact on our financial statements.

In April
2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets

. This FSP amends the factors that
should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.

The intent of this FSP is to improve
the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of
the asset under SFAS 141R, and other generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP). This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We are required to adopt FSP FAS 142-3 for
the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. Our management does not anticipate
that the adoption of this FSP will have a material impact on our financial
statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our
earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest
rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in U.S.
government, corporate, and asset-backed securities. We do not believe we are
materially exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our current policies, we
do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest
rate changes. We estimated that a one percent unfavorable change in interest
rates would result in approximately a $1.9 million decrease in the fair value of
our investment portfolio at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Credit Quality Risk

We have
an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment
securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and
diversification. Nonetheless, deterioration of the credit quality of an
investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not
being able to recover the full principal value of the security. In the second
half of 2007, we recognized a $5.9 million charge related to marketable
securities from two issuers which we considered to be other than temporarily
impaired in value. In 2008, an additional $0.7 million impairment charge was
recognized related to one of these securities and a $1.8 million charge was
recognized related to another marketable security which we considered to be
other than temporarily impaired in value.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures

The
Company’s management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer each concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that


it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, and is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the
Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the
framework in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation
our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2008. The effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears herein.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

There has
been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the
quarter ended December 31, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls
over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met and cannot
detect all deviations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud or deviations, if any, within the company
have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

In our
opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December
31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
based on criteria established in

Internal
Control

- Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

As
discussed in note 2 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the
Company changed its method of accounting for share-based payment, to conform
with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-based Payment.”

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(Unless otherwise noted,
dollars in thousands, except per share data)

1. Organization and
Business

Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or “Regeneron”) was incorporated in January
1988 in the State of New York. The Company is engaged in the research,
development, and commercialization of therapeutics to treat human disorders and
conditions. In 2008, the Company received marketing approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the Company’s first commercial drug product,
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) Injection for Subcutaneous Use for the
treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (“CAPS”). The Company’s
facilities are primarily located in New York. The Company’s business is subject
to certain risks including, but not limited to, uncertainties relating to
conducting pharmaceutical research, obtaining regulatory approvals,
commercializing products, and obtaining and enforcing patents.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows and the balance sheet, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported in the
balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair
value.

Marketable
Securities

The
Company has an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable
investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and
concentration and diversification. The Company generally invests its excess cash
in obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, investment grade debt
securities issued by corporations, governments, and financial institutions, bank
deposits, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, and money market funds that
invest in these instruments. The Company considers its marketable securities to
be “available-for-sale,” as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. (“SFAS”) 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

These assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and
losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. If the decline in the value of a
marketable security in the Company’s investment portfolio is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the security to its current fair
value and recognizes a loss that is charged against income. As described under
“Use of Estimates” below, on a quarterly basis, the Company reviews its
portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative and qualitative
factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are
other-than-temporary.

Capitalization of Inventory
Costs

The
Company does not capitalize inventory costs associated with commercial supplies
of drug product until it has received marketing approval from the FDA. Prior to
receipt of FDA approval, costs for manufacturing supplies of drug product are
recognized as research and development expenses in the period that the costs
were incurred. Therefore, these pre-approval manufacturing costs are not
included in cost of goods sold when revenue is recognized from the sale of those
supplies of drug product.

In
February 2008, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA for
ARCALYST

for the treatment of CAPS. In 2008, subsequent to receipt of such
marketing approval, ARCALYST shipments to the Company’s customers consisted of
supplies of inventory manufactured and expensed prior to FDA approval. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had no inventoried costs related to
ARCALYST.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
data)

Property, Plant, and
Equipment

Property,
plant, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not
materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as
incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets
retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss
is recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of property, plant, and
equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

7-30
      years

Laboratory and other
      equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

      years

Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the
assets or the lease term, without assuming renewal features, if any, are
exercised. Costs of construction of certain long-lived assets include
capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the
related asset.

Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

The
Company periodically assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets, such as
property, plant, and equipment, and evaluates such assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is determined to exist if
estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount in
accordance with SFAS 144,

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

For all periods presented, no impairment losses were recorded.

Patents

As a
result of the Company’s research and development efforts, the Company has
obtained, applied for, or is applying for, a number of patents to protect
proprietary technology and inventions. All costs associated with patents are
expensed as incurred.

Leases

The
Company accounts for its lease agreements pursuant to SFAS 13,

Accounting for Leases.

On
certain of its lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other
incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis without
regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays that defer the
commencement date of required payments. In addition, lease incentives that the
Company receives are treated as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the
related agreements.

Revenue
Recognition

a. Contract Research and Development
Revenue

The
Company recognizes contract research and development revenue and research
progress payments in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (“SAB”) 104,

Revenue Recognition

and Emerging Issues Task Force No. (“EITF”) 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.

The Company earns contract
research and development revenue and research progress payments in connection
with collaboration and other agreements to develop and commercialize product
candidates and utilize the Company’s technology platforms. The terms of these
agreements typically include non-refundable up-front licensing payments,
research progress (milestone) payments, and payments for development activities.
Non-refundable up-front license payments, where continuing involvement is
required of the Company, are deferred and recognized over the related
performance period. The Company estimates its performance period based on the
specific terms of each agreement, and adjusts the performance periods, if
appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances. Payments which are
based on achieving a specific performance milestone, involving a degree of risk,
are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment
is due and non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

For the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
data)

associated with that milestone.
Substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements
in the development life-cycle of the related product candidate, such as
completion of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies, and
receipt of approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a payment is
deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, the Company takes into
consideration (i) the nature, timing, and value of significant achievements in
the development life-cycle of the related development product candidate, (ii)
the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, and (iii) the
relative level of risk in achieving the milestone, taking into account the high
degree of uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a drug
development program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product.
Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are
accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance
period.

The
Company enters into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements
regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development
activities. The Company may share the costs of research and development
activities with a collaborator, such as in the Company’s VEGF Trap-Eye
collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC, or the Company may be reimbursed for
all or a significant portion of the costs of the Company’s research and
development activities, such as in the Company’s aflibercept and antibody
collaborations with the sanofi-aventis Group. The Company records its internal
and third-party development costs associated with these collaborations as
research and development expenses. When the Company is entitled to reimbursement
of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that it incurs
under a collaboration, the Company records those reimbursable amounts as
contract research and development revenue proportionately as the Company
recognizes its expenses. If the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in
which both the Company and its collaborator perform development work and share
costs, in periods when the Company’s collaborator incurs development expenses
that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, the Company also recognizes, as
additional research and development expense, the portion of the collaborator’s
development expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse. In addition,
the Company records revenue in connection with a government research grant using
a proportional performance model as it incurs expenses related to the grant,
subject to the grant’s terms and annual funding approvals.

In
connection with non-refundable licensing payments, the Company’s performance
period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress,
and results of its research and development activities. Due to the variability
in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug
product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in
the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization,
revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and
could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year
in the future. In addition, estimated performance periods may change if
development programs encounter delays or the Company and its collaborators
decide to expand or contract the clinical plans for a drug candidate in various
disease indications. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2007, the
Company recognized $2.6 million less in contract research and development
revenue, compared to amounts recognized in 2006, in connection with
non-refundable up-front payments previously received from sanofi-aventis
pursuant to the companies’ aflibercept collaboration, due to an extension of the
Company’s estimated performance period. In addition, during the fourth quarter
of 2008, the Company extended its estimated performance period in connection
with the up-front and milestone payments previously received from Bayer
HealthCare pursuant to the companies’ VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration and shortened
its estimated performance period in connection with up-front payments from
sanofi-aventis pursuant to the companies’ aflibercept collaboration. The net
effect of these changes in the Company’s estimates resulted in the recognition
of $0.4 million less in contract research and development revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2008, compared to amounts recognized in connection with these
deferred payments in each of the prior three quarters of 2008. Also, if a
collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the
agreement, the Company would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up-front
or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination.

b. Contract Manufacturing

The
Company manufactured product and performed services for a third party under a
contract manufacturing agreement which expired in October 2006. Contract
manufacturing revenue was recognized as product was shipped and as services were
performed.

c.

VelocImmune

®

Technology
Licensing

The
Company enters into non-exclusive license agreements with third parties that
allow the third party to utilize the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology in its internal
research programs. The terms of these agreements include annual, non-refundable
payments and entitle the Company to receive royalties on any future sales of
products discovered by the third party using the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology.
Annual, non-refundable payments under these agreements, where continuing
involvement is required of the Company, are deferred and recognized ratably over
their respective annual license periods.

d. Product Revenue

In
February 2008, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA for
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) for the treatment of CAPS. The Company recognizes revenue
from product sales in accordance with SAB 104. Revenue from product sales is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product
and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or
determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, and the
Company has no further performance obligations. Revenue and deferred revenue
from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay
discounts, product returns, estimated rebates payable under governmental
programs (including Medicaid), distribution fees, and other sales-related costs.
The Company accounts for these reductions in accordance with EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Considerations Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products),

and SFAS 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists,

as applicable. In accordance with
EITF 01-9 and SFAS 48, since the Company currently has limited historical return
and rebate experience for ARCALYST, product sales revenues are deferred until
(i) the right of return no longer exists or the Company can reasonably estimate
returns and (ii) rebates have been processed or the Company can reasonably
estimate rebates. The Company reviews its estimates of rebates payable each
period and records any necessary adjustments in the current period’s net product
sales.

Investment
Income

Interest income, which is included
in investment income, is recognized as earned.

Research and Development
Expenses

Research
and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of
research and development programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll
taxes, employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance
of research equipment, costs related to research collaboration and licensing
agreements, the cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
services related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical trial expenses, the
full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development,
and clinical trials, amounts that the Company is obligated to reimburse to
collaborators for research and development expenses that they incur, and the
allocable portions of facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance,
repairs and maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All costs
associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.

Clinical
trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and
include costs associated with third-party contractors. The Company outsources a
substantial portion of its clinical trial activities, utilizing external
entities such as contract research organizations, independent clinical
investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist the Company
with the execution of its clinical studies. For each clinical trial that the
Company conducts, certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while
others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in
the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and the period over which
clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to
provide services.

Clinical
activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative
functions to manage the Company’s clinical trials are performed primarily by
contract research organizations (“CROs”). CROs typically perform most of the
start-up activities for the Company’s trials, including document preparation,
site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and
program management. On a budgeted basis, these startup costs are typically 10%
to 20% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range
can be

significantly wider, as many of the
Company’s contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the
original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change
materially. These start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the
contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. The remaining
activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration,
generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study.
In the event of early termination of a clinical trial, the Company accrues and
recognizes expenses in an amount based on its estimate of the remaining
non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical
trial and/or penalties.

For
clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient
basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, the Company accrues on
an estimated cost-per-patient basis an expense based on subject enrollment and
activity in each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in a
quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the
study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required
level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and
drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study.
Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically
those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of
patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years.
During the course of a trial, the Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense
recognition if actual results differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s
estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ
significantly from its actual results, which could cause material increases or
decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual
results become known.

Stock-based Employee Compensation

Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment,

which is a revision of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an
entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions, and
requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair
value of the share-based payment (including stock options and restricted stock)
issued to employees. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate, at the time of
grant, the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited and to revise this
estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. Effective January 1, 2005 and prior to the Company’s adoption
of SFAS 123R, the Company recognized the effect of forfeitures in stock-based
compensation cost in the period when they occurred, in accordance with SFAS 123.
Upon adoption of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, the Company was required
to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the effect of estimated
forfeitures related to outstanding awards that were not expected to vest as of
the SFAS 123R adoption date. This adjustment reduced the Company’s loss by $0.8
million and is included in the Company’s operating results in 2006 as a
cumulative-effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle.

Income Taxes

The
Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts (“temporary
differences”) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for
deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain.

Comprehensive Income
(Loss)

The
Company presents comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with SFAS 130,

Reporting Comprehensive
Income.

Comprehensive income (loss) of the
Company includes net income (loss) adjusted for the change in net unrealized
gain or loss on marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
comprehensive income (loss) is immaterial. Comprehensive losses for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 have been included in the Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity.

Concentration of Credit
Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities (see Note 3), and
receivables from sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare (see Note 4).

Per Share Data

Net
income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is computed on the basis of the net
income (loss) for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares of
Common Stock and Class A Stock outstanding during the period. Basic net income
(loss) per share excludes restricted stock awards until vested. Diluted net
income per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares of Common
Stock and Class A Stock outstanding, and of common stock equivalents outstanding
when dilutive. Common stock equivalents include: (i) outstanding stock options
and restricted stock awards under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plans, which
are included under the “treasury stock method” when dilutive, and (ii) Common
Stock to be issued under the assumed conversion of the Company’s formerly
outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes, which are included under the
“if-converted method” when dilutive. The computation of diluted net loss per
share for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 does not include
common stock equivalents, since such inclusion would be antidilutive.

Risks and
Uncertainties

Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and
expense. Since its inception, the Company has not generated any significant
sales or profits from the commercialization of ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept)
or any of the Company’s other product candidates. Before revenues from the
commercialization of the Company’s current or future product candidates can be
realized, the Company (or its collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles
which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining
regulatory approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries.
In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly
evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render the Company’s
products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. The Company may be subject
to legal claims by third parties seeking to enforce patents to limit or prohibit
the Company from marketing or selling its products. The Company is also
dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants, collaborators, and
certain third-party suppliers, including single-source unaffiliated third-party
suppliers of certain raw materials and equipment. Regeneron, as licensee,
licenses certain technologies that are important to the Company’s business which
impose various obligations on the Company. If Regeneron fails to comply with
these requirements, licensors may have the right to terminate the Company’s
licenses.

The
Company has generally incurred net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since its inception. Revenues to date have principally been limited
to (i) up-front, license, milestone, and reimbursement payments from the
Company’s collaborators and other entities related to the Company’s development
activities and technology platforms, (ii) payments for past contract
manufacturing activities, (iii) ARCALYST

product sales, and (iv) investment income.
Contract research and development revenue in 2008 was primarily earned from
sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare under collaboration agreements (see Note 10
for the terms of these agreements). These collaboration agreements contain early
termination provisions that are exercisable by sanofi-aventis or Bayer
HealthCare, as applicable.

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates which could have a
significant impact on the Company’s financial statements include:

Periods over which payments, including
  non-refundable up-front, license, and milestone payments, are

recognized as revenue in connection with collaboration and
  other agreements to develop and commercialize

product candidates and utilize the Company’s technology
  platforms.

The Company’s determination of whether marketable
  securities are other than temporarily impaired. The

Company conducts a quarterly review of its portfolio of marketable
  securities, using both quantitative and

qualitative factors, to determine, for securities whose current fair
  value is less than their cost, whether

the
  decline in fair value below cost is other-than-temporary. In making this
  determination, the Company

considers factors
  such as the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less
  than cost,

financial condition and near-term
  prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and

forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends.
  This review process also includes an evaluation of

the Company’s ability and intent to hold individual securities until
  they mature or their full value can be

recovered. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of
  judgment.

Future Impact of Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In
November 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Statement No. 07-1,

Accounting for Collaborative
Arrangements

(“EITF 07-1”). EITF 07-01
defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for
transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between
participants in the arrangement and third parties. EITF 07-1 also establishes
the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint
operating activities and payments between participants, as well as the
sufficiency of the disclosures related to these arrangements. EITF 07-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will be
applied retrospectively as a change in accounting principle for collaborative
arrangements existing at the effective date. The Company is required to adopt
EITF 07-1 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. Management does not
anticipate that the adoption of EITF 07-1 will have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

In March
2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an
Amendment of FASB Statement 133.

SFAS 161 enhances required disclosures
regarding derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced disclosures
regarding how (a) an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

and (c)
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company
is required to adopt SFAS 161 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009.
Management does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 161 will have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In April
2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets.

This FSP amends the factors that
should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.

The intent of this FSP is to improve
the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of
the asset

Realized
gains and losses are included as a component of investment income. For the year
ended December 31, 2008, realized gains on sales of marketable securities
totaled $1.2 million and realized losses on sales of marketable securities were
not significant. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, realized gains
and losses on sales of marketable securities were not significant. In computing
realized gains and losses, the Company computes the cost of its investments on a
specific identification basis. Such cost includes the direct costs to acquire
the security, adjusted for the amortization of any discount or premium.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,

Fair
Value Measurements.

SFAS 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 157 for financial instruments as of January 1, 2008. Although the adoption
of SFAS 157 did not materially impact the Company’s financial condition, results
of operations, or cash flows, the Company is now required to provide additional
disclosures as part of its financial statements. In addition, in October 2008,
the FASB issued FSP 157-3,

Determining the
Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active,

which clarifies the application of SFAS 157
in a market that is not active. FSP 157-3 also reaffirms the notion of fair
value as an exit price as of the measurement date. FSP 157-3 was effective upon
issuance for financial statements that had not yet been issued and adopted by
the Company for the year ended December 31, 2008.

SFAS 157
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used
in measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable
inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other
than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly
observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no
market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.

Marketable securities included in Level 2 above were valued using a
market approach utilizing prices and other relevant information generated by
market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, deterioration in the credit quality of a marketable
security from one issuer subjected the Company to the risk of not being able to
recover the security’s principal value. As a result, the Company recognized a
$1.8 million charge related to this Level 2 marketable security, which the
Company considered to be other than temporarily impaired.

Marketable securities included in Level 3 above were valued using
information provided by the Company’s investment advisors, including quoted bid
prices which take into consideration the securities’ current lack of liquidity.
During the year ended December 31, 2007, deterioration in the credit quality of
marketable securities from two issuers subjected the Company to the risk of not
being able to recover the full principal value of these securities. As a result,
the Company recognized a $5.9 million charge related to these marketable
securities, which the Company considered to be other than temporarily impaired.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized an additional
$0.7 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to one of these
marketable securities.

Changes
in marketable securities included in Level 3 above during the twelve month
period ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:

There
were no unrealized gains or losses related to the Company’s Level 3 marketable
securities for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, there were no
purchases of Level 3 marketable securities and no transfers of marketable
securities between the Level 2 and Level 3 classifications during the
period.

As
described in Note 2 above under “Use of Estimates”, on a quarterly basis, the
Company reviews its portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative
and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are
other-than-temporary. As a result of these quarterly reviews, in 2008 and 2007,
the Company recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of its
marketable securities totaling $2.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively, as
described above, which are included as a component of investment income.
However, the current economic environment, the deterioration in the credit
quality of some of the issuers of securities that the Company holds, and the
recent volatility of securities markets increase the risk that there could be
further declines in the market value of marketable securities in the Company’s
investment portfolio and that such declines could result in additional charges
against income in future periods for other-than-temporary impairments, and such
amounts could be material.

Equity

The
Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for the issuance of up
to 40 million shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 160
million shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share. Shares of Class A
Stock are convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into shares of
Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class A Stock have rights
and privileges identical to Common Stockholders except that each share of Class
A is entitled to ten votes per share, while each share of Common Stock is
entitled to one vote per share. Class A Stock may only be transferred to
specified Permitted Transferees, as defined. Under the Company’s Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) is
authorized to issue up to 30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined by the
Board.

In
November 2006, the Company completed a public offering of 7.6 million shares of
Common Stock at a price of $23.03 per share and received proceeds, after
expenses, of $174.6 million.

In
September 2003, sanofi-aventis purchased 2,799,552 newly issued, unregistered
shares of the Company’s Common Stock for $45.0 million. See Note 10.

In
December 2007, sanofi-aventis purchased 12 million newly issued, unregistered
shares of the Company’s Common Stock for an aggregate cash price of $312.0
million. As a condition to the closing of this transaction, sanofi-aventis
entered into an investor agreement with the Company. Under the investor
agreement, sanofi-aventis has three demand rights to require the Company to use
all reasonable efforts to conduct a registered underwritten public offering with
respect to shares of the Company’s Common Stock beneficially owned by
sanofi-aventis immediately after the closing of the transaction. Until the later
of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the
License and Collaboration Agreement under the Company’s antibody collaboration
with sanofi-aventis (see Note 10) and the Company’s collaboration agreement with
sanofi-aventis for the development and commercialization of aflibercept (see
Note 10), sanofi-aventis will be bound by certain “standstill” provisions. These
provisions include an agreement not to acquire more than a specified percentage
of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A Stock and Common Stock. The
percentage is currently 25% and will increase to 30% after December 20, 2011.
Sanofi-aventis has also agreed not to dispose of any shares of the Company’s
Common Stock that were beneficially owned by sanofi-aventis immediately after
the closing of the transaction until December 20, 2012, subject to certain
limited exceptions. Following December 20, 2012, sanofi-aventis will be
permitted to sell shares of the Company’s Common Stock (i) in a registered
underwritten public offering undertaken pursuant to the demand registration
rights granted to sanofi-aventis and described above, subject to the
underwriter’s broad distribution of securities sold, (ii) pursuant to Rule 144
under the Securities Act and transactions exempt from registration under the
Securities Act, subject to a volume limitation of one million shares of the
Company’s Common Stock every three months and a prohibition on selling to
beneficial owners, or persons that would become beneficial owners as a result of
such sale, of 5% or

more of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s Common Stock, and (iii) into an issuer tender offer, or a tender offer
by a third party that is recommended or not opposed by the Company’s Board of
Directors. Sanofi-aventis has agreed to vote, and cause its affiliates to vote,
all shares of the Company’s voting securities they are entitled to vote, at
sanofi-aventis’ election, either as recommended by the Company’s Board of
Directors or proportionally with the votes cast by the Company’s other
shareholders, except with respect to certain change of control transactions,
liquidation or dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding 10% of the
then outstanding shares or voting rights of the Company’s Class A Stock and
Common Stock, and new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially
consistent with the Company’s historical equity compensation practices. The
rights and restrictions under the investor agreement are subject to termination
upon the occurrence of certain events.

9. Commitments and
Contingencies

a. Operating
Leases

The
Company currently leases laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York
under operating lease agreements. In December 2006, the Company entered into a
new operating lease agreement to lease laboratory and office space that is now
under construction and expected to be completed in mid-2009 at the Company’s
current Tarrytown location, plus retain a portion of the Company’s existing
space. In October 2007 and September 2008, the Company amended the December 2006
operating lease agreement to increase the amount of new and existing space to be
leased. The term of the lease commenced effective June 30, 2008 and will expire
in June 2024. Under the new lease the Company also has various options and
rights on additional space at the Tarrytown site, and will continue to lease its
present facilities until the new facilities are ready for occupancy. In
addition, the lease contains three renewal options to extend the term of the
lease by five years each and early termination options for the Company’s
retained facilities only. The lease provides for monthly payments over the term
of the lease related to the Company’s retained facilities, the costs of
construction and tenant improvements for the Company’s new facilities, and
additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.

In
connection with the new lease agreement, in December 2006, the Company issued a
letter of credit in the amount of $1.6 million to its landlord, which is
collateralized by a $1.6 million bank certificate of deposit. The certificate of
deposit has been classified as restricted cash at December 31, 2008 and
2007.

In
November 2007, the Company entered into a new operating sublease for additional
office space in Tarrytown, New York. The lease expires in September 2009 and
contains two renewal options to extend the term of the sublease by three months
each. In April 2008, the Company entered into a new operating sublease for
additional office space located in Tarrytown, New York. The lease expires in
March 2010 and contains one renewal option to extend the term of the sublease by
six months. In October 2008 the Company entered into a new sublease with
sanofi-aventis U.S. Inc. for office space in Bridgewater, New Jersey. The lease
commences in January 2009 and expires in July 2011.

The
Company formerly leased manufacturing, office, and warehouse facilities in
Rensselaer, New York under an operating lease agreement. The lease provided for
base rent plus additional rental charges for utilities, taxes, and operating
expenses, as defined. In June 2007, the Company exercised a purchase option
under the lease and, in October 2007, purchased the land and
building.

The
Company leases certain laboratory and office equipment under operating leases
which expire at various times through 2011.

As
described above, the term of the Company’s operating lease for its new
facilities in Tarrytown, New York commenced in mid-2008; as a result, the
Company began recognizing rent expense in connection with this new lease, even
though actual rent payments will not commence until August 2009. In addition to
its rent expense for various facilities, the Company paid additional rental
charges for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses of $8.4
million, $8.8 million, and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively.

b. Convertible Debt

In
October 2001, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of
convertible senior subordinated notes (“Notes”) in a private placement for
proceeds to the Company of $192.7 million, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discount and out-of-pocket expenses (collectively, “Deferred
Financing Costs”). The Notes bore interest at 5.5% per annum, payable
semi-annually, and matured on October 17, 2008. Deferred Financing Costs, which
were included in other assets, were amortized as interest expense over the
period from the Notes’ issuance to stated maturity. During the second and third
quarters of 2008, the Company repurchased $82.5 million in principal amount of
the Notes for $83.3 million and recognized a $0.9 million loss on early
extinguishment of debt, representing the premium paid on the Notes plus related
unamortized Deferred Financing Costs. The remaining $117.5 million of
outstanding Notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in October 2008.

c. Research Collaboration and
Licensing Agreements

As part
of the Company’s research and development efforts, the Company enters into
research collaboration and licensing agreements with related and unrelated
companies, scientific collaborators, universities, and consultants. These
agreements contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and
milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be provided, and ownership
rights to certain proprietary technology developed under the agreements. Some of
the agreements contain provisions which require the Company to pay royalties, as
defined, at rates that range from 0.25% to 16.5%, in the event the Company sells
or licenses any proprietary products developed under the respective agreements.

Certain
agreements under which the Company is required to pay fees permit the Company,
upon 30 to 90-day written notice, to terminate such agreements. With respect to
payments associated with these agreements, the Company incurred expenses of $3.5
million, $1.0 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively.

otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
data)

In
connection with the Company’s receipt of marketing approval from the FDA for
ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) for the treatment of CAPS, in 2008, the Company commenced
paying royalties under various licensing agreements based on ARCALYST net
product sales. For the year ended December 31, 2008, ARCALYST royalties totaled
$0.6 million and are included in cost of goods sold.

In July
2008, the Company and Cellectis S.A. (“Cellectis”) entered into an Amended and
Restated Non-Exclusive License Agreement (the “Cellectis Agreement”). The
Cellectis Agreement resolved a dispute between the parties related to the
interpretation of a license agreement entered into by the parties in December
2003 pursuant to which the Company licensed certain patents and patent
applications from Cellectis. Pursuant to the Cellectis Agreement, in July 2008,
the Company made a non-refundable $12.5 million payment to Cellectis (the
“Cellectis Payment”) and agreed to pay Cellectis a low single-digit royalty
based on revenue received by the Company from any future licenses or sales of
the Company’s

VelociGene

®

or

VelocImmune

®

products and services. No
royalties are payable with respect to the Company’s

VelocImmune

license agreements with
AstraZeneca UK Limited (“AstraZeneca”) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”) or
the Company’s November 2007 collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Moreover, no
royalties are payable on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from
the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology.

The
Company began amortizing the Cellectis Payment in the second quarter of 2008 in
proportion to past and future anticipated revenues under the Company’s license
agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas and the Discovery and Preclinical
Development Agreement under the Company’s November 2007 collaboration with
sanofi-aventis. In 2008, the Company recognized $2.7 million of expense in
connection with the Cellectis Payment.

10. Research and Development
Agreements

The
Company has entered into various agreements related to its activities to develop
and commercialize product candidates and utilize its technology platforms.
Amounts earned by the Company in connection with these agreements, which were
recognized as contract research and development revenue, totaled $192.2 million,
$96.6 million, and $51.1 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Total
Company incurred expenses associated with these agreements, which include
reimbursable and non-reimbursable amounts, an allocable portion of general and
administrative costs, and cost-sharing of a collaborator’s development expenses,
where applicable (see Bayer HealthCare below), were $230.6 million, $108.2
million and $43.4 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Significant
agreements of this kind are described below.

a. The sanofi-aventis Group

Aflibercept

In
September 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Aventis
Agreement”) with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to sanofi-aventis
U.S.), to jointly develop and commercialize aflibercept. In connection with this
agreement, sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0
million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of the
Company’s Common Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, the Company and
sanofi-aventis amended the Aventis Agreement to exclude intraocular delivery of
aflibercept to the eye (“Intraocular Delivery”) from joint development under the
agreement, and product rights to aflibercept in Intraocular Delivery reverted to
Regeneron. In connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a $25.0
million non-refundable payment to Regeneron (the “Intraocular Termination
Payment”) in January 2005.

In
December 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the Aventis Agreement to
expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development
of aflibercept to include Japan. In connection with this amendment,
sanofi-aventis agreed to make a $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to
the Company, which was received in January 2006. Under the Aventis Agreement, as
amended, the Company and sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and
profits on sales, if any, of aflibercept outside of Japan, for disease
indications included in the companies’ collaboration. The Company is entitled to
a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of aflibercept in Japan, subject
to certain potential adjustments. The Company may also receive up to $400
million in milestone

payments upon receipt of specified
marketing approvals, including up to $360 million in milestone payments related
to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight aflibercept oncology and
other indications in the United States or the European Union and up to $40
million related to receipt of marketing approvals for up to five aflibercept
oncology indications in Japan.

Under the
Aventis Agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide development expenses
incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by
sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes profitable, Regeneron will be
obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses, or
half of $446.5 million as of December 31, 2008, in accordance with a formula
based on the amount of development expenses and Regeneron’s share of the
collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at Regeneron’s
option. Regeneron has the option to conduct additional pre-Phase III studies at
its own expense. In connection with the January 2005 amendment to the Aventis
Agreement, the Intraocular Termination Payment of $25.0 million will be
considered an aflibercept development expense and will be subject to 50%
reimbursement by Regeneron to sanofi-aventis, as described above, if the
collaboration becomes profitable. In addition, if the first commercial sale of
an aflibercept product in Intraocular Delivery predates the first commercial
sale of an aflibercept product under the collaboration by two years, Regeneron
will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of aflibercept
development expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial
aflibercept sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause
with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon termination of the agreement
for any reason, Regeneron’s obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis, for 50% of
aflibercept development expenses will terminate, and the Company will retain all
rights to aflibercept.

Revenue
related to payments from sanofi-aventis under the Aventis Agreement, as amended,
is being recognized in accordance with SAB 104 and EITF 00-21 (see Note 2). The
up-front payments received in September 2003 and January 2006, of $80.0 million
and $25.0 million, respectively, and reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred
development expenses, are being recognized as contract research and development
revenue over the related performance period. The Company recognized $44.4
million, $47.1 million, and $47.8 million of contract research and development
revenue in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in connection with the Aventis
Agreement, as amended. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, amounts receivable from
sanofi-aventis totaled $6.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively, and
deferred revenue was $52.4 million and $61.2 million, respectively, in
connection with the Aventis Agreement.

Antibodies

In
November 2007, the Company entered into a global, strategic collaboration (the
“Antibody Collaboration”) with sanofi-aventis to discover, develop, and
commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. In connection with the
collaboration, in December 2007, sanofi-aventis purchased 12 million newly
issued; unregistered shares of the Company’s Common Stock for $312.0 million
(see Note 8).

The Antibody Collaboration is
governed by a Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement (the “Discovery
Agreement”) and a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “License Agreement”).
The Company received a non-refundable up-front payment of $85.0 million from
sanofi-aventis under the Discovery Agreement. In addition, sanofi-aventis will
fund up to $475 million of the Company’s research for identifying and validating
potential drug discovery targets and developing fully human monoclonal
antibodies against such targets through December 31, 2012, subject to specified
funding limits of $75 million for the period from the collaboration’s inception
through December 31, 2008, and $100 million annually in each of the next four
years. The Discovery Agreement will expire on December 31, 2012; however,
sanofi-aventis has an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional
three years for further antibody development and preclinical
activities.

For each
drug candidate identified under the Discovery Agreement, sanofi-aventis has the
option to license rights to the candidate under the License Agreement. If it
elects to do so, sanofi-aventis will co-develop the drug candidate with the
Company through product approval. If sanofi-aventis does not exercise its option
to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the License Agreement,
the Company will retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such
drug candidate, and sanofi-aventis will receive a royalty on sales, if any. The
first three therapeutic antibodies that are being co-developed by the Company
and sanofi-aventis under the License Agreement are REGN88, REGN421, and REGN475.

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

For the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007, and 2006

(Unless
otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
data)

Under the
License Agreement, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both
companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis,
except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a
co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that
drug candidate (“Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs”) will be shared 80% by
sanofi-aventis and 20% by Regeneron. If the Antibody Collaboration becomes
profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of
development expenses that were fully funded by sanofi-aventis (or half of $27.8
million as of December 31, 2008) and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs, in
accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and the
Company’s share of collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration
products.

Sanofi-aventis will lead commercialization activities for products
developed under the License Agreement, subject to the Company’s right to
co-promote such products. The parties will equally share profits and losses from
sales within the United States. The parties will share profits outside the
United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65%
(sanofi-aventis)/35% (Regeneron) and ending at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45%
(Regeneron), and losses outside the United States at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45%
(Regeneron). In addition to profit sharing, the Company is entitled to receive
up to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments
commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales outside the United States
exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.

Regeneron is obligated to use
commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug
candidate under the Antibody Collaboration until commercial supplies of that
drug candidate are being manufactured.

With
respect to each antibody product which enters development under the License
Agreement, sanofi-aventis or the Company may, by giving twelve months notice,
opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which
event the other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development
and/or commercialization of the product. The Company may also opt-out of the
further development of an antibody product if it gives notice to sanofi-aventis
within thirty days of the date that sanofi-aventis enters joint development of
such antibody product under the License Agreement. Each of the Discovery
Agreement and the License Agreement contains other termination provisions,
including for material breach by the other party and, in the case of the
Discovery Agreement, a termination right for sanofi-aventis under certain
circumstances, including if certain minimal criteria for the discovery program
are not achieved. Prior to December 31, 2012, sanofi-aventis has the right to
terminate the Discovery Agreement without cause with at least three months
advance written notice; however, except under defined circumstances,
sanofi-aventis would be obligated to immediately pay to the Company the full
amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the research
agreement through December 31, 2012. Upon termination of the collaboration in
its entirety, the Company’s obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for
development costs out of any future profits from collaboration products will
terminate. Upon expiration of the Discovery Agreement, sanofi-aventis has an
option to license the Company’s

VelocImmune

®

technology for agreed upon consideration.

In
connection with the Antibody Collaboration, in August 2008, the Company entered
into a separate agreement with sanofi-aventis to use Regeneron’s proprietary

VelociGene

®

technology platform to supply
sanofi-aventis with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and
disease (the “

VelociGene

Agreement”). The VelociGene Agreement provides for minimum
annual order quantities for the term of the agreement which extends through
December 2012, for which the Company expects to receive payments totaling a
minimum of $21.5 million.

Revenue related to payments from
sanofi-aventis under the Antibody Collaboration is being recognized in
accordance with SAB 104 and EITF 00-21 (see Note 2). The (i) $85.0 million
up-front payment received in December 2007, (ii) reimbursement of
Regeneron-incurred expenses under the Discovery and License Agreements, and
(iii) $21.5 million of aggregate minimum payments under the

VelociGene

Agreement are
being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the related
performance period. In connection with the Antibody Collaboration, the Company
recognized $109.6 million and $4.6 million of contract research and development
revenue in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and
2007, amounts receivable from sanofi-aventis totaled $27.0 million and $3.7
million and deferred revenue was $74.6 million and $84.1 million, respectively.

b. Bayer HealthCare
LLC

In
October 2006, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement
with Bayer HealthCare LLC to globally develop, and commercialize outside the
United States, the Company’s VEGF Trap for the treatment of eye disease by local
administration (“VEGF Trap-Eye”). Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer
HealthCare made a non-refundable up-front payment to the Company of $75.0
million. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive up to $110 million in
development and regulatory milestones related to the VEGF Trap-Eye program, of
which the Company received a $20.0 million milestone payment in August 2007 in
connection with the initiation of a Phase 3 trial of VEGF Trap-Eye in the
neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (“wet AMD”). The Company is
also eligible to receive up to an additional $135 million in sales milestones
when and if total annual sales of VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States
achieve certain specified levels starting at $200 million.

The Company will share equally with
Bayer HealthCare in any future profits arising from the commercialization of
VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States. If VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing
authorization in a major market country outside the United States and the
collaboration becomes profitable, the Company will be obligated to reimburse
Bayer HealthCare out of its share of the collaboration profits for 50% of the
agreed upon development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred (or half of
$63.0 million as of December 31, 2008) in accordance with a formula based on the
amount of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred and the
Company’s share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at the
Company’s option. Within the United States, the Company is responsible for any
future commercialization of VEGF Trap-Eye and retains exclusive rights to any
future profits from commercialization.

Agreed
upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred by both companies in 2007 and
2008 under a global development plan, were shared as follows:

2007:

The first $50.0 million was
      shared equally and the Company was solely responsible for up to the next
      $40.0 million.

2008:

The first $70.0 million was
      shared equally and the Company was solely responsible for up to the next
      $30.0 million.

In 2009
and thereafter, all development expenses will be shared equally. Neither party
was reimbursed for any development expenses that it incurred prior to 2007. The
Company is also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply
clinical and commercial product requirements.

Bayer
HealthCare has the right to terminate the Bayer Agreement without cause with at
least six months or twelve months advance notice depending on defined
circumstances at the time of termination. In the event of termination of the
agreement for any reason, the Company retains all rights to VEGF
Trap-Eye.

For the
period from the collaboration’s inception in October 2006 through September 30,
2007, all up-front licensing, milestone, and cost-sharing payments received or
receivable from Bayer HealthCare had been fully deferred and included in
deferred revenue for financial statement purposes. In the fourth quarter of
2007, Regeneron and Bayer HealthCare approved a global development plan for VEGF
Trap-Eye in wet AMD. The plan included estimated development steps, timelines,
and costs, as well as the projected responsibilities of and costs to be incurred
by each of the companies. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2007, Regeneron
and Bayer HealthCare reaffirmed the companies’ commitment to a DME development
program and had initial estimates of development costs for VEGF Trap-Eye in DME.
As a result, effective in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company determined the
appropriate accounting policy for payments from Bayer HealthCare and
cost-sharing of the Company’s and Bayer HealthCare’s VEGF Trap-Eye development
expenses. The $75.0 million up-front licensing payment and $20.0 million
milestone payment (which was not considered substantive) from Bayer HealthCare
are being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the
related estimated performance period in accordance with SAB 104 and EITF 00-21
(see Note 2). In periods when the Company recognizes VEGF Trap-Eye development
expenses that the Company incurs under the collaboration, the Company also
recognizes, as contract research and development revenue, the portion of those
VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare.
In periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development
expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron,

the Company also recognizes, as
additional research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s
VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company commenced recognizing previously
deferred payments from Bayer HealthCare and cost-sharing of the Company’s and
Bayer HealthCare’s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses through a cumulative
catch-up.

In 2008,
the Company recognized $31.2 million of contract research and development
revenue from Bayer HealthCare, consisting of $12.4 million related to the
up-front licensing and milestone payments and $18.8 million related to the
portion of the Company’s 2008 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that was
reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In 2007, the Company recognized $35.9
million of contract research and development revenue from Bayer HealthCare,
consisting of $15.9 million related to the up-front licensing and milestone
payments and $20.0 million related to the portion of the Company’s 2007 VEGF
Trap-Eye development expenses that was reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In
addition, in 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized as additional research and
development expense $30.0 million and $10.6 million, respectively, of VEGF
Trap-Eye development expenses that the Company was obligated to reimburse to
Bayer HealthCare.

In
connection with cost-sharing of VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses under the
collaboration, $9.8 million and $4.9 million was payable to Bayer HealthCare at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $2.8 million was receivable from
Bayer HealthCare at December 31, 2007. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and
2007, deferred revenue from the Company’s collaboration with Bayer HealthCare
was $66.7 million and $79.1 million, respectively.

c. Serono, S.A. (now part of
Merck KGaA)

In
December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Serono Agreement”)
with Serono S.A. to use Regeneron’s proprietary

VelociGene

®

technology platform to provide Serono with knock-out and transgenic mammalian
models of gene function (“Materials”). The Serono Agreement contains provisions
for minimum yearly order quantities. In connection with its orders for
Materials, Serono makes advance payments to Regeneron, which are accounted for
as deferred revenue. Regeneron recognizes revenue and reduces the deferred
revenue balance as Materials are shipped to and accepted by Serono. In 2008,
2007, and 2006, the Company recognized $0.9 million, $2.4 million, and $1.8
million, respectively, of contract research and development revenue in
connection with the Serono Agreement.

d. National Institutes of Health

In
September 2006, the Company was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of
Health (“NIH”) as part of the NIH’s Knockout Mouse Project. As amended, the NIH
grant provides a minimum of $24.5 million in funding over a five-year period,
including $1.5 million in funding to optimize certain existing technology,
subject to compliance with its terms and annual funding approvals, for the
Company’s use of its

VelociGene

technology to generate a collection of targeting vectors and
targeted mouse embryonic stem cells which can be used to produce knockout mice.
In 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company recognized contract research and
development revenue of $4.9 million, $5.5 million, and $0.5 million,
respectively, from the NIH Grant.

11. Technology Licensing
Agreements

In
February 2007, the Company entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with
AstraZeneca UK Limited that allows AstraZeneca to utilize the Company’s

VelocImmune

®

technology in its internal research programs to
discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement,
AstraZeneca made two $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payments to the
Company, one in 2007 and the other in 2008. Each annual payment is deferred and
recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing twelve-month
period. AstraZeneca is required to make up to four additional annual payments of
$20.0 million, subject to their ability to terminate the agreement after making
two such additional payments or earlier if the technology does not meet minimum
performance criteria. The Company is entitled to receive a mid-single-digit
royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by AstraZeneca using
the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology. In connection with the AstraZeneca license
agreement, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
recognized $20.0 million and $17.1 million of revenue. In addition, deferred
revenue at both December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $2.9 million.

In March
2007, the Company entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Astellas
Pharma Inc. that allows Astellas to utilize the Company’s

VelocImmune

®

technology in its internal research programs to
discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement, Astellas
made two $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payments to the Company, one in
2007 and the other in 2008. Each annual payment is deferred and, recognized as
revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing twelve-month period. Astellas is
required to make up to four additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject
to their ability to terminate the agreement after making two such additional
payments or earlier if the technology does not meet minimum performance
criteria. The Company is entitled to receive a mid-single-digit royalty on any
future sales of antibody products discovered by Astellas using the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology. In connection with the Astellas license agreement, for the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized $20.0 million and $11.3
million of revenue. In addition, deferred revenue at both December 31, 2008 and
2007 was $8.7 million.

12. Manufacturing
Agreement

During
1995, the Company entered into a long-term manufacturing agreement with Merck
& Co., Inc., as amended, (the “Merck Agreement”) to produce an intermediate
(the “Intermediate”) for a Merck pediatric vaccine at the Company’s Rensselaer,
New York facility. The Company modified portions of its facility for manufacture
of the Intermediate and assisted Merck in securing regulatory approval for such
manufacture in the Company’s facility. The Merck Agreement called for the
Company to manufacture Intermediate for Merck for a specified period of time
(the “Production Period”), with certain minimum order quantities each year. The
Production Period commenced in November of 1999 and, as amended, extended
through October 2006, at which time the Merck Agreement terminated.

Merck
agreed to reimburse the Company for the capital costs to modify the facility
(“Capital Costs”). Merck also agreed to pay an annual facility fee (the
“Facility Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning March 1995, subject to annual
adjustment for inflation. During the Production Period, Merck agreed to
reimburse the Company for certain manufacturing costs, pay the Company a
variable fee based on the quantity of Intermediate supplied to Merck, and make
additional bi-annual payments (“Additional Payments”), as defined. In addition,
Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for miscellaneous costs during the
Production Period (“Internal Costs”). These payments were recognized as contract
manufacturing revenue as follows: (i) payments for Internal Costs were
recognized as the activities were performed, (ii) the Facility Fee and
Additional Payments were recognized over the period to which they related, (iii)
payments for Capital Costs were deferred and recognized as Intermediate was
shipped to Merck, and (iv) payments related to the manufacture of Intermediate
during the Production Period were recognized after the Intermediate was tested
and approved by, and shipped (FOB shipping point) to, Merck. In 2006, Merck
contract manufacturing revenue totaled $12.3 million, which included $1.2
million of previously deferred Capital Costs.

13. ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) Product Revenue

In
February 2008, the Company received marketing approval from the FDA for
ARCALYST

for the treatment of CAPS. For the year-ended December 31, 2008, the
Company recognized as revenue $6.3 million of ARCALYST net product sales for
which the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably
estimated. At December 31, 2008, deferred revenue related to ARCALYST net
product sales totaled $4.0 million.

Cost of goods sold related to
ARCALYST sales totaled $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and
consisted primarily of royalties (see Note 9c). In 2008, ARCALYST shipments to
the Company’s customers consisted of supplies of inventory manufactured and
expensed prior to FDA approval of ARCALYST; therefore, the costs of these
supplies were not included in costs of goods sold. At December 31, 2008, the
Company had no inventoried costs related to ARCALYST.

14. Long-Term Incentive
Plans

During
2000, the Company established the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term
Incentive Plan which, as amended and restated (the “2000 Incentive Plan”),
provides for the issuance of up to 28,816,184 shares of Common Stock in respect
of awards. In addition, shares of Common Stock previously approved by
shareholders for

issuance under the Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“1990 Incentive Plan”) that
are not issued under the 1990 Incentive Plan, may be issued as awards under the
2000 Incentive Plan. Employees of the Company, including officers, and
nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members of the Company’s
board of directors, (collectively, “Participants”) may receive awards as
determined by a committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The awards
that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include: (a) Incentive Stock
Options (“ISOs”) and Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
(c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and (e) Other Awards.

Stock
Option awards grant Participants the right to purchase shares of Common Stock at
prices determined by the Committee; however, in the case of an ISO, the option
exercise price will not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common
Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest over a period of time
determined by the Committee, generally on a pro rata basis over a three to five
year period. The Committee also determines the expiration date of each Option;
however, no ISO is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant. The
maximum term of options that have been awarded under the 2000 Incentive Plan is
ten years.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares of restricted Common
Stock or allow Participants to purchase such shares at a price determined by the
Committee. Such shares are nontransferable for a period determined by the
Committee (“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as defined by the
2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the Restricted Stock, which has not
vested, will be transferred to the Company, except under defined circumstances
with Committee approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the
Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company requires a
return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the right to require a return of
all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom
Stock awards provide the Participant the right to receive, within 30 days of the
date on which the share vests, an amount, in cash and/or shares of the Company’s
Common Stock as determined by the Committee, equal to the sum of the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests
and the aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to a share of
Common Stock during the period from the grant date of the share of Phantom Stock
to the date on which the share vests. Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in
shares of Common Stock which are granted at the discretion of the
Committee.

Other
Awards are other forms of awards which are valued based on the Company’s Common
Stock. Subject to the provisions of the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and
provisions of such Other Awards are determined solely on the authority of the
Committee.

During
1990, the Company established the 1990 Incentive Plan which, as amended,
provided for a maximum of 6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of awards.
Employees of the Company, including officers, and nonemployees, including
consultants and nonemployee members of the Company’s board of directors,
received awards as determined by a committee of independent directors. Under the
provisions of the 1990 Incentive Plan, there will be no future awards from the
plan. Awards under the 1990 Incentive Plan consisted of Incentive Stock Options
and Nonqualified Stock Options which generally vested on a pro rata basis over a
three or five year period and have a term of ten years.

The 1990
and 2000 Incentive Plans contain provisions that allow for the Committee to
provide for the immediate vesting of awards upon a change in control of the
Company, as defined.

As of December 31, 2008, there were
6,912,833 shares available for future grants under the 2000 Incentive Plan.

The
Company satisfies stock option exercises with newly issued shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised
during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $11.9 million, $12.6 million, and $13.2 million,
respectively. The intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market
price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an
option.

The
Company grants stock options with exercise prices that are equal to or greater
than the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The
table below summarizes the weighted-average exercise prices and weighted-average
grant-date fair values of options issued during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2007, and 2008. The fair value of each option granted under the 2000
Incentive Plan during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

$18.4 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based employee compensation
expense related to stock option awards was recognized in operating expenses. As
of December 31, 2008, there was $46.3 million of stock-based compensation cost
related to outstanding nonvested stock options, net of estimated forfeitures,
which had not yet been recognized in operating expenses. The Company expects to
recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. In
addition, there were 1,302,260 performance-based options which were unvested as
of December 31, 2008 of which, subject to the optionee satisfying certain
service conditions, 664,760 options would vest upon achieving certain defined
sales targets for the Company’s products and 637,500 options would vest upon
achieving certain development milestones for the Company’s product candidates.
Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant date, related to these
performance options totals $9.1 million and will begin to be recognized only if,
and when, these options’ performance conditions are considered to be probable of
attainment.

Fair value
Assumptions:

Using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model, fair value is calculated based on
assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of the Company’s Common
Stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of the
Company’s board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to
exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on the Company’s Common
Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted U.S.
Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options’
expected lives. Expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements
in the Company’s stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent
to the options’ expected lives. Expected lives are principally based on the
Company’s limited historical exercise experience with previously issued employee
and board of director option grants. The expected dividend yield is zero as the
Company has never paid dividends and does not currently anticipate paying any in
the foreseeable future.

The
following table summarizes the weighted average values of the assumptions used
in computing the fair value of option grants during 2008, 2007, and
2006.

In
December 2007, the Company awarded a grant of Restricted Stock to the Company’s
executive vice president. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company records unearned compensation in Stockholders’ Equity
related to grants of Restricted Stock awards. This amount is based on the fair
market value of shares of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and is
expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the period that the restriction on these
shares lapse, which is five years for the grant made in 2007. In addition,
unearned compensation in Stockholders’ Equity is reduced due to forfeitures of
Restricted Stock resulting from employee terminations. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123R, unearned compensation was included as a separate component of
Stockholders’ Equity. Effective January 1, 2006, unearned compensation is
combined with additional paid-in capital in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 123R.

In
connection with the 2007 grant of Restricted Stock, the Company recorded
unearned compensation in Stockholders’ Equity of $11.0 million, which was
combined with additional paid-in capital. In connection with forfeitures of past
Restricted Stock awards, the Company reduced unearned compensation by $17
thousand in 2006. The Company recognized non-cash stock-based employee
compensation expense from Restricted Stock awards of $2.2 million, $0.1 million,
and $0.3 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2008,
there were 500,000 unvested shares of Restricted Stock outstanding and $8.7
million of stock-based compensation cost related to these unvested shares which
had not yet been recognized in operating expenses. The Company expects to
recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of 4.0
years.

15. Executive Stock Purchase
Plan

In 1989,
the Company adopted an Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) under which
1,027,500 shares of Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock awards. The
Plan provides for the compensation committee of the board of directors to award
employees, directors, consultants, and other individuals (“Plan participants”)
who render service to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock at a price
set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides for the vesting of shares
as determined by the compensation committee and, should the Company’s
relationship with a Plan participant terminate before all shares are vested,
unvested shares will be repurchased by the Company at a price per share equal to
the original amount paid by the Plan participant. During 1989 and 1990, a total
of 983,254 shares were issued, all of which vested as of December 31, 1999. As
of December 31, 2008, there were 44,246 shares available for future grants under
the Plan.

16. Employee Savings
Plan

In 1993,
the Company adopted the provisions of the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k)
Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide for
employees who have met defined service requirements to participate in the
Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the Savings Plan a percentage of their
compensation to be set aside to pay their future retirement benefits, as
defined. The Savings Plan, as amended and restated, provides for

data)

the Company to make discretionary
contributions (“Contribution”), as defined. The Company recorded Contribution
expense of $1.5 million in 2008, $1.4 million in 2007, and $1.3 million in 2006;
such amounts were accrued as liabilities at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. During the first quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company
contributed 81,086, 58,575, and 64,532 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to
the Savings Plan in satisfaction of these obligations.

17. Income Taxes

For the
year ended December 31, 2008, the Company incurred a net loss for tax purposes
and recognized a full tax valuation against deferred taxes. During 2008, the
Company implemented a tax planning strategy to utilize net operating loss
carry-forwards (which were otherwise due to expire in 2008 through 2012) on its
2007 U.S. federal and New York State income tax returns that were filed in
September 2008. The tax planning strategy included electing, for tax purposes
only, to capitalize $142.1 million of 2007 research and development (“R&D”)
costs and amortize these costs over ten years for tax purposes. By capitalizing
these R&D costs, the Company was able to generate taxable income for tax
year 2007 and utilize the net operating loss carry-forwards to offset this
taxable income. As a result, the Company incurred and paid income tax expense of
$3.1 million in 2008, which related to U.S. federal and New York State
alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and included $0.2 million of interest and
penalties. This expense was partly offset by the Company’s recognition of a $0.7
million income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting from
a provision in the Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 that allows the Company to
claim a refund for a portion of its unused pre-2006 research tax credits on its
2008 U.S federal income tax return.

For the
year ended December 31, 2007, the Company had projected to incur a net loss for
tax purposes and recognized a full tax valuation against deferred taxes.
Accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded in 2007.
Subsequently, the Company implemented the tax planning strategy described above,
which resulted in taxable income in 2007 on which the Company recognized and
paid U.S. federal and New York State AMT in 2008. For the year ended December
31, 2006, the Company incurred a net loss for tax purposes and recognized a full
tax valuation against deferred taxes. Accordingly, no provision or benefit for
income taxes was recorded in 2006.

The tax
effect of temporary differences, net operating loss carry-forwards, and research
and experimental tax credit carry-forwards as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 is
as follows:



Deferred tax assets:

The
Company’s valuation allowance increased by $37.4 million in 2008, due primarily
to the increase in the temporary difference related to capitalized research and
development costs, resulting from the implementation of the tax planning
strategy described above. In 2007, the Company’s valuation allowance increased
by $30.7 million, due primarily to the temporary difference related to deferred
revenue, principally resulting from the non-refundable, up-front payment
received from sanofi-aventis in December 2007 (see Note 10).

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation
of FASB Statement No. 109

. The implementation
of FIN 48 had no impact on the Company’s financial statements as the Company has
not recognized any income tax positions that were deemed uncertain under the
recognition thresholds and measurement attributes prescribed by FIN
48.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

For the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
data)

The
Company is primarily subject to U.S. federal and New York State income tax. The
Company’s effective income tax rate is generally zero for all years presented.
The difference between the Company’s effective income tax rate and the U.S
federal statutory rate of 35% is attributable to state tax benefits and tax
credit carry-forwards offset by an increase in the deferred tax valuation
allowance. The Company’s 1998 and subsequent tax years remain open to
examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.

The
Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax
matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters.

As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had available for tax purposes unused net
operating loss carry-forwards of $415.4 million which will expire in various
years from 2018 to 2028 and included $17.0 million of net operating loss
carry-forwards related to exercises of Nonqualified Stock Options and
disqualifying dispositions of Incentive Stock Options, the tax benefit from
which, if realized, will be credited to additional paid-in capital. The
Company’s research and experimental tax credit carry-forwards expire in various
years from 2009 to 2028. Under the Internal Revenue Code and similar state
provisions, substantial changes in the Company’s ownership have resulted in an
annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit
carry-forwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable
income. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating
losses and tax credit carry-forwards before utilization.

18. Legal Matters

From time
to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings in the course of the
Company’s business. The Company does not expect any such current legal
proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or
financial condition. Legal costs associated with the Company’s resolution of
legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.

19. Net Loss Per Share
Data

The
Company’s basic net loss per share amounts have been computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding.
Net loss per share is presented on a combined basis, inclusive of Common Stock
and Class A Stock outstanding, as each class of stock has equivalent economic
rights. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company reported net losses; therefore, no
common stock equivalents were included in the computation of diluted net loss
per share since such inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of
basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:

21. Segment
Information

In 2008
and 2007, the Company managed its business as one segment which included all
activities related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products for the treatment
of serious medical conditions, and the development and commercialization of
these discoveries. This segment also included revenues and expenses related to
(i) research and development activities conducted under the Company’s
collaboration agreements with third parties and the Company’s grant from the
NIH, (ii) ARCALYST

®

(rilonacept) product sales for the
treatment of CAPS, and (iii) the supply of specified, ordered research materials
using Regeneron-developed proprietary technology. In 2006, the Company’s
operations were managed in two business segments: research and development, and
contract manufacturing; therefore, segment information has only been provided
for 2006 in the table below. In 2006, the contract manufacturing segment
included all revenues and expenses related to the commercial production of a
product under a contract with Merck, which expired in October 2006. The
accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described above in
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

As described above in Note 10,
      effective in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company determined the
      appropriate accounting policy for payments from Bayer HealthCare. As a
      result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, when the Company commenced
      recognizing previously deferred payments from Bayer HealthCare and
      cost-sharing of the Company’s and Bayer HealthCare’s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye
      development expenses, the Company recognized contract research and
      development revenue from Bayer HealthCare of $35.9 million and additional
      research and development expense of $10.6 million.
