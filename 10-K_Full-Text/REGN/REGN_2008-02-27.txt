General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company
    that discovers, develops, and intends to commercialize
    pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical
    conditions. We currently have four clinical development
    programs, including three late-stage clinical programs:
    ARCALYST

TM

(rilonacept;
    also known as

IL-1Trap)

in
    various inflammatory indications, aflibercept (VEGF Trap) in
    oncology, and the VEGF Trap-Eye formulation in eye diseases
    using intraocular delivery. Aflibercept is being developed in
    oncology in collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group. The
    VEGF Trap-Eye is being developed in collaboration with Bayer
    HealthCare LLC. Our fourth clinical development program is
    REGN88, an antibody to the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that
    is being developed with sanofi-aventis. REGN88 entered clinical
    development in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the fourth
    quarter of 2007. We expect that our next generation of product
    candidates will be based on our proprietary technologies for
    developing human monoclonal antibodies. Our antibody program is
    being conducted in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our
    preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and
    angiogenesis, ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases,
    muscle diseases and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases,
    bone and cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases.
    Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant
    risk and expense. Since inception we have not generated any
    sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
    product candidates.

Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in
    basic scientific research and discovery-enabling technology and
    combine that foundation with our manufacturing and clinical
    development capabilities to build a successful, integrated
    biopharmaceutical company. We believe that our ability to
    develop product candidates is enhanced by the application of our
    technology platforms. Our discovery platforms are designed to
    identify specific genes of therapeutic interest for a particular
    disease or cell type and validate targets through
    high-throughput production of mammalian models. Our human
    monoclonal antibody technology
    (

VelocImmune

®

)
    and cell line expression technologies may then be utilized to
    design and produce new product candidates directed against the
    disease target. Based on the

VelocImmune

platform which
    we believe, in conjunction with our other proprietary
    technologies, can accelerate the development of fully human
    monoclonal antibodies, we moved our first antibody product
    candidate (REGN88) into clinical trials in the fourth quarter of
    2007. We plan to advance two new antibody product candidates
    into clinical development in 2008 and an additional two to three
    antibody product candidates each year thereafter beginning in
    2009. We continue to invest in the development of enabling
    technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, and
    commercialize new product candidates.

Late-Stage
    Clinical Programs:

1.

ARCALYST

TM

—
    Inflammatory Diseases

ARCALYST

TM

(rilonacept;
    also known as

IL-1Trap)

is
    a protein-based product candidate designed to bind the
    interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine and prevent its interaction
    with cell surface receptors. We are evaluating
    ARCALYST

TM

in a number of diseases and disorders where IL-1 may play an
    important role, including a group of


rare diseases called Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes
    (CAPS) and other diseases associated with inflammation.

In November 2007, we announced that we received notification
    from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the
    action date for the FDA’s priority review of the Biologics
    License Application (BLA) for
    ARCALYST

TM

in CAPS had been extended three months to February 29,
    2008. In August 2007, the FDA granted priority review status to
    the BLA for
    ARCALYST

TM

for the long-term treatment of CAPS. The FDA previously granted
    Orphan Drug status and Fast Track designation to
    ARCALYST

TM

for the treatment of CAPS. In July 2007,
    ARCALYST

TM

also received Orphan Drug designation in the European Union for
    the treatment of CAPS.

CAPS represents a group of rare inherited auto-inflammatory
    conditions, including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome
    (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS). CAPS also includes
    Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID).
    ARCALYST

TM

has not been studied, and is not expected to be indicated, for
    the treatment of NOMID. The syndromes included in CAPS are
    characterized by spontaneous, systemic inflammation and are
    termed auto-inflammatory disorders. A novel feature of these
    conditions (particularly FCAS and MWS) is that exposure to mild
    degrees of cold temperature can provoke a major inflammatory
    episode that occurs within hours. CAPS is caused by a range of
    mutations in the gene NLRP3

(formerly known as

CIAS1

) which encodes a protein named cryopyrin.
    Currently, there are no medicines approved for the treatment of
    CAPS.

We have initiated a Phase 2 safety and efficacy trial of
    ARCALYST

TM

in the prevention of gout flares induced by the initiation of
    uric acid-lowering drug therapy used to control the disease. We
    previously reported positive results from an exploratory proof
    of concept study of
    ARCALYST

TM

in ten patients with chronic active gout. In those patients,
    treatment with
    ARCALYST

TM

demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in patient
    pain scores in the single-blind, placebo-controlled study. Mean
    patients’ pain scores, the key symptom measure in
    persistent gout, were reduced 41% (p=0.025) during the first two
    weeks of active treatment and reduced 56% (p<0.004) after
    six weeks of active treatment. In this study, in which safety
    was the primary endpoint measure, treatment with
    ARCALYST

TM

was generally well-tolerated. We are also evaluating the
    potential use of
    ARCALYST

TM

in
    other indications in which IL-1 may play a role.

Under a March 2003 collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma
    AG, we retain the right to elect to collaborate in the future
    development and commercialization of a Novartis IL-1 antibody
    which is in clinical development. Following completion of Phase
    2 development and submission to us of a written report on the
    Novartis IL-1 antibody, we have the right, in consideration for
    an opt-in payment, to elect to co-develop and co-commercialize
    the Novartis IL-1 antibody in North America. If we elect to
    exercise this right, we are responsible for paying 45% of
    post-election North American development costs for the antibody
    product. In return, we are entitled to co-promote the Novartis
    IL-1 antibody and to receive 45% of net profits on sales of the
    antibody product in North America. Under certain circumstances,
    we are also entitled to receive royalties on sales of the
    Novartis IL-1 antibody in Europe.

Under the collaboration agreement, Novartis has the right to
    elect to collaborate in the development and commercialization of
    a second generation IL-1 Trap following completion of its Phase
    2 development, should we decide to clinically develop such a
    second generation product candidate. Novartis does not have any
    rights or options with respect to our
    ARCALYST

TM

product candidate currently in clinical development.

2.

Aflibercept
    (VEGF Trap) — Oncology

Aflibercept is a protein-based product candidate designed to
    bind all forms of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (called
    VEGF-A, also known as Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF) and
    the related Placental Growth Factor (called PlGF), and prevent
    their interaction with cell surface receptors. VEGF-A (and to a
    less validated degree, PlGF) is required for the growth of new
    blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent
    regulator of vascular permeability and leakage.

Aflibercept is being developed in cancer indications in
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis. We and sanofi-aventis began
    the first four trials of our global Phase 3 development program
    in the second half of 2007. One trial is evaluating aflibercept
    in combination with docetaxel/prednisone in patients with first
    line metastatic androgen


independent prostate cancer. A second trial is evaluating
    aflibercept in combination with docetaxel in patients with
    second line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The third
    Phase 3 trial is evaluating aflibercept in first-line metastatic
    pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine. The fourth
    Phase 3 trial is evaluating aflibercept in second-line
    metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI
    (Folinic Acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan). In
    all of these trials, aflibercept is being combined with the
    current standard of chemotherapy care for the stated development
    stage of the cancer type.

The collaboration is conducting a number of other trials in the
    global development program for aflibercept. Five safety and
    tolerability studies of aflibercept in combination with standard
    chemotherapy regimens are continuing in a variety of cancer
    types to support the Phase 3 clinical program. Sanofi-aventis
    has also expanded the development program to Japan, where they
    are conducting a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study in
    combination with another investigational agent in patients with
    advanced solid malignancies.

The collaboration is also conducting Phase 2 single-agent
    studies of aflibercept in advanced ovarian cancer (AOC),
    non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLA), and AOC patients
    with symptomatic malignant ascites (SMA). The AOC and NSCLA
    trials are fully enrolled and ongoing. The SMA trial is
    approximately 50% enrolled and continues to enroll patients. In
    2004, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to aflibercept for
    the treatment of SMA.

In addition, more than 10 studies are currently underway or
    scheduled to begin that are being conducted in conjunction with
    the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation
    Program (CTEP) evaluating aflibercept as a single agent or in
    combination with chemotherapy regimens in a variety of cancer
    indications.

The first registration submission to a regulatory agency for
    aflibercept is possible as early as 2008, potentially as third
    line treatment as a single agent in advanced ovarian cancer
    (AOC) or in AOC patients with SMA. However, in order for our
    ongoing Phase 2 study in AOC to be sufficient to support such a
    submission, we believe that the final unblinded results of the
    study would have to demonstrate a more robust response rate than
    that reported in the interim analysis of blinded data from the
    study presented in June 2007 at the annual meeting of the
    American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

Cancer is a heterogeneous set of diseases and one of the leading
    causes of death in the developed world. A mutation in any one of
    dozens of normal genes can eventually result in a cell becoming
    cancerous; however, a common feature of cancer cells is that
    they need to obtain nutrients and remove waste products, just as
    normal cells do. The vascular system normally supplies nutrients
    to and removes waste from normal tissues. Cancer cells can use
    the vascular system either by taking over preexisting blood
    vessels or by promoting the growth of new blood vessels (a
    process known as angiogenesis). Vascular Endothelial Growth
    Factor (VEGF) is secreted by many tumors to stimulate the growth
    of new blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to the
    tumor. VEGF blockers have been shown to inhibit new vessel
    growth, and, in some cases, can cause regression of existing
    tumor vasculature. Countering the effects of VEGF, thereby
    blocking the blood supply to tumors, has demonstrated
    therapeutic benefits in clinical trials. This approach of
    inhibiting angiogenesis as a mechanism of action for an oncology
    medicine was validated in February 2004, when the FDA approved
    Genentech, Inc.’s VEGF inhibitor,
    Avastin

®

.
    Avastin

®

(a trademark of Genentech, Inc.) is an antibody product designed
    to inhibit VEGF and interfere with the blood supply to tumors.

Aflibercept
    Collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
    with Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (predecessor to
    sanofi-aventis U.S.) to collaborate on the development and
    commercialization of aflibercept in all countries other than
    Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and
    commercialize aflibercept. In January 2005, we and
    sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration agreement to exclude,
    from the scope of the collaboration, the development and
    commercialization of aflibercept for intraocular delivery to the
    eye. In December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our
    collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the
    companies are collaborating on the development of aflibercept to
    include Japan. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we
    and sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
    sales, if any, of aflibercept outside of Japan for disease
    indications included in our collaboration. In Japan, we are
    entitled to a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of
    aflibercept, subject to certain potential adjustments. We may
    also receive up to $400.0 million in milestone


payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals. This
    total includes up to $360.0 million in milestone payments
    related to receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight
    aflibercept oncology and other indications in the United States
    or the European Union. Another $40.0 million of milestone
    payments relate to receipt of marketing approvals for up to five
    oncology indications in Japan.

Under the aflibercept collaboration agreement, as amended,
    agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both
    companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by
    sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will
    be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of aflibercept
    development expenses in accordance with a formula based on the
    amount of development expenses and our share of the
    collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate
    at our option.

VEGF
    Trap — Eye Diseases

The VEGF Trap-Eye is a form of the VEGF Trap that has been
    purified and formulated with excipients and at concentrations
    suitable for direct injection into the eye. The VEGF Trap-Eye
    currently is being tested in a Phase 3 trial in patients with
    the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (wet
    AMD) and has completed a small pilot study in patients with
    diabetic macular edema (DME).

In the clinical development program for the VEGF Trap-Eye, we
    and Bayer HealthCare have initiated a Phase 3 study of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in wet AMD. This first trial, known as VIEW 1
    (

V

EGF Trap:

I

nvestigation of

E

fficacy and
    Safety in

et age-related macular degeneration), is
    comparing the VEGF Trap-Eye and Genentech, Inc.’s
    Lucentis

®

(ranibizumab), an anti-angiogenic agent approved for use in wet
    AMD. This Phase 3 trial is evaluating dosing intervals of four
    and eight weeks for the VEGF Trap-Eye compared with ranibizumab
    dosed according to its label every four weeks. We and Bayer
    HealthCare plan to initiate a second Phase 3 trial in wet AMD in
    2008. This second trial will be conducted primarily in the
    European Union and other parts of the world outside the U.S.

In October 2007, we and Bayer HealthCare announced positive
    results from the full analysis of the primary

12-week

endpoint of a Phase 2 study evaluating the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet
    AMD. The VEGF Trap-Eye met the primary study endpoint of a
    statistically significant reduction in retinal thickness, a
    measure of disease activity, after 12 weeks of treatment
    compared with baseline (all five dose groups combined, mean
    decrease of 119 microns, p<0.0001). The mean change from
    baseline in visual acuity, a key secondary endpoint of the
    study, also demonstrated statistically significant improvement
    (all groups combined, increase of 5.7 letters, p<0.0001).
    Preliminary analyses at 16 weeks showed that the VEGF
    Trap-Eye, dosed monthly, achieved a mean gain in visual acuity
    of 9.3 to 10 letters (for the 0.5 and 2 mg dose groups,
    respectively). In additional exploratory analyses, the VEGF
    Trap-Eye, dosed monthly, reduced the proportion of patients with
    vision of 20/200 or worse (a generally accepted definition for
    legal blindness) from 14.3% at baseline to 1.6% at week 16; the
    proportion of patients with vision of 20/40 or better (part of
    the legal minimum requirement for an unrestricted driver’s
    license in the U.S.) was likewise increased from 19.0% at
    baseline to 49.2% at 16 weeks. These findings were
    presented at the Retina Society Conference in September 2007.

We and Bayer HealthCare are also developing the VEGF Trap-Eye in
    DME. In May 2007, at the annual meeting of the Association for
    Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), the companies
    reported results from a small pilot study of the VEGF Trap-Eye
    in patients with DME. In the study, the VEGF Trap-Eye was well
    tolerated and demonstrated activity in five patients, with
    decreases in retinal thickness and improvement in visual acuity.

VEGF-A both stimulates angiogenesis and increases vascular
    permeability. It has been shown in preclinical studies to be a
    major pathogenic factor in both wet AMD and diabetic
    retinopathy, and it is believed to be involved in other medical
    problems affecting the eyes. In clinical trials, blocking VEGF-A
    has been shown to be effective in patients with wet AMD, and
    Macugen

®

(OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and
    Lucentis

®

(Genentech, Inc.) have been approved to treat patients with this
    condition.

Wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are two of the leading
    causes of adult blindness in the developed world. In both
    conditions, severe visual loss is caused by a combination of
    retinal edema and neovascular proliferation. DR is a major
    complication of diabetes mellitus that can lead to significant
    vision impairment. DR is


characterized, in part, by vascular leakage, which results in
    the collection of fluid in the retina. When the macula, the
    central area of the retina that is responsible for fine visual
    acuity, is involved, loss of visual acuity occurs. This is
    referred to as diabetic macular edema (DME). DME is the most
    prevalent cause of moderate visual loss in patients with
    diabetes.

Collaboration
    with Bayer HealthCare

In October 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Bayer HealthCare for the global development and
    commercialization outside the United States of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye. Under the agreement, we and Bayer HealthCare will
    collaborate on, and share the costs of, the development of the
    VEGF Trap-Eye through an integrated global plan that encompasses
    wet AMD, diabetic eye diseases, and other diseases and
    disorders. Bayer HealthCare will market the VEGF Trap-Eye
    outside the United States, where the companies will share
    equally in profits from any future sales of the VEGF Trap-Eye.
    If the VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing authorization in a
    major market country outside the United States, we will be
    obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare for 50% of the
    development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from
    our share of the collaboration profits. Within the United
    States, we retain exclusive commercialization rights to the VEGF
    Trap-Eye and are entitled to all profits from any such sales. We
    received an up-front payment of $75.0 million from Bayer
    HealthCare. In 2007, we received a $20.0 million milestone
    payment from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first
    patient in the Phase 3 study of the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD,
    and can earn up to $90.0 million in additional development
    and regulatory milestones related to the development of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye and marketing approvals in major market countries
    outside the United States. We can also earn up to
    $135.0 million in sales milestones if total annual sales of
    the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States achieve certain
    specified levels starting at $200.0 million.

Antibody
    Research Technologies and Development Program:

One way that a cell communicates with other cells is by
    releasing specific signaling proteins, either locally or into
    the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct functions, and are
    classified into different “families” of molecules,
    such as peptide hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. All of
    these secreted (or signaling) proteins travel to and are
    recognized by another set of proteins, called
    “receptors,” which reside on the surface of responding
    cells. These secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and
    biological processes, causing diverse effects ranging from the
    regulation of growth of particular cell types, to inflammation
    mediated by white blood cells. Secreted proteins can at times be
    overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases. In these
    disease settings, blocking the action of secreted proteins can
    have clinical benefit.

Regeneron scientists have developed two different technologies
    to design protein therapeutics to block the action of specific
    secreted proteins. The first technology, termed the
    “Trap” technology, was used to generate our current
    clinical pipeline, including aflibercept, the VEGF Trap-Eye, and
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    These novel “Traps” are composed of fusions between
    two distinct receptor components and the constant region of an
    antibody molecule called the “Fc region”, resulting in
    high affinity product candidates.

Regeneron scientists also have discovered and developed a new
    technology for designing protein therapeutics that facilitates
    the discovery and production of fully human monoclonal
    antibodies. We call our technology

VelocImmune

®

and, as described below, we believe that it is an
    improved way of generating a wide variety of high affinity,
    therapeutic, fully human monoclonal antibodies.

VelocImmune

®

(Human Monoclonal Antibodies)

We have developed a novel mouse technology platform, called

VelocImmune

, for producing fully human monoclonal
    antibodies. The

VelocImmune

mouse platform was generated
    by exploiting our

VelociGene

technology platform (see
    below), in a process in which six megabases of mouse immune gene
    loci were replaced, or “humanized,” with corresponding
    human immune gene loci. The

VelocImmune

mice can be used
    to generate efficiently fully human monoclonal antibodies to
    targets of therapeutic interest.

VelocImmune

and our
    related technologies offer the potential to increase the speed
    and efficiency through which human monoclonal antibody
    therapeutics may be discovered and validated, thereby improving
    the overall efficiency of our early stage drug development
    activities. We are utilizing the

VelocImmune

technology
    to produce our next generation of drug


candidates for preclinical development and are exploring
    possible additional licensing or collaborative arrangements with
    third parties related to

VelocImmune

and related
    technologies.

Antibody
    Collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group

In November 2007, we and sanofi-aventis entered into a global,
    strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize
    fully human monoclonal antibodies. The first therapeutic
    antibody to enter clinical development under the collaboration,
    REGN88, is an antibody to the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R),
    which has started clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis. The
    second is expected to be an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4
    (Dll4) which is currently scheduled to commence clinical
    development in mid-2008. The collaboration is governed by a
    Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement and a License
    and Collaboration Agreement. We received a non-refundable,
    up-front payment of $85.0 million from sanofi-aventis under
    the discovery agreement. In addition, sanofi-aventis will fund
    up to $475.0 million of our research for identifying and
    validating potential drug discovery targets and developing fully
    human monoclonal antibodies against these targets through
    December 31, 2012. Sanofi-aventis also has an option to
    extend the discovery program for up to an additional three years
    for further antibody development and preclinical activities.

For each drug candidate identified under the discovery
    agreement, sanofi-aventis has the option to license rights to
    the candidate under the license agreement. If it elects to do
    so, sanofi-aventis will co-develop the drug candidate with us
    through product approval. Development costs will be shared
    between the companies, with sanofi-aventis funding drug
    candidate development costs up front. We are responsible for
    reimbursing sanofi-aventis for half of the total development
    costs it paid for all collaboration products from our share of
    profits from commercialization of collaboration products to the
    extent they are sufficient for this purpose. Sanofi-aventis will
    lead commercialization activities for products developed under
    the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such
    products. The parties will equally share profits and losses from
    sales within the United States. The parties will share profits
    outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales
    starting at 65% (sanofi-aventis)/35% (us) and ending at 55%
    (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us), and will share losses outside the
    United States at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us). In addition to
    profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to
    $250.0 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone
    payments commencing after aggregate annual sales outside the
    United States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling

12-month

basis.

License
    Agreement with AstraZeneca

In February 2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license
    agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited that allows AstraZeneca to
    utilize our

VelocImmune

®

technology in its internal research programs to discover human
    monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement,
    AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million non-refundable, up-front
    payment to us. AstraZeneca is required to make up to five
    additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to its
    ability to terminate the agreement after making the first three
    additional payments or earlier if the technology does not meet
    minimum performance criteria. We are entitled to receive a
    mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
    products discovered by AstraZeneca using our

VelocImmune

technology.

License
    Agreement with Astellas

In March 2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement
    with Astellas Pharma Inc. that allows Astellas to utilize our

VelocImmune

technology in its internal research programs
    to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the
    agreement, Astellas made a $20.0 million non-refundable,
    up-front payment to us. Astellas is required to make up to five
    additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to its
    ability to terminate the agreement after making the first three
    additional payments or earlier if the technology does not meet
    minimum performance criteria. We are entitled to receive a
    mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
    products discovered by Astellas using our

VelocImmune

technology.

VelociGene

®

and
    VelociMouse

tm

(Target Validation)

Our

VelociGene

platform allows custom and precise
    manipulation of very large sequences of DNA to produce highly
    customized alterations of a specified target gene and
    accelerates the production of knock-out and transgenic


expression models without using either positive/negative
    selection or isogenic DNA. In producing knock-out models, a
    color or fluorescent marker is substituted in place of the
    actual gene sequence, allowing for high-resolution visualization
    of precisely where the gene is active in the body, during normal
    body functioning, as well as in disease processes. For the
    optimization of pre-clinical development and toxicology
    programs,

VelociGene

offers the opportunity to humanize
    targets by replacing the mouse gene with the human homolog.
    Thus,

VelociGene

allows scientists to rapidly identify
    the physical and biological effects of deleting or
    over-expressing the target gene, as well as to characterize and
    test potential therapeutic molecules.

The

VelociMouse

technology also allows for the direct and
    immediate generation of genetically altered mice from embryonic
    stem cells (ES cells), thereby avoiding the lengthy process
    involved in generating and breeding knockout mice from chimeras.
    Mice generated through this method are normal and healthy and
    exhibit a 100% germ-line transmission. Furthermore,
    Regeneron’s

VelociMice

are suitable for direct
    phenotyping or other studies.

National
    Institutes of Health Grant

In September 2006, we were awarded a five-year grant from the
    National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the NIH’s
    Knockout Mouse Project. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Project
    is to build a comprehensive and broadly available resource of
    knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function
    and human diseases. We use our

VelociGene

technology to
    take aim at 3,500 of the most difficult genes to target and
    which are not currently the focus of other large-scale knockout
    mouse programs. We also agreed to grant a limited license to a
    consortium of research institutions, the other major
    participants in the Knockout Mouse Project, to use components of
    our

VelociGene

technology in the Knockout Mouse Project.
    We are generating a collection of targeting vectors and targeted
    mouse ES cells which can be used to produce knockout mice.
    These materials will be made widely available to academic
    researchers without charge. We will receive a fee for each
    targeted ES cell line or targeting construct made by us or the
    research consortium and transferred to commercial entities.

Under the NIH grant, we are entitled to receive a minimum of
    $17.9 million over a five-year period. We will receive
    another $1.0 million to optimize our existing C57BL/6 ES
    cell line and its proprietary growth medium, both of which will
    be supplied to the research consortium for its use in the
    Knockout Mouse Project. We have the right to use, for any
    purpose, all materials generated by us and the research
    consortium.

Cell
    Line Expression Technologies

Many proteins that are of potential pharmaceutical value are
    proteins which are “secreted” from the cells into the
    bloodstream. Examples of secreted proteins include growth
    factors (such as insulin and growth hormone) and antibodies.
    Current technologies for the isolation of cells engineered to
    produce high levels of secreted proteins are both laborious and
    time consuming. We have developed enabling platforms for the
    high-throughput, rapid generation of high-producing cell lines
    for our Traps and our

VelocImmune

human monoclonal
    antibodies.

Research
    Programs

:

Oncology
    and Angiogenesis

In many clinical settings, positively or negatively regulating
    blood vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits,
    as could the repair of damaged and leaky vessels. VEGF was the
    first growth factor shown to be specific for blood vessels, by
    virtue of having its receptor specifically expressed on blood
    vessel cells. In 1994, we discovered a second family of
    angiogenic growth factors, termed Angiopoietins, and we have
    received patents covering members of this family. Angiopoietins
    include naturally occurring positive and negative regulators of
    angiogenesis, as described in numerous scientific manuscripts
    published by our scientists and their collaborators.
    Angiopoietins are being evaluated in preclinical research by us
    and our academic collaborators. Our preclinical studies have
    revealed that VEGF and Angiopoietins normally function in a
    coordinated and collaborative manner during blood vessel growth.
    Manipulation of both VEGF and Angiopoietins seems to be of value
    in blocking vessel growth. We have research programs focusing on
    several targets in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis.

Tumors depend on the growth of new blood vessels (a process
    called “angiogenesis”) to support their continued
    growth. Therapies that block tumor angiogenesis, specifically
    those that block VEGF, the key initiator of


tumor angiogenesis, recently have been validated in human cancer
    patients. However, anti-VEGF approaches do not work in all
    patients, and many tumors can become resistant to such therapies.

In the December 21, 2006 issue of the journal

Nature,

we reported data from a preclinical study demonstrating that
    blocking an important cell signaling molecule, known as
    Delta-like Ligand 4 (Dll4), inhibited the growth of experimental
    tumors by interfering with their ability to produce a functional
    blood supply. The inhibition of tumor growth was seen in a
    variety of tumor types, including those that were resistant to
    blockade of VEGF, suggesting a novel anti-angiogenesis
    therapeutic approach. We plan in mid-2008 to commence Phase 1
    clinical development of a fully human monoclonal antibody to
    Dll4 that was discovered using our

VelocImmune

technology.

Metabolic
    and Related Diseases

Food intake and metabolism are regulated by complex interactions
    between diverse neural and hormonal signals that serve to
    maintain an optimal balance between energy intake, storage, and
    utilization. The hypothalamus, a small area at the base of the
    brain, is critically involved in integrating peripheral signals
    which reflect nutritional status and neural outputs which
    regulate appetite, food seeking behaviors, and energy
    expenditure. Metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes,
    reflect a dysregulation in the systems which ordinarily tightly
    couple energy intake to energy expenditure. Our preclinical
    research program in this area encompasses the study of
    peripheral (hormonal) regulators of food intake and metabolism
    in health and disease. We have identified several targets in
    these therapeutic areas and are evaluating potential antibodies
    to evaluate in preclinical studies.

Muscle
    Diseases and Disorders

Muscle atrophy occurs in many neuromuscular diseases and also
    when muscle is unused, as often occurs during prolonged hospital
    stays and during convalescence. Currently, physicians have few
    options to treat subjects with muscle atrophy or other muscle
    conditions which afflict millions of people globally. Thus, a
    treatment that has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle could
    have significant clinical benefit. Our muscle research program
    is currently focused on conducting in vivo and in vitro
    experiments with the objective of demonstrating and further
    understanding the molecular pathways involved in muscle atrophy
    and hypertrophy, and discovering therapeutic candidates that can
    modulate these pathways. We have several molecules in late stage
    research and are evaluating them for possible further
    development.

Other
    Therapeutic Areas

We also have research programs focusing on ophthalmology,
    inflammatory and immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain, and
    cardiovascular diseases.

Manufacturing

In 1993, we purchased our 104,000 square foot Rensselaer,
    New York manufacturing facility, and in 2003 completed a
    19,500 square foot expansion of this facility. This
    facility is used to manufacture therapeutic candidates for our
    own preclinical and clinical studies. We also used the facility
    to manufacture a product for Merck & Co., Inc. under a
    contract that expired in October 2006. In July 2002, we leased
    75,000 square feet in a building near our Rensselaer
    facility which we have used primarily for the manufacture of
    Traps and for warehouse space. In June 2007, we exercised a
    purchase option on this building, which totals
    272,000 square feet (including the 75,000 square feet
    we already leased), and completed the purchase of this property
    in October 2007. At December 31, 2007, we employed
    207 people at our Rensselaer facilities. There were no
    impairment losses associated with long-lived assets at these
    facilities as of December 31, 2007.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a
    medicine is the requirement that the prospective
    manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
    conform to the good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations of
    the health authority. In complying with standards set forth in
    these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time,
    money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control
    to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing
    establishments, both foreign and domestic, are also subject to
    inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other
    national, federal, state, and local agencies. If our
    manufacturing facilities fail


to comply with FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be
    required to suspend manufacturing. This would likely have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations, and cash flow.

Competition

We face substantial competition from pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology, and chemical companies (see “Risk
    Factors —

Even if our product candidates are
    approved for marketing their commercial success is highly
    uncertain because our competitors have received approval for
    products with the same mechanism of action, and competitors may
    get to the marketplace before we do with better or lower cost
    drugs or the market for our product candidates may be too small
    to support commercialization or sufficient
    profitability

.”). Our competitors include Genentech,
    Novartis, Pfizer Inc., Bayer HealthCare, Onyx Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc., Abbott Laboratories, sanofi-aventis, Merck, Amgen Inc.,
    Roche, and others. Many of our competitors have substantially
    greater research, preclinical, and clinical product development
    and manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and
    human resources than we do. Our smaller competitors may also be
    significant if they acquire or discover patentable inventions,
    form collaborative arrangements, or merge with large
    pharmaceutical companies. Even if we achieve product
    commercialization, one or more of our competitors may achieve
    product commercialization earlier than we do or obtain patent
    protection that dominates or adversely affects our activities.
    Our ability to compete will depend on how fast we can develop
    safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing
    and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the
    product to the market. Competition among product candidates
    approved for sale will also be based on efficacy, safety,
    reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other
    factors.

ARCALYST

The
    availability of highly effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists
    such as
    Enbrel

®

(Immunex Corporation),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor, Inc.), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret (Amgen), and
    other marketed therapies, makes it difficult to successfully
    develop and commercialize
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    Even if
    ARCALYST

TM

is ever approved for sale, it will be difficult for our drug to
    compete against these FDA approved drugs because doctors and
    patients will have significant experience using these effective
    medicines. Moreover, there are both small molecules and
    antibodies in development by third parties that are designed to
    block the synthesis of interleukin-1 or inhibit the signaling of
    interleukin-1. For example, Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis, and
    Xoma Ltd. are each developing antibodies to interleukin-1 and
    Amgen is developing an antibody to the interleukin-1 receptor.
    These drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    The successful development of these competing molecules could
    delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
    commercialize
    ARCALYST

Aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye.

Many companies
    are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block the
    actions of VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A
    variety of approaches have been employed, including antibodies
    to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF receptor, small molecule
    antagonists to the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, and other
    anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of these alternative
    approaches may offer competitive advantages to our VEGF Trap in
    efficacy, side-effect profile, or method of delivery.
    Additionally, some of these molecules are either already
    approved for marketing or are at a more advanced stage of
    development than our product candidate.

In particular, Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
    Avastin

®

,
    on the market for treating certain cancers and a number of
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to
    develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, Pfizer,
    and Imclone Systems Incorporated. Many of these molecules are
    further along in development than aflibercept and may offer
    competitive advantages over our molecule. Novartis has an
    ongoing Phase 3 clinical development program evaluating an
    orally delivered VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor in different
    cancer settings. Each of Pfizer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals
    (together with its partner Bayer) has received approval from the
    FDA to market and sell an oral medication that targets tumor
    cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth
    of tumors.

The market for eye disease products is also very competitive.
    Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the
    commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody
    fragment
    (Lucentis

®

)
    for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD)
    and other eye indications that was approved by the FDA in June
    2006. Many other companies are working on the development of
    product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD that
    act by blocking VEGF, VEGF receptors, and through the use of
    soluble ribonucleic acids (sRNAs) that


modulate gene expression. In addition, ophthalmologists are
    using off-label a third-party reformulated version of
    Genentech’s approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin, with success
    for the treatment of wet AMD. The National Eye Institute plans
    to initiate a Phase 3 trial to compare Lucentis to Avastin in
    the treatment of wet AMD. Avastin is also being evaluated in eye
    diseases in trials that have been initiated in the United
    Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Israel, and other
    areas.

REGN88.

We are developing REGN88 for the
    treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as part of our global,
    strategic collaboration with sanofi-aventis to discover,
    develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies.
    The availability of highly effective FDA approved
    TNF-antagonists such as
    Enbrel

®

(Immunex),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott), and other marketed therapies makes it difficult to
    successfully develop and commercialize REGN88. REGN88 is a human
    monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor. Roche
    is developing an antibody against the interleukin-6 (IL-6)
    receptor. Roche’s antibody has completed Phase 3 clinical
    trials and is the subject of a filed Biologics License
    Application with the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid
    arthritis. Roche’s IL-6 receptor antibody, other clinical
    candidates in development, and the drugs on the market to treat
    rheumatoid arthritis could offer competitive advantages over
    REGN88. This could delay or impair our ability to successfully
    develop and commercialize REGN88.

Other Areas.

Many pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies are attempting to discover new
    therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time
    and resources. In these and related areas, intellectual property
    rights have been sought and certain rights have been granted to
    competitors and potential competitors of ours, and we may be at
    a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result
    of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained
    personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic
    competitors are involved in the discovery and development of
    novel therapeutics that are the focus of other research or
    development programs we are now conducting. These competitors
    include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many others. Many firms
    and entities are engaged in research and development in the
    areas of cytokines, interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle
    conditions. Some of these competitors are currently conducting
    advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these
    areas. These and other competitors may have established
    substantial intellectual property and other competitive
    advantages.

If a competitor announces a successful clinical study involving
    a product that may be competitive with one of our product
    candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory
    agency for a competitive product, the announcement may have an
    adverse effect on our operations or future prospects or on the
    market price of our Common Stock.

We also compete with academic institutions, governmental
    agencies, and other public or private research organizations,
    which conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish
    collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of
    products that would provide royalties or other consideration for
    use of their technology. These institutions are becoming more
    active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements
    to collect royalties or other consideration for use of the
    technology they have developed. Products developed in this
    manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also
    compete with others in acquiring technology from these
    institutions, agencies, and organizations.

Patents,
    Trademarks, and Trade Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents,
    maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing
    on the proprietary rights of third parties (see “Risk
    Factors —

We may be restricted in our development

and/or

commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage
    awards if we are found to have infringed, third party patents or
    other proprietary rights

.”). Our policy is to file
    patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and
    improvements that we consider important to our business and
    operations. We are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of
    additional U.S. patents and patent applications. We also
    rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological
    innovation in an effort to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We or our licensors or collaborators have filed patent
    applications on various products and processes relating to our
    product candidates as well as other technologies and inventions
    in the United States and in certain foreign countries. We intend
    to file additional patent applications, when appropriate,
    relating to improvements in


these technologies and other specific products and processes. We
    plan to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents
    and other proprietary technology.

Patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in
    the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are
    subject to this additional uncertainty. Others may independently
    develop similar products or processes to those developed by us,
    duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are
    issued to us, design around any products and processes covered
    by our patents. We expect to continue, when appropriate, to file
    product and process patent applications with respect to our
    inventions. However, we may not file any such applications or,
    if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or
    licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of
    others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can
    be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is
    favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued or licensed
    to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find
    that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties,
    or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of
    our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent
    rights of third parties.

Government
    Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the United States and
    foreign countries is a significant factor in the research,
    development, manufacture, and marketing of our product
    candidates (see “Risk Factors —

If we do not
    obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will
    not be able to market or sell them.

”). All of our
    product candidates will require regulatory approval before they
    can be commercialized. In particular, human therapeutic products
    are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and
    other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA and foreign
    authorities. Many aspects of the structure and substance of the
    FDA and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been
    reformed during recent years, and continued reform is under
    consideration in a number of jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome
    and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be
    predicted.

The activities required before a product candidate may be
    marketed in the United States begin with preclinical tests.
    Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal
    studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the
    product candidate and its formulations. The results of these
    studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an
    Investigational New Drug Application, which must be reviewed by
    the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically,
    clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In Phase 1,
    trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to
    determine the early safety profile of the product candidate. In
    Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted
    with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to
    evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
    different potential doses of the product candidate. In Phase 3,
    large-scale clinical trials are conducted with patients
    afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to
    provide enough data to understand the efficacy and safety
    profile of the product candidate, as required by the FDA. The
    results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic
    product candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a
    Biologics License Application, or BLA, for evaluation to
    determine whether the product candidate may be approved for
    commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant
    marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the
    application.

Any approval required by the FDA for any of our product
    candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The
    designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase
    is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be
    sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and
    a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase
    notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a
    particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or early
    stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or
    efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more
    broadly in humans.

Approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory
    authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to
    commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The
    approval procedure varies among countries and may involve
    additional testing, and the time required to obtain such
    approval may differ from that required for FDA approval.


Various federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations
    also govern or influence the research, manufacture, safety,
    labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport, and
    other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates. The lengthy
    process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with
    applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of
    substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or
    licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory
    approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing
    of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty
    revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and future business
    will be subject to regulation under the United States Atomic
    Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances
    Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
    national restrictions, and other current and potential future
    local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Business
    Segments

Through 2006, our operations were managed in two business
    segments: research and development, and contract manufacturing.
    The research and development segment includes all activities
    related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products for the
    treatment of serious medical conditions, and the development and
    commercialization of these discoveries. It also includes
    revenues and expenses related to (i) research and
    development activities conducted under our collaboration
    agreements with third parties and our grant from the NIH, and
    (ii) the supply of specified, ordered research materials
    using Regeneron-developed proprietary technology. The contract
    manufacturing segment included all revenues and expenses related
    to the commercial production of products under contract
    manufacturing arrangements. During 2006 and 2005, the Company
    manufactured a product for Merck under a contract that expired
    in October 2006. For financial information about these segments,
    see Note 20, “Segment Information”, beginning on

page F-36

in our Financial Statements. Due to the expiration of our
    manufacturing agreement with Merck, beginning in 2007, we only
    have a research and development business segment.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had 682 full-time
    employees, of whom 107 held a Ph.D. or M.D. degree or both. We
    believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and
    experienced personnel in a highly competitive environment;
    however, competition for these personnel is intense. None of our
    personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and
    our management considers its relations with our employees to be
    good.

Available
    Information

We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy
    statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    or the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials
    that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference
    Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The
    public may obtain information on the operation of the Public
    Reference Room by calling the SEC at

    SEC.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We operate in an environment that involves a number of
    significant risks and uncertainties. We caution you to read the
    following risk factors, which have affected,

and/or

in
    the future could affect, our business, operating results,
    financial condition, and cash flows. The risks described below
    include forward-looking statements, and actual events and our
    actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in
    these forward-looking statements. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial may also impair


our business operations. Furthermore, additional risks and
    uncertainties are described under other captions in this report
    and should be considered by our investors.

Risks
    Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Additional
    Financing

We
    have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve
    profitability. If we continue to incur operating losses, we may
    be unable to continue our operations.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
    2007, we had a cumulative loss of $793.2 million. If we
    continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a
    profitable company, we may be unable to continue our operations.
    We have no products that are available for sale and do not know
    when we will have products available for sale, if ever. In the
    absence of revenue from the sale of products or other sources,
    the amount, timing, nature or source of which cannot be
    predicted, our losses will continue as we conduct our research
    and development activities.

We may
    need additional funding in the future, which may not be
    available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce or
    eliminate our product development programs or commercialization
    efforts.

We will need to expend substantial resources for research and
    development, including costs associated with clinical testing of
    our product candidates. We believe our existing capital
    resources, including funding we are entitled to receive under
    our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet operating
    needs through at least 2012; however, one or more of our
    collaboration agreements may terminate, our projected revenue
    may decrease, or our expenses may increase and that would lead
    to our capital being consumed significantly before such time. We
    may require additional financing in the future and we may not be
    able to raise such additional funds. If we are able to obtain
    additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible
    debt securities, such sales may be dilutive to our shareholders.
    Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain
    assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business
    activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may
    contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders.
    If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the
    development of our product candidates, we may face delay,
    reduction or elimination of our research and development
    programs or preclinical or clinical trials, in which case our
    business, financial condition or results of operations may be
    materially harmed.

We
    have a significant amount of debt that is scheduled to mature in
    2008.

We have $200.0 million of convertible debt that, unless
    converted to shares of our Common Stock, will mature in October
    2008. Our debt obligations could require us to use a significant
    portion of our cash to pay principal and interest on our debt.

Risks
    Related to Development of Our Product Candidates

Successful
    development of any of our product candidates is highly
    uncertain.

Only a small minority of all research and development programs
    ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We have
    never developed a drug that has been approved for marketing and
    sale, and we may never succeed in developing an approved drug.
    Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness of
    any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the
    necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial
    success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their
    acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party
    payers and on our partners’ ability to successfully
    manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Our
    product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion
    or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are
    generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule
    delivery. If our products are not successfully commercialized,
    we will not be able to recover the significant investment we
    have made in developing such products and our business would be
    severely harmed.

We are studying our lead product candidates, aflibercept, VEGF
    Trap-Eye, and
    ARCALYST

TM

,
    in a wide variety of indications. We are studying aflibercept in
    a variety of cancer settings, the VEGF Trap-Eye in different eye
    diseases and ophthalmologic indications, and
    ARCALYST

TM

in a variety of systemic inflammatory disorders.


Many of these current trials are exploratory studies designed to
    identify what diseases and uses, if any, are best suited for our
    product candidates. It is likely that our product candidates
    will not demonstrate the requisite efficacy

and/or

safety profile to support continued development for most of the
    indications that are being, or are planned to be, studied. In
    fact, our product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite
    efficacy and safety profile to support the continued development
    for any of the indications or uses.

Clinical
    trials required for our product candidates are expensive and
    time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. If any of
    our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results, we
    will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory
    approval for our product candidates.

We must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates
    before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell
    them. We need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and
    human clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a lengthy,
    time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and trials
    may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including,
    among others, failure of the product candidate to demonstrate
    safety or efficacy, the development of serious or
    life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or
    connected with exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in
    enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial, lack
    of sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator
    drug, and the failure of clinical investigators, trial monitors
    and other consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the
    trial plan or protocol. A clinical trial may fail because it did
    not include a sufficient number of patients to detect the
    endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance. A
    clinical trial may also fail because the dose(s) of the
    investigational drug included in the trial were either too low
    or too high to determine the optimal effect of the
    investigational drug in the disease setting. For example, we are
    studying higher doses of
    ARCALYST

TM

in different diseases after a Phase 2 trial using lower doses of
    ARCALYST

TM

in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its
    primary endpoint.

We will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test
    favorably and either conduct new trials, which are expensive and
    time consuming, or abandon the drug development program. Even if
    we obtain positive results from preclinical or clinical trials,
    we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Many
    companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including us, have
    suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after
    promising results have been obtained in earlier trials. The
    failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and
    effectiveness for the desired indication(s) could harm the
    development of the product candidate(s), and our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations may be materially
    harmed.

The
    data from the Phase 3 clinical program for
    ARCALYST

TM

in CAPS (Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes) may be
    inadequate to support regulatory approval for commercialization
    of
    ARCALYST

TM

.

We submitted a completed BLA to the FDA for
    ARCALYST

TM

in CAPS in the second quarter of 2007. However, the efficacy and
    safety data from the Phase 3 clinical program included in the
    BLA may be inadequate to support approval for commercialization
    of
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    The FDA and other regulatory agencies may have varying
    interpretations of our clinical trial data, which could delay,
    limit, or prevent regulatory approval or clearance.

Further, before a product candidate is approved for marketing,
    our manufacturing facilities must be inspected by the FDA and
    the FDA will not approve the product for marketing if we or our
    third party manufacturers are not in compliance with current
    good manufacturing practices. Even if the FDA and similar
    foreign regulatory authorities do grant marketing approval for
    ARCALYST

TM

,
    they may pose restrictions on the use or marketing of the
    product, or may require us to conduct additional post-marketing
    trials. These restrictions and requirements would likely result
    in increased expenditures and lower revenues and may restrict
    our ability to commercialize
    ARCALYST

TM

profitably.

In addition to the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations
    in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign
    regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials,
    marketing and approval for drugs, and commercial sales and
    distribution of drugs in foreign countries. The foreign
    regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated
    with FDA approval as well as country-specific regulations.
    Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product in the
    United States, we must obtain approval by the comparable
    regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can
    commence clinical trials or marketing of
    ARCALYST

TM

in those countries.


Serious
    complications or side effects have occurred, and may continue to
    occur, in clinical trials of some of our product candidates
    which could lead to delay or discontinuation of development and
    severely harm our business.

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes
    in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts,
    to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine
    whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these
    conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have
    been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our
    product candidates. It is possible as we test our drug
    candidates in larger, longer, and more extensive clinical
    programs, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were
    observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not
    occur or went undetected in smaller previous trials, will be
    reported by patients. Many times, side effects are only
    detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large
    scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are
    made available to patients after approval. If additional
    clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates
    has many side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side
    effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be
    delayed, which would severely harm our business.

Our aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is being studied for the potential
    treatment of certain types of cancer and our VEGF Trap-Eye
    candidate is being studied in diseases of the eye. There are
    many potential safety concerns associated with significant
    blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. These
    serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on the
    clinical and preclinical experience of systemically delivered
    VEGF inhibitors, including the systemic delivery of the VEGF
    Trap, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension,
    and proteinuria. These serious side effects and other serious
    side effects have been reported in our systemic VEGF Trap
    studies in cancer and diseases of the eye. In addition, patients
    given infusions of any protein, including the VEGF Trap
    delivered through intravenous administration, may develop severe
    hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF
    blockers have reported side effects that became evident only
    after large scale trials or after marketing approval and large
    number of patients were treated. These include side effects that
    we have not yet seen in our trials such as heart attack and
    stroke. These and other complications or side effects could harm
    the development of aflibercept for the treatment of cancer or
    the VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of diseases of the eye.

It is possible that safety or tolerability concerns may arise as
    we continue to test
    ARCALYST

TM

in patients with inflammatory diseases and disorders. Like
    cytokine antagonists such as
    Kineret

®

(Amgen),
    Enbrel

®

(Immunex), and
    Remicade

®

(Centocor),
    ARCALYST

TM

affects the immune defense system of the body by blocking some
    of its functions. Therefore,
    ARCALYST

TM

may interfere with the body’s ability to fight infections.
    Treatment with
    Kineret

®

(Amgen), a medication that works through the inhibition of IL-1,
    has been associated with an increased risk of serious
    infections, and serious infections have been reported in
    patients taking
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    One subject with adult Still’s diseases in a study of
    ARCALYST

TM

developed an infection in his elbow with mycobacterium
    intracellulare. The patient was on chronic glucocorticoid
    treatment for Still’s disease. The infection occurred after
    an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection into the elbow and
    subsequent local exposure to a suspected source of mycobacteria.
    One patient with polymayalgia rheumatica in another study
    developed bronchitis/sinusitis, which resulted in
    hospitalization. One patient in an open-label study of
    ARCALYST

TM

in CAPS developed sinusitis and streptococcus pneumoniae
    meningitis and subsequently died. In addition, patients given
    infusions of
    ARCALYST

TM

have developed hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions.
    These or other complications or side effects could impede or
    result in us abandoning the development of
    ARCALYST

TM

.

Our
    product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that
    could cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of
    harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic
    protein.

In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and
    regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the
    administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an
    immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against
    the therapeutic protein. The antibodies can have no effect or
    can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or
    require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic
    effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react with the
    patient’s own proteins, resulting in an
    “auto-immune” type disease. Whether antibodies will be
    created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical
    experiments, and their detection or appearance is often delayed,
    so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies
    will not be detected at a later date, in some cases even after
    pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Of the clinical
    study subjects who


received
    ARCALYST

TM

for rheumatoid arthritis and other indications, fewer than 5% of
    patients developed antibodies and no side effects related to
    antibodies were observed. Using a very sensitive test,
    approximately 40% of the patients in the CAPS pivotal study
    tested positive at least once for low levels of antibodies to
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    Again, no side effects related to antibodies were observed and
    there were no observed effects on drug efficacy or drug levels.
    However, it is possible that as we continue to test aflibercept
    and VEGF Trap-Eye with more sensitive assays in different
    patient populations and larger clinical trials, we will find
    that subjects given aflibercept and VEGF Trap-Eye develop
    antibodies to these product candidates, and may also experience
    side effects related to the antibodies, which could adversely
    impact the development of such candidates.

We may
    be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in
    a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial
    use.

Changes in product formulations and manufacturing processes may
    be required as product candidates progress in clinical
    development and are ultimately commercialized. For example, we
    are currently testing a new formulation of the VEGF Trap-Eye. If
    we are unable to develop suitable product formulations or
    manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing
    of our product candidates, including aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye,
    ARCALYST

TM

,
    and REGN88, we may be unable to supply necessary materials for
    our clinical trials, which would delay the development of our
    product candidates. Similarly, if we are unable to supply
    sufficient quantities of our product or develop product
    formulations suitable for commercial use, we will not be able to
    successfully commercialize our product candidates.

Risks
    Related to Intellectual Property

If we
    cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our
    patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our
    business and competitive position will be harmed.

Our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology
    and other information that we protect as trade secrets. We seek
    to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through
    confidentiality agreements. If our trade secrets are improperly
    exposed, either by our own employees or our collaborators, it
    would help our competitors and adversely affect our business. We
    will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized
    use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are
    covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
    maintained as trade secrets. The patent position of
    biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual
    questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted
    with certainty. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated, or
    circumvented. Patent applications filed outside the United
    States may be challenged by third parties who file an
    opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly common
    in the European Union and are costly to defend. We have patent
    applications that are being opposed and it is likely that we
    will need to defend additional patent applications in the
    future. Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary
    position or competitive advantages against competitors.
    Furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to us, the
    enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely
    expensive and time consuming.

We may
    be restricted in our development and/or commercialization
    activities by, and could be subject to damage awards if we are
    found to have infringed, third party patents or other
    proprietary rights.

Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to
    operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary
    rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that they have
    blocking patents to our products in clinical development, either
    because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition
    of a product or the way it is manufactured or used. Moreover,
    other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to
    antibody products made using our

VelocImmune

technology,
    either because of the way the antibodies are discovered or
    produced or because of a proprietary position covering an
    antibody or the antibody’s target.

We are aware of patents and pending applications owned by
    Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptor
    compositions. Although we do not believe that aflibercept or the
    VEGF Trap-Eye infringes any valid claim in these patents or
    patent applications, Genentech could initiate a lawsuit for
    patent infringement and assert that its patents are valid and
    cover aflibercept or the VEGF Trap-Eye. Genentech may be
    motivated to initiate such a lawsuit at some point in an effort
    to impair our ability to develop and sell aflibercept or the
    VEGF Trap-Eye, which


represents a potential competitive threat to Genentech’s
    VEGF-binding products and product candidates. An adverse
    determination by a court in any such potential patent litigation
    would likely materially harm our business by requiring us to
    seek a license, which may not be available, or resulting in our
    inability to manufacture, develop and sell aflibercept or the
    VEGF Trap-Eye or in a damage award.

We are aware of patents and pending applications owned by Roche
    that claim antibodies to the interleukin-6 receptor and methods
    of treating rheumatoid arthritis with such antibodies. We are
    developing REGN88, an antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor,
    for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although we do not
    believe that REGN88 infringes any valid claim in these patents
    or patent applications, Roche could initiate a lawsuit for
    patent infringement and assert its patents are valid and cover
    REGN88.

Further, we are aware of a number of other third party patent
    applications that, if granted, with claims as currently drafted,
    may cover our current or planned activities. We cannot assure
    you that our products

and/or

actions in manufacturing and selling our product candidates will
    not infringe such patents.

In December 2003, we entered into a non-exclusive license
    agreement with Cellectis Inc. that granted us certain rights in
    a family of patents relating to homologous recombination.
    Cellectis now claims that agreements we entered into relating to
    our

VelocImmune

mice with AstraZeneca, Astellas, and
    sanofi-aventis are outside of the scope of our license from
    Cellectis. We disagree with Cellectis’ position and are in
    discussions with Cellectis regarding this matter. If we are not
    able to resolve this dispute, Cellectis may commence a lawsuit
    against us and our

VelocImmune

licensees alleging
    infringement of Cellectis’ patents.

Any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent
    us from manufacturing, selling, or developing our drug
    candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly
    issued patents of third parties. In the event that the
    manufacture, use, or sale of any of our clinical candidates
    infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of
    third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product
    development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our drugs
    and may be required to pay costly damages. Such a result may
    materially harm our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations. Legal disputes are likely to be costly and time
    consuming to defend.

We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment,
    such licenses are needed. If any licenses are required, we may
    not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable
    terms, if at all. The failure to obtain any such license could
    prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of
    our product candidates, which could severely harm our business.

Regulatory
    and Litigation Risks

If we
    do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we
    will not be able to market or sell them.

We cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval.
    If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our
    product candidates, the value of our company and our results of
    operations will be harmed. In the United States, we must obtain
    and maintain approval from the United States Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) for each drug we intend to sell. Obtaining
    FDA approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process, and
    approval is highly uncertain. Foreign governments also regulate
    drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country
    is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is
    highly uncertain. None of our product candidates has ever
    received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the
    United States or any other country. We may never receive
    regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA
    requires that the facilities at which the product will be
    manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing
    practices, or cGMP requirements. Manufacturing product
    candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is
    complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our
    products must be manufactured for development, following
    approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with
    regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any
    of our product collaborators or third-party manufacturers,
    product packagers, or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory
    compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including,
    among other things, refusal to approve a pending


application for a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of
    a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.

If the
    testing or use of our products harms people, we could be subject
    to costly and damaging product liability claims.

The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use
    in people expose us to product liability risk. Any informed
    consent or waivers obtained from people who sign up for our
    clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of
    litigation. Our product liability insurance may not cover all
    potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability
    arising from any such litigation. Moreover, we may not have
    access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our
    insurance on acceptable terms.

Our
    operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to
    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. We may
    incur substantial liability arising from our activities
    involving the use of hazardous materials.

As a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing
    operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health,
    and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the
    use of hazardous materials. Our research and development and
    manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of
    chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous
    materials. The cost of compliance with environmental, health,
    and safety regulations is substantial. If an accident involving
    these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we
    could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face
    regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or
    insurance coverage.

Changes
    in the securities laws and regulations have increased, and are
    likely to continue to increase, our costs.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which became law in July 2002,
    has required changes in some of our corporate governance,
    securities disclosure and compliance practices. In response to
    the requirements of that Act, the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock
    Market have promulgated rules and listing standards covering a
    variety of subjects. Compliance with these rules and listing
    standards has increased our legal costs, and significantly
    increased our accounting and auditing costs, and we expect these
    costs to continue. These developments may make it more difficult
    and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and
    officers’ liability insurance. Likewise, these developments
    may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain
    qualified members of our board of directors, particularly
    independent directors, or qualified executive officers.

In
    future years, if we are unable to conclude that our internal
    control over financial reporting is effective, the market value
    of our common stock could be adversely affected.

As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to
    include a report of management on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting in their annual reports on

Form 10-K

that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness
    of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition,
    the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our
    financial statements must attest to and report on the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Our independent registered public accounting firm provided us
    with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, which report is included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

However, we cannot assure you that management or our independent
    registered public accounting firm will be able to provide such
    an unqualified report as of future year-ends. In this event,
    investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our
    financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the
    market value of our common stock. In addition, if it is
    determined that deficiencies in the design or operation of
    internal controls exist and that they are reasonably likely to
    adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize, and
    report financial information, we would likely incur additional
    costs to remediate these deficiencies and the costs of such
    remediation could be material.


Risks
    Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties

If our
    antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis is terminated, our
    business operations and our ability to discover, develop,
    manufacture, and commercialize our pipeline of product
    candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be materially
    harmed.

We rely heavily on the funding from sanofi-aventis to support
    our target discovery and antibody research and development
    programs. Sanofi-aventis has committed to pay up to
    $475.0 million between 2008 and 2012 to fund our efforts to
    identify and validate drug discovery targets and pre-clinically
    develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against such targets.
    In addition, sanofi-aventis funds almost all of the development
    expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the
    clinical development of antibodies that sanofi-aventis elects to
    co-develop with us. We rely on sanofi-aventis to fund these
    activities. In addition, with respect to those antibodies that
    sanofi-aventis elects to co-develop with us, such as REGN88, we
    rely on sanofi-aventis to lead much of the clinical development
    efforts and assist with obtaining regulatory approval,
    particularly outside the United States. We also rely on
    sanofi-aventis to lead the commercialization efforts to support
    all of the antibody products that are co-developed by
    sanofi-aventis and us. If sanofi-aventis does not elect to
    co-develop the antibodies that we discover or opts-out of their
    development, we would be required to fund and oversee on our own
    the clinical trials, any regulatory responsibilities, and the
    ensuing commercialization efforts to support our antibody
    products. Sanofi-aventis may terminate the collaboration for our
    material breach or, in the case of the discovery agreement, if
    certain minimal criteria for the discovery program are not
    achieved by December 31, 2010. If sanofi-aventis terminates
    the antibody collaboration or fails to comply with its payment
    obligations thereunder, our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations would be materially harmed. We would be
    required to either expend substantially more resources than we
    have anticipated to support our research and development
    efforts, which could require us to seek additional funding that
    might not be available on favorable terms or at all, or
    materially cut back on such activities. While we cannot assure
    you that any of the antibodies from this collaboration will ever
    be successfully developed and commercialized, if sanofi-aventis
    does not perform its obligations with respect to antibodies that
    it elects to co-develop, our ability to develop, manufacture,
    and commercialize these antibody product candidates will be
    significantly adversely affected.

If our
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis for aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is
    terminated, or sanofi-aventis materially breaches its
    obligations thereunder, our business, operations and financial
    condition, and our ability to develop, manufacture, and
    commercialize aflibercept in the time expected, or at all, would
    be materially harmed.

We rely heavily on sanofi-aventis to lead much of the
    development of aflibercept. Sanofi-aventis funds all of the
    development expenses incurred by both companies in connection
    with the aflibercept program. If the aflibercept program
    continues, we will rely on sanofi-aventis to assist with funding
    the aflibercept program, provide commercial manufacturing
    capacity, enroll and monitor clinical trials, obtain regulatory
    approval, particularly outside the United States, and lead the
    commercialization of aflibercept. While we cannot assure you
    that aflibercept will ever be successfully developed and
    commercialized, if sanofi-aventis does not perform its
    obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to
    develop, manufacture, and commercialize aflibercept in cancer
    indications will be significantly adversely affected.
    Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate its collaboration
    agreement with us at any time upon twelve months advance notice.
    If sanofi-aventis were to terminate its collaboration agreement
    with us, we would not have the resources or skills to replace
    those of our partner, which could require us to seek additional
    funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at
    all, and could cause significant delays in the development

and/or

manufacture of aflibercept and result in substantial additional
    costs to us. We have limited commercial capabilities and would
    have to develop or outsource these capabilities. Termination of
    the sanofi-aventis collaboration agreement would create
    substantial new and additional risks to the successful
    development and commercialization of aflibercept.


If our
    collaboration with Bayer HealthCare for the VEGF Trap-Eye is
    terminated, or Bayer HealthCare materially breaches its
    obligations thereunder, our business, operations and financial
    condition, and our ability to develop and commercialize the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in the time expected, or at all, would be materially
    harmed.

We rely heavily on Bayer HealthCare to assist with the
    development of the VEGF Trap-Eye. Under our agreement with them,
    Bayer HealthCare is required to fund approximately half of the
    development expenses incurred by both companies in connection
    with the global VEGF Trap-Eye development program. If the VEGF
    Trap-Eye program continues, we will rely on Bayer HealthCare to
    assist with funding the VEGF Trap-Eye development program, lead
    the development of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States,
    obtain regulatory approval outside the United States, and
    provide all sales, marketing and commercial support for the
    product outside the United States. In particular, Bayer
    HealthCare has responsibility for selling VEGF Trap-Eye outside
    the United States using its sales force. While we cannot assure
    you that the VEGF Trap-Eye will ever be successfully developed
    and commercialized, if Bayer HealthCare does not perform its
    obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to
    develop, manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap-Eye
    outside the United States will be significantly adversely
    affected. Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate its
    collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve
    months advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving
    rise to termination. If Bayer HealthCare were to terminate its
    collaboration agreement with us, we would not have the resources
    or skills to replace those of our partner, which could require
    us to seek additional finding that might not be available on
    favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant delays in
    the development

and/or

commercialization of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States
    and result in substantial additional costs to us. We have
    limited commercial capabilities and would have to develop or
    outsource these capabilities outside the United States.
    Termination of the Bayer HealthCare collaboration agreement
    would create substantial new and additional risks to the
    successful development and commercialization of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye.

Our
    collaborators and service providers may fail to perform
    adequately in their efforts to support the development,
    manufacture, and commercialization of our drug
    candidates.

We depend upon third-party collaborators, including
    sanofi-aventis, Bayer HealthCare, and service providers such as
    clinical research organizations, outside testing laboratories,
    clinical investigator sites, and third-party manufacturers and
    product packagers and labelers, to assist us in the manufacture
    and development of our product candidates. If any of our
    existing collaborators or service providers breaches or
    terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its
    development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a
    timely manner or at all, we could experience additional costs,
    delays, and difficulties in the manufacture, development or
    ultimate commercialization of our product candidates.

Risks
    Related to the Manufacture of Our Product Candidates

We
    have limited manufacturing capacity, which could inhibit our
    ability to successfully develop or commercialize our
    drugs.

Our manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce
    sufficient quantities of product for commercial sale. We intend
    to rely on our corporate collaborators, as well as contract
    manufacturers, to produce the large quantities of drug material
    needed for commercialization of our products. We rely entirely
    on third-party manufacturers for filling and finishing services.
    We will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver
    material on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory
    requirements. If we are unable to supply sufficient material on
    acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or
    difficulties in our relationships with our corporate
    collaborators or contract manufacturers, our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.

We must expand our own manufacturing capacity to support the
    planned growth of our clinical pipeline. Moreover, we may expand
    our manufacturing capacity to support commercial production of
    active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, for our product
    candidates. This will require substantial additional
    expenditures, and we will need to hire and train significant
    numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our
    facility.

Start-up

costs can be large and

scale-up

entails significant risks related to process development and
    manufacturing yields. We may


be unable to develop manufacturing facilities that are
    sufficient to produce drug material for clinical trials or
    commercial use. This may delay our clinical development plans
    and interfere with our efforts to commercialize our products. In
    addition, we may be unable to secure adequate filling and
    finishing services to support our products. As a result, our
    business, financial condition, and results of operations may be
    materially harmed.

We may be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for
    the manufacture of our product candidates. In addition, we may
    face difficulties in developing or acquiring production
    technology and managerial personnel to manufacture sufficient
    quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in
    compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental
    regulations and governmental permitting requirements.

If any
    of our clinical programs are discontinued, we may face costs
    related to the unused capacity at our manufacturing
    facilities.

We have large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New
    York. We use our facilities to produce bulk product for clinical
    and preclinical candidates for ourselves and our collaborations.
    If our clinical candidates are discontinued, we will have to
    absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and
    inefficiencies.

Certain
    of our raw materials are single-sourced from third parties;
    third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability
    to supply our products.

Certain raw materials necessary for manufacturing and
    formulation of our product candidates are provided by
    single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. We would be
    unable to obtain these raw materials for an indeterminate period
    of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to
    cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these
    materials or products to us for any reason, including due to
    regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial
    developments at or affecting the supplier, or due to labor
    shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product
    candidates for use in clinical trials, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and future prospects.

Also, certain of the raw materials required in the manufacturing
    and the formulation of our clinical candidates may be derived
    from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine
    serum, and human serum albumin. There are certain European
    regulatory restrictions on using these biological source
    materials. If we are required to substitute for these sources to
    comply with European regulatory requirements, our clinical
    development activities may be delayed or interrupted.

Risks
    Related to Commercialization of Products

If we
    are unable to establish sales, marketing, and distribution
    capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to do
    so, we will be unable to successfully market and sell future
    products.

We have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities and
    have only a small staff with commercial capabilities. If we are
    unable to obtain those capabilities, either by developing our
    own organizations or entering into agreements with service
    providers, we will not be able to successfully sell any products
    that we may obtain regulatory approval for and bring to market
    in the future. In that event, we will not be able to generate
    significant revenue, even if our product candidates are
    approved. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the
    qualified sales and marketing personnel we need or that we will
    be able to enter into marketing or distribution agreements with
    third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all. Under the
    terms of our collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, we
    currently rely on sanofi-aventis for sales, marketing, and
    distribution of aflibercept in cancer indications, should it be
    approved in the future by regulatory authorities for marketing.
    We will have to rely on a third party or devote significant
    resources to develop our own sales, marketing, and distribution
    capabilities for our other product candidates, including the
    VEGF Trap-Eye in the United States, and we may be unsuccessful
    in developing our own sales, marketing, and distribution
    organization.


Even
    if our product candidates are approved for marketing, their
    commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors
    have received approval for products with the same mechanism of
    action, and competitors may get to the marketplace before we do
    with better or lower cost drugs or the market for our product
    candidates may be too small to support commercialization or
    sufficient profitability.

There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and
    pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
    and chemical companies. Many of our competitors have
    substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical product
    development and manufacturing capabilities, and financial,
    marketing, and human resources than we do. Our smaller
    competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they
    acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
    arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
    if we achieve product commercialization, our competitors have
    achieved, and may continue to achieve, product commercialization
    before our products are approved for marketing and sale.

Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
    Avastin

®

(Genentech), on the market for treating certain cancers and many
    different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working
    to develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, OSI
    Pharmaceuticals, and Pfizer. Many of these molecules are farther
    along in development than aflibercept and may offer competitive
    advantages over our molecule. Novartis has an ongoing Phase 3
    clinical development program evaluating an orally delivered VEGF
    tyrosine kinase inhibitor in different cancer settings. Each of
    Pfizer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals (together with its partner Bayer
    HealthCare) has received approval from the FDA to market and
    sell an oral medication that targets tumor cell growth and new
    vasculature formation that fuels the growth of tumors. The
    marketing approvals for Genentech’s VEGF antagonist,
    Avastin

®

(Genentech), and their extensive, ongoing clinical development
    plan for
    Avastin

®

(Genentech) in other cancer indications, make it more difficult
    for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to support
    aflibercept and to obtain regulatory approval of aflibercept in
    these cancer settings. This may delay or impair our ability to
    successfully develop and commercialize aflibercept. In addition,
    even if aflibercept is ever approved for sale for the treatment
    of certain cancers, it will be difficult for our drug to compete
    against
    Avastin

®

(Genentech) and the FDA approved kinase inhibitors, because
    doctors and patients will have significant experience using
    these medicines. In addition, an oral medication may be
    considerably less expensive for patients than a biologic
    medication, providing a competitive advantage to companies that
    market such products.

The market for eye disease products is also very competitive.
    Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the
    commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody
    fragment
    (Lucentis

®

)
    for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD)
    and other eye indications that was approved by the FDA in June
    2006. Many other companies are working on the development of
    product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD that
    act by blocking VEGF, VEGF receptors, and through the use of
    soluble ribonucleic acids (sRNAs) that modulate gene expression.
    In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label a third-party
    reformatted version of Genentech’s approved VEGF
    antagonist,
    Avastin

®

,
    with success for the treatment of wet AMD. The National Eye
    Institute recently has received funding for a Phase 3 trial to
    compare
    Lucentis

®

(Genentech) to
    Avastin

®

(Genentech) in the treatment of wet AMD. The marketing approval
    of
    Lucentis

®

(Genentech) and the potential off-label use of
    Avastin

®

(Genentech) make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in
    our clinical trials and successfully develop the VEGF Trap-Eye.
    Even if the VEGF Trap-Eye is ever approved for sale for the
    treatment of eye diseases, it may be difficult for our drug to
    compete against
    Lucentis

®

(Genentech), because doctors and patients will have significant
    experience using this medicine. Moreover, the relatively low
    cost of therapy with
    Avastin

®

(Genentech) in patients with wet AMD presents a further
    competitive challenge in this indication.

The availability of highly effective FDA approved
    TNF-antagonists such as
    Enbrel

®

(Immunex),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott), and the IL-1 receptor antagonist
    Kineret

®

(Amgen), and other marketed therapies makes it more difficult to
    successfully develop and commercialize
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    This is one of the reasons we discontinued the development of
    ARCALYST

TM

in adult rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, even if
    ARCALYST

TM

is ever approved for sale, it will be difficult for our drug to
    compete against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists in
    indications where both are useful because doctors and patients
    will have significant experience using these effective
    medicines. Moreover, in such indications these approved
    therapeutics may offer competitive advantages over
    ARCALYST

TM

,
    such as requiring fewer injections.


There are both small molecules and antibodies in development by
    other companies that are designed to block the synthesis of
    interleukin-1 or inhibit the signaling of interleukin-1. For
    example, Eli Lilly and Company, Xoma Ltd., and Novartis are each
    developing antibodies to interleukin-1 and Amgen is developing
    an antibody to the interleukin-1 receptor. Novartis has
    commenced advanced clinical testing of its IL-1 antibody in
    Muckle-Wells Syndrome, which is part of the group of rare
    genetic diseases called CAPS. Novartis’ IL-1 antibody and
    these other drug candidates could offer competitive advantages
    over
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    The successful development of these competing molecules could
    delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
    commercialize
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    For example, we may find it difficult to enroll patients in
    clinical trials for
    ARCALYST

TM

if the companies developing these competing interleukin-1
    inhibitors commence clinical trials in the same indications.

We are developing
    ARCALYST

TM

for the treatment of a group of rare diseases associated with
    mutations in the NLRP3 gene. These rare genetic disorders affect
    a small group of people, estimated to be in the hundreds. There
    may be too few patients with these genetic disorders to
    profitably commercialize
    ARCALYST

TM

in this indication.

We are developing REGN88 for the treatment of rheumatoid
    arthritis. The availability of highly effective FDA approved
    TNF-antagonists such as
    Enbrel

®

(Immunex),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott), and other marketed therapies makes it more difficult
    to successfully develop and commercialize REGN88. REGN88 is a
    human monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor.
    Roche is developing an antibody against the interleukin-6 (IL-6)
    receptor. Roche’s antibody has completed Phase 3 clinical
    trials and is the subject of a filed Biologics License
    Application with the FDA. Roche’s IL-6 receptor antibody,
    other clinical candidates in development, and drugs now or in
    the future on the market to treat rheumatoid arthritis could
    offer competitive advantages over REGN88. This could delay or
    impair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize
    REGN88.

The
    successful commercialization of our product candidates will
    depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these
    products from third-party payers and these payers may not agree
    to cover or reimburse for use of our products.

Our products, if commercialized, may be significantly more
    expensive than traditional drug treatments. Our future revenues
    and profitability will be adversely affected if United States
    and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and
    payers, and other third-party payers, including Medicare and
    Medicaid, do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our
    products to the patients. If these entities refuse to provide
    coverage and reimbursement with respect to our products or
    provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our
    products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and
    physicians may not prescribe them. Many third-party payers cover
    only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such
    payer more expensive for patients, and require prior
    authorization or failure on another type of treatment before
    covering a particular drug. Payers may especially impose these
    obstacles to coverage on higher-priced drugs, as our product
    candidates are likely to be.

We are seeking approval to market
    ARCALYST

TM

for the treatment of a group of rare genetic disorders called
    CAPS. There may be too few patients with CAPS to profitably
    commercialize
    ARCALYST

TM

.
    Physicians may not prescribe
    ARCALYST

TM

and CAPS patients may not be able to afford
    ARCALYST

TM

if third party payers do not agree to reimburse the cost of
    ARCALYST

TM

therapy and this would adversely affect our ability to
    commercialize
    ARCALYST

TM

profitably.

In addition to potential restrictions on coverage, the amount of
    reimbursement for our products may also reduce our
    profitability. In the United States, there have been, and we
    expect will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and
    reduce healthcare costs. Government and other third-party payers
    are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and
    increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage
    and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs.

Since our products, including
    ARCALYST

TM

,
    will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without
    health insurance coverage, if our products are unable to obtain
    adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers our
    ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may
    be adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of our products
    or any decrease in the price of our products will have a
    material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability.


In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage and level of
    reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental
    control, and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing,
    and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some
    foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be
    approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements
    governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For
    example, the European Union provides options for its member
    states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which
    their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement
    and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A
    member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal
    product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect
    controls on the profitability of the company placing the
    medicinal product on the market. Our results of operations may
    suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign
    countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in
    foreign countries is limited.

Risk
    Related to Employees

We are
    dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and
    retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and
    commercial organizations, our business will be
    harmed.

We are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers. If
    we are not able to retain any of these persons or our Chairman,
    our business may suffer. In particular, we depend on the
    services of P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., the Chairman of our board
    of directors, Leonard Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our
    President and Chief Executive Officer, George D.
    Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice
    President, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron
    Research Laboratories, and Neil Stahl, Ph.D., our Senior
    Vice President, Research and Development Sciences. There is
    intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified
    scientists and managerial personnel in the development,
    manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We may not be able
    to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel
    necessary for developing our business.

Risks
    Related to Our Common Stock

Our
    stock price is extremely volatile.

There has been significant volatility in our stock price and
    generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies’
    securities. Various factors and events may have a significant
    impact on the market price of our common stock. These factors
    include, by way of example:

•

progress, delays, or adverse results in clinical trials;

•

announcement of technological innovations or product candidates
    by us or competitors;

•

fluctuations in our operating results;

•

public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of our product
    candidates;

•

developments in our relationship with collaborative partners;

•

developments in the biotechnology industry or in government
    regulation of healthcare;

•

large sales of our common stock by our executive officers,
    directors, or significant shareholders;

•

arrivals and departures of key personnel; and

•

general market conditions.

The trading price of our Common Stock has been, and could
    continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to
    these and other factors, including the sale or attempted sale of
    a large amount of our Common Stock in the market. Broad market
    fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our
    Common Stock.

Future
    sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us
    may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise
    funds in new share offerings.

A small number of our shareholders beneficially own a
    substantial amount of our common stock. As of December 31,
    2007, our seven largest shareholders beneficially owned 54.0% of
    our outstanding shares of Common


Stock, assuming, in the case of Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D.
    Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, and P. Roy
    Vagelos, M.D., our Chairman, the conversion of their
    Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of all
    options held by them which are exercisable within 60 days
    of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007,
    sanofi-aventis beneficially owned 14,799,552 shares of
    Common Stock, representing approximately 19.3% of the shares of
    Common Stock then outstanding. Under our investor agreement with
    sanofi-aventis, sanofi-aventis may not sell these shares until
    December 20, 2012 except under limited circumstances and
    subject to earlier termination rights of these restrictions upon
    the occurrence of certain events. Notwithstanding these
    restrictions, if sanofi-aventis, or our other significant
    shareholders or we, sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock
    in the public market, or the perception that such sales may
    occur exists, the market price of our Common Stock could fall.
    Sales of Common Stock by our significant shareholders, including
    sanofi-aventis, also might make it more difficult for us to
    raise funds by selling equity or equity-related securities in
    the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.

Our
    existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence
    over matters requiring shareholder approval.

Holders of Class A Stock, who are generally the
    shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our
    initial public offering, are entitled to ten votes per share,
    while holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per
    share. As of December 31, 2007, holders of Class A
    Stock held 22.8% of the combined voting power of all of Common
    Stock and Class A Stock then outstanding. These
    shareholders, if acting together, would be in a position to
    significantly influence the election of our directors and to
    effect or prevent certain corporate transactions that require
    majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes,
    including mergers and other business combinations. This may
    result in our company taking corporate actions that you may not
    consider to be in your best interest and may affect the price of
    our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2007:

•

our current executive officers and directors beneficially owned
    12.6% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming
    conversion of their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the
    exercise of all options held by such persons which are
    exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2007, and
    27.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of
    Common Stock and Class A Stock, assuming the exercise of
    all options held by such persons which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2007; and

•

our seven largest shareholders beneficially owned 54.0% of our
    outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming, in the case of
    Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Executive
    Officer, and P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., our Chairman, the
    conversion of their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the
    exercise of all options held by them which are exercisable
    within 60 days of December 31, 2007. In addition,
    these seven shareholders held 58.0% of the combined voting power
    of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A
    Stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by our Chief
    Executive Officer and our Chairman which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2007.

Pursuant to an investor agreement, sanofi-aventis has agreed to
    vote its shares, at sanofi-aventis’ election, either as
    recommended by our board of directors or proportionally with the
    votes cast by our other shareholders, except with respect to
    certain change of control transactions, liquidation or
    dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding 10% of the
    then outstanding shares or voting rights of Common Stock and
    Class A Stock, and new equity compensation plans or
    amendments if not materially consistent with our historical
    equity compensation practices.

The
    anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and
    of New York corporate law and the contractual
    “standstill” provisions in our investor agreement with
    sanofi-aventis, could deter, delay, or prevent an acquisition or
    other “change in control” of us and could adversely
    affect the price of our Common Stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our
    by-laws and the New York Business Corporation Law contain
    various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or
    preventing a change in control of our company or our management
    that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. Some of
    these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it
    more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors
    and take


other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the
    price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for
    shares of our common stock. These provisions include:

•

authorization to issue “blank check” preferred stock,
    which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the
    board of directors without prior shareholder approval, with
    rights senior to those of our common shareholders;

•

a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three
    successive annual meetings to replace all of our directors;

•

a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for
    cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty
    percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for
    directors, as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the
    board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors;

•

any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of
    shareholders may be taken without a meeting, only if, prior to
    such action, all of our shareholders consent, the effect of
    which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at
    a duly convened meeting;

•

any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual
    meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this
    intention in writing and meet various other
    requirements; and

•

under the New York Business Corporation Law, in addition to
    certain restrictions which may apply to “business
    combinations” involving the Company and an “interested
    shareholder”, a plan of merger or consolidation of the
    Company must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all
    outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. See the risk factor
    immediately above captioned

“Our existing shareholders
    may be able to exert significant influence over matters
    requiring shareholder approval.”

Until the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or
    earlier termination of our antibody collaboration agreements
    with sanofi-aventis or our aflibercept collaboration with
    sanofi-aventis, sanofi-aventis will be bound by certain
    “standstill” provisions, which contractually prohibit
    sanofi-aventis from acquiring more than certain specified
    percentages of the Company’s Class A Stock and Common
    Stock (taken together) or otherwise seeking to obtain control of
    the Company.

In addition, we have a Change in Control Severance Plan and our
    chief executive officer has an employment agreement that
    provides severance benefits in the event our officers are
    terminated as a result of a change in control of the Company.
    Many of our stock options issued under our 2000 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan may become fully vested in connection with a
    “change in control” of our company, as defined in the
    plan.

Properties

We conduct our research, development, manufacturing, and
    administrative activities at our owned and leased facilities. We
    currently lease approximately 232,000 square feet of
    laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York under
    operating lease agreements. In December 2006, we entered into a
    new operating lease agreement for approximately
    221,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at the
    Company’s current Tarrytown location. The new lease
    includes approximately 27,000 square feet that we currently
    occupy (the “retained facilities”) and approximately
    194,000 square feet to be located in new facilities that
    are under construction and expected to be completed in mid-2009.
    In October 2007, we amended the December 2006 operating lease
    agreement to increase the amount of new space we will lease from
    approximately 194,000 square feet to approximately
    230,000 square feet, for an amended total under the new
    lease of approximately 257,000 square feet. The term of the
    lease is expected to commence in mid-2008 and will expire
    approximately 16 years later. Under the new lease we also
    have various options and rights on additional space at the
    Tarrytown site, and will continue to lease our present
    facilities until the new facilities are ready for occupancy. In
    addition, the lease contains three renewal options to extend the
    term of the lease by five years each and early termination
    options for our retained facilities only. The lease provides


for monthly payments over the term of the lease related to our
    retained facilities, the costs of construction and tenant
    improvements for our new facilities, and additional charges for
    utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.

In November 2007 we entered into a new operating sublease for
    approximately 10,000 square feet of office space in
    Tarrytown, New York. The lease expires in September 2009 and we
    have the option to extend the term for two additional terms of
    three months each.

We own a facility in Rensselaer, New York, consisting of two
    buildings totaling approximately 123,500 square feet of
    research, manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. In June
    2007, we exercised a purchase option on a 272,000 square
    foot building in Rensselaer, New York. Prior to the purchase,
    which was completed in October 2007, the Company leased
    approximately 75,000 square feet of manufacturing, office,
    and warehouse space in that building.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and
    intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the
    treatment of serious medical conditions. We currently have four
    clinical development programs, including three late-stage
    clinical programs:
    ARCALYST

tm

(rilonacept; also known as IL-1 Trap) in various inflammatory
    indications, aflibercept (VEGF Trap) in oncology, and the VEGF
    Trap-Eye formulation in eye diseases using intraocular delivery.
    Aflibercept is being developed in oncology in collaboration with
    sanofi-aventis. The VEGF Trap-Eye is being developed in
    collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC. Our fourth clinical
    development program is REGN88, an antibody to the Interleukin-6
    receptor (IL-6R) that entered clinical development in patients
    with rheumatoid arthritis in the fourth quarter of 2007. We
    expect that our next generation of product candidates will be
    based on our proprietary technologies for developing human
    monoclonal antibodies. Our antibody program is being conducted
    in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our preclinical research
    programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis,
    ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases
    and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and
    cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases.

Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant
    risk and expense. Since inception we have not generated any
    sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
    product candidates and we may never receive such revenues.
    Before revenues from the commercialization of our product
    candidates can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must
    overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully
    completing research and development and obtaining regulatory
    approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other
    countries. In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
    industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new
    developments may render our products and technologies
    uncompetitive or obsolete.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
    2007, we had a cumulative loss of $793.2 million. In the
    absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product
    candidates or other sources, the amount, timing, nature, and
    source of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue as
    we conduct our research and development activities. We expect to
    incur substantial losses over the next several years as we
    continue the clinical development of the VEGF Trap-Eye and
    ARCALYST

tm

;
    advance new product candidates into clinical development from
    our existing research programs utilizing our technology for
    designing fully human monoclonal antibodies; continue our
    research and development programs; and commercialize product
    candidates that receive regulatory approval, if any. Also, our
    activities may expand over time and require additional
    resources, and we expect our operating losses to be substantial
    over at least the next several years. Our losses may fluctuate
    from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors,
    the progress of our research and development efforts, the timing
    of certain expenses, and the amount and timing of payments that
    we receive from collaborators.

As a company that does not expect to be profitable over the next
    several years, management of cash flow is extremely important.
    The most significant use of our cash is for research and
    development activities, which include drug discovery,
    preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the manufacture of
    drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials. We
    are reimbursed for some of these research and development
    activities by our collaborators. Our principal sources of cash
    to-date have been from sales of common equity and convertible
    debt and from funding from our collaborators in the form of
    up-front payments, research progress payments, and payments for
    our research and development activities.

In 2007, our research and development expenses totaled
    $201.6 million. In 2008, we expect these expenses to
    increase substantially as we (i) expand our research and
    preclinical and clinical development activities in connection
    with our new antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis,
    (ii) expand our Phase 3 VEGF Trap-Eye clinical program and
    our
    ARCALYST

tm

and aflibercept clinical programs, and (iii) increase our
    research and development headcount. Due to our new antibody
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis, we expect a greater
    proportion of our research and development expenses to be funded
    by our collaborators in 2008 than in 2007.

A primary driver of our expenses is our number of full-time
    employees. Our annual average headcount in 2007 was 627 compared
    with 573 in 2006 and 696 in 2005. In 2007 our average headcount
    increased primarily to support our expanded development programs
    for the VEGF Trap-Eye and
    ARCALYST

tm

and our plans to move our first antibody candidate into clinical
    trials. In 2006, our average headcount decreased primarily as a
    result of reductions


made in the fourth quarter of 2005 and mid-year in 2006. These
    workforce reductions were associated with narrowing the focus of
    our research and development efforts, substantial improvements
    in manufacturing productivity, the June 2005 expiration of our
    collaboration with Procter & Gamble, and the
    completion of contract manufacturing for Merck in October 2006.
    In 2008, we expect our average headcount to increase to
    approximately 825-875 primarily to support the expansion of our
    research and development activities as described above,
    especially in connection with our new antibody collaboration
    with sanofi-aventis.

The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs
    are significant factors that can affect our operating and
    financial results. In our clinical programs, key events in 2007
    and plans for 2008 are as follows:

Collaborations

Our current collaboration agreements with sanofi-aventis and
    Bayer HealthCare, and our expired agreement with The
    Procter & Gamble Company, are summarized below.

The
    sanofi-aventis Group

Aflibercept

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
    with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to sanofi-aventis
    U.S.) to collaborate on the development and commercialization of
    aflibercept in all countries other than Japan, where we retained
    the exclusive right to develop and commercialize aflibercept.
    Sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable, up-front payment of
    $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued
    unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration
    agreement to exclude, from the scope of the collaboration, the
    development and commercialization of aflibercept for intraocular
    delivery to the eye. In connection with this amendment,
    sanofi-aventis made a $25.0 million non-refundable payment
    to us.

In December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our
    collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the
    companies are collaborating on the development of aflibercept to
    include Japan. In connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis
    agreed to make a $25.0 million non-refundable, up-front
    payment to us, which was received in January 2006. Under the
    collaboration agreement, as amended, we and sanofi-aventis will
    share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of
    aflibercept outside of Japan for disease indications included in
    our collaboration. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty of
    approximately 35% on annual sales of aflibercept. We may also
    receive up to $400.0 million in milestone payments upon
    receipt of specified marketing approvals. This total includes up
    to $360.0 million in milestone payments related to the
    receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight aflibercept
    oncology and other indications in the United States or the
    European Union. Another $40.0 million of milestone payments
    relate to receipt of marketing approvals for up to five
    aflibercept oncology indications in Japan.

We have agreed to manufacture clinical supplies of aflibercept
    at our plant in Rensselaer, New York. Sanofi-aventis has agreed
    to be responsible for providing commercial scale manufacturing
    capacity for aflibercept.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon
    worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during
    the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If
    the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of aflibercept development
    expenses, including 50% of the $25.0 million payment
    received in connection with the January 2005 amendment to our
    collaboration agreement, in accordance with a formula based on
    the amount of development expenses and our share of the
    collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate
    at our option. Since inception of the collaboration through
    December 31, 2007, we and sanofi-aventis have incurred
    $306.8 million in agreed upon development expenses related
    to the aflibercept program. In addition, if the first commercial
    sale of an aflibercept product for intraocular delivery to the
    eye predates the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product
    under the collaboration by two years, we will begin reimbursing
    sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of aflibercept
    development expenses in accordance with a formula until the
    first commercial aflibercept sale under the collaboration occurs.


Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of aflibercept
    development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
    rights to aflibercept.

Antibodies

In November 2007, we and sanofi-aventis entered into a global,
    strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize
    fully human monoclonal antibodies. The first therapeutic
    antibody to enter clinical development under the collaboration,
    REGN88, is an antibody to the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R),
    which has started clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis. The
    second is expected to be an antibody to Delta-like ligand-4
    (Dll4), which is currently slated to enter clinical development
    in mid-2008.

The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical
    Development Agreement and a License and Collaboration Agreement.
    We received a non-refundable, up-front payment of
    $85.0 million from sanofi-aventis under the discovery
    agreement. In addition, sanofi-aventis will fund up to
    $475.0 million of our research for identifying and
    validating potential drug discovery targets and developing fully
    human monoclonal antibodies against such targets through
    December 31, 2012, subject to specified funding limits of
    $75.0 million for the period from the collaboration’s
    inception through December 31, 2008, and
    $100.0 million annually in each of the next four years. The
    discovery agreement will expire on December 31, 2012;
    however, sanofi-aventis has an option to extend the agreement
    for up to an additional three years for further antibody
    development and preclinical activities. We will lead the design
    and conduct of research activities, including target
    identification and validation, antibody development, research
    and preclinical activities through filing of an Investigational
    New Drug Application, toxicology studies, and manufacture of
    preclinical and clinical supplies.

For each drug candidate identified under the discovery
    agreement, sanofi-aventis has the option to license rights to
    the candidate under the license agreement. If it elects to do
    so, sanofi-aventis will co-develop the drug candidate with us
    through product approval. Under the license agreement, agreed
    upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies
    during the term of the agreement will be funded by
    sanofi-aventis, except that following receipt of the first
    positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug
    candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug
    candidate (called Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs) will be shared 80%
    by sanofi-aventis and 20% by us. If the collaboration becomes
    profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for
    50% of development expenses that were fully funded by
    sanofi-aventis (or half of $0.7 million as of
    December 31, 2007) and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial
    Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts
    of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits
    from commercialization of collaboration products. If
    sanofi-aventis does not exercise its option to license rights to
    a particular drug candidate under the license agreement, we will
    retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such
    drug candidate, and sanofi-aventis will receive a royalty on
    sales, if any.

Sanofi-aventis will lead commercialization activities for
    products developed under the license agreement, subject to our
    right to co-promote such products. The parties will equally
    share profits and losses from sales within the United States.
    The parties will share profits outside the United States on a
    sliding scale based on sales starting at 65%
    (sanofi-aventis)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45%
    (us), and losses outside the United States at 55%
    (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us). In addition to profit sharing, we are
    entitled to receive up to $250.0 million in sales milestone
    payments, with milestone payments commencing only if and after
    aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed
    $1.0 billion on a rolling

12-month

basis.

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
    supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the
    collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate
    are being manufactured.

With respect to each antibody product which enters development
    under the license agreement, sanofi-aventis or we may, by giving
    twelve months notice, opt-out of further development

and/or

commercialization of the product, in which event the other party
    retains exclusive rights to continue the development

and/or

commercialization of the product. We may also opt-out of the
    further development of an antibody product if we give notice to
    sanofi-aventis within thirty days of the date that
    sanofi-aventis enters joint development of such antibody product
    under the license agreement. Each of the discovery agreement and
    the license agreement contains other termination provisions,
    including for material breach by the other party and, in the
    case of the discovery agreement, a


termination right for sanofi-aventis under certain
    circumstances, including if certain minimal criteria for the
    discovery program are not achieved. Prior to December 31,
    2012, sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the discovery
    agreement without cause with at least three months advance
    written notice; however, except under defined circumstances,
    sanofi-aventis would be obligated to immediately pay to us the
    full amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term
    of the research agreement through December 31, 2012. Upon
    termination of the collaboration in its entirety, our obligation
    to reimburse sanofi-aventis for development costs out of any
    future profits from collaboration products will terminate.

In December 2007, we sold sanofi-aventis 12 million newly
    issued, unregistered shares of Common Stock at an aggregate cash
    price of $312.0 million, or $26.00 per share of Common
    Stock. As a condition to the closing of this transaction,
    sanofi-aventis entered into an investor agreement with us. Under
    the investor agreement, sanofi-aventis has three demand rights
    to require us to use all reasonable efforts to conduct a
    registered underwritten public offering with respect to shares
    of the Common Stock beneficially owned by sanofi-aventis
    immediately after the closing of the transaction. Until the
    later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier
    termination of the license and collaboration agreement and the
    existing collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis for the
    development and commercialization of aflibercept, sanofi-aventis
    will be bound by certain “standstill” provisions.
    These provisions include an agreement not to acquire more than a
    specified percentage of the outstanding shares of Class A
    Stock and Common Stock. The percentage is currently 25% and will
    increase to 30% after December 20, 2011. Sanofi-aventis has
    also agreed not to dispose of any shares of Common Stock that
    were beneficially owned by sanofi-aventis immediately after the
    closing of the transaction until December 20, 2012, subject
    to certain limited exceptions. Following December 20, 2012,
    sanofi-aventis will be permitted to sell shares of Common Stock
    (i) in a registered underwritten public offering undertaken
    pursuant to the demand registration rights granted to sanofi-
    aventis and described above, subject to the underwriter’s
    broad distribution of securities sold, (ii) pursuant to
    Rule 144 under the Securities Act and transactions exempt
    from registration under the Securities Act, subject to a volume
    limitation of one million shares of Common Stock every three
    months and a prohibition on selling to beneficial owners, or
    persons that would become beneficial owners as a result of such
    sale, of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
    and (iii) into an issuer tender offer, or a tender offer by
    a third party that is recommended or not opposed by our Board of
    Directors. Sanofi-aventis has agreed to vote, and cause its
    affiliates to vote, all shares of our voting securities they are
    entitled to vote, at sanofi-aventis’ election, either as
    recommended by our Board of Directors or proportionally with the
    votes cast by our other shareholders, except with respect to
    certain change of control transactions, liquidation or
    dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding 10% of the
    then outstanding shares or voting rights of Common Shares, and
    new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially
    consistent with our historical equity compensation practices.
    The rights and restrictions under the investor agreement are
    subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain events.

Bayer
    HealthCare LLC

In October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration
    agreement with Bayer HealthCare to globally develop, and
    commercialize outside the United States, the VEGF Trap-Eye.
    Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer HealthCare made a
    non-refundable, up-front payment to us of $75.0 million. In
    August 2007, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment
    from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in
    the Phase 3 study of the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD, and are
    eligible to receive up to $90.0 million in additional
    development and regulatory milestones related to the VEGF
    Trap-Eye program. We are also eligible to receive up to an
    additional $135.0 million in sales milestones when and if
    total annual sales of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United
    States achieve certain specified levels starting at
    $200.0 million.

We will share equally with Bayer HealthCare in any future
    profits arising from the commercialization of the VEGF Trap-Eye
    outside the United States. If the VEGF Trap-Eye is granted
    marketing authorization in a major market country outside the
    United States and the collaboration becomes profitable, we will
    be obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare out of our share of
    the collaboration profits for 50% of the agreed upon development
    expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred (or half of
    $25.4 million at December 31, 2007) in accordance
    with a formula based on the amount of development expenses that
    Bayer HealthCare has incurred and our share of the collaboration
    profits, or at a faster rate at our option. Within the United
    States, we are responsible for any future commercialization of
    the VEGF Trap-Eye and retain exclusive rights to any future
    profits from commercialization.


Agreed upon development expenses incurred by both companies in
    2007 under a global development plan were shared as follows: The
    first $50.0 million was shared equally and we were solely
    responsible for up to the next $40.0 million. Neither party
    was reimbursed for any development expenses that it incurred
    prior to 2007.

In 2008, agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred
    by both companies under a global development plan will be shared
    as follows: Up to the first $70.0 million will be shared
    equally, we are solely responsible for up to the next
    $30.0 million, and over $100.0 million will be shared
    equally. In 2009 and thereafter, all development expenses will
    be shared equally. We are also obligated to use commercially
    reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial product
    requirements.

Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate the agreement
    without cause with at least six months or twelve months advance
    notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of
    termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for
    any reason, we retain all rights to the VEGF Trap-Eye.

For the period from the collaboration’s inception in
    October 2006 through September 30, 2007, all up-front
    licensing, milestone, and cost-sharing payments received or
    receivable from Bayer HealthCare had been fully deferred and
    included in deferred revenue for financial statement purposes.
    In the fourth quarter of 2007, we and Bayer HealthCare approved
    a global development plan for the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. The
    plan includes estimated development steps, timelines, and costs,
    as well as the projected responsibilities of each of the
    companies. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we and
    Bayer HealthCare reaffirmed the companies’ commitment to a
    DME development program and had initial estimates of development
    costs for the VEGF Trap-Eye in DME. As a result, effective in
    the fourth quarter of 2007, we determined the appropriate
    accounting policy for payments from Bayer HealthCare and
    cost-sharing of our and Bayer HealthCare’s VEGF Trap-Eye
    development expenses, and the financial statement
    classifications and periods in which past and future payments
    from Bayer HealthCare (including the $75.0 million up-front
    payment and development and regulatory milestone payments) and
    cost-sharing of VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses will be
    recognized in our Statement of Operations.

The
    Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, we entered into a long-term collaboration with
    Procter & Gamble to discover, develop, and
    commercialize pharmaceutical products, and Procter &
    Gamble agreed to provide funding in support of our research
    efforts related to the collaboration. In accordance with the
    companies’ collaboration agreement, Procter &
    Gamble was obligated to fund our research on therapeutic areas
    that were of particular interest to Procter & Gamble
    through December 2005, with no further research obligations by
    either party thereafter. Under the collaboration agreement,
    research support from Procter & Gamble was
    $2.5 million per quarter, plus annual adjustments for
    inflation, through December 2005.

In June 2005, we and Procter & Gamble amended our
    collaboration agreement. Under the terms of the modified
    agreement, the two companies agreed that the research activities
    being pursued under the collaboration agreement were completed
    on June 30, 2005, six months prior to the December 31,
    2005 expiration date in the collaboration agreement.
    Procter & Gamble agreed to make a one-time
    $5.6 million payment to Regeneron, which was received in
    July 2005, and to fund our research under the agreement through
    the second quarter of 2005. We agreed to pay Procter &
    Gamble approximately $1.0 million to acquire certain
    capital equipment owned by Procter & Gamble and
    located at our facilities. We and Procter & Gamble
    divided rights to research programs and preclinical product
    candidates that were developed during the research term of the
    collaboration. Neither party has the right to participate in the
    development or commercialization of the other party’s
    product candidates. We are entitled to receive royalties based
    on any future product sales of a Procter & Gamble
    preclinical candidate arising from the collaboration, and
    Procter & Gamble is entitled to receive a small
    royalty on any sales of a single Regeneron candidate that is not
    currently being developed. Neither party is entitled to receive
    either royalties or other payments based on any other products
    arising from the collaboration.


Other
    Agreements

AstraZeneca

In February 2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license
    agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited that allows AstraZeneca to
    utilize our

VelocImmune

technology in its internal
    research programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under
    the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca made a
    $20.0 million non-refundable, up-front payment to us.
    AstraZeneca is required to make up to five additional annual
    payments of $20.0 million, subject to its ability to
    terminate the agreement after making the first three additional
    payments or earlier if the technology does not meet minimum
    performance criteria. We are entitled to receive a
    mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
    products discovered by AstraZeneca using our

VelocImmune

technology.

Astellas

In March 2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement
    with Astellas Pharma Inc. that allows Astellas to utilize our

VelocImmune

technology in its internal research programs
    to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the
    agreement, Astellas made a $20.0 million non-refundable,
    up-front payment to us. Astellas is required to make up to five
    additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to its
    ability to terminate the agreement after making the first three
    additional payments or earlier if the technology does not meet
    minimum performance criteria. We are entitled to receive a
    mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
    products discovered by Astellas using our

VelocImmune

technology.

National
    Institutes of Health

In September 2006, we were awarded a five-year grant from the
    National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the NIH’s
    Knockout Mouse Project. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Project
    is to build a comprehensive and broadly available resource of
    knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function
    and human diseases. We use our

VelociGene

®

technology to take aim at 3,500 of the most difficult genes to
    target and which are not currently the focus of other
    large-scale knockout mouse programs. We also agreed to grant a
    limited license to a consortium of research institutions, the
    other major participants in the Knockout Mouse Project, to use
    components of our

VelociGene

technology in the Knockout
    Mouse Project. We are generating a collection of targeting
    vectors and targeted mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells)
    which can be used to produce knockout mice. These materials will
    be made widely available to academic researchers without charge.
    We will receive a fee for each targeted ES cell line or
    targeting construct made by us or the research consortium and
    transferred to commercial entities.

Under the NIH grant, we are entitled to receive a minimum of
    $17.9 million over a five-year period. We will receive
    another $1.0 million to optimize our existing C57BL/6 ES
    cell line and its proprietary growth medium, both of which will
    be supplied to the research consortium for its use in the
    Knockout Mouse Project. We have the right to use, for any
    purpose, all materials generated by us and the research
    consortium.

Accounting
    for Stock-based Employee Compensation

Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value based
    method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. (SFAS) 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
    using the modified prospective method as described in
    SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

. As a
    result, in 2005, we recognized compensation expense, in an
    amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments
    (including stock option awards) on their date of grant, over the
    vesting period of the awards using graded vesting, which is an
    accelerated expense recognition method. Under the modified
    prospective method, compensation expense for Regeneron is
    recognized for (a) all share based payments granted on or
    after January 1, 2005 and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date. Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, we
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. (APB) 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations. Therefore,
    compensation expense related to employee stock options was not
    reflected in operating expenses in any period prior to the first
    quarter of 2005 and prior period operating results were not
    restated.


Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which is a revision
    of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting
    for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
    share-based payment transactions, and requires the recognition
    of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of
    the share-based payment (including stock options and restricted
    stock) issued to employees. SFAS 123R requires companies to
    estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited
    at the time of grant and to revise this estimate, if necessary,
    in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Effective January 1, 2005, and prior to our
    adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized the effect of
    forfeitures in stock-based compensation cost in the period when
    they occurred, in accordance with SFAS 123. Upon adoption
    of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, we were
    required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the
    effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards
    that were not expected to vest as of the SFAS 123R adoption
    date. This adjustment reduced our loss by $0.8 million and
    is included in our operating results for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as a cumulative-effect adjustment of a
    change in accounting principle. Exclusive of the
    cumulative-effect adjustment, the effect of the change from
    applying the provisions of SFAS 123 to applying the
    provisions of SFAS 123R on our loss from operations, net
    loss, and net loss per share for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was not significant, and there was no
    impact to our cash flows for the year ended December 31,
    2006.

Non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense related to
    stock option awards (Stock Option Expense) recognized in
    operating expenses totaled $28.0 million,
    $18.4 million, and $19.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In
    addition, for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    $0.1 million of Stock Option Expense was capitalized into
    inventory. As of December 31, 2007, there was
    $60.6 million of stock-based compensation cost related to
    outstanding nonvested stock options, net of estimated
    forfeitures, which had not yet been recognized in operating
    expenses. We expect to recognize this compensation cost over a
    weighted-average period of 1.8 years. In addition, there
    are 723,092 options which are unvested as of December 31,
    2007 and would become vested upon our products achieving certain
    sales targets and the optionee satisfying certain service
    conditions. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant
    date, related to these performance options totals
    $2.7 million and will begin to be recognized only if, and
    when, these options’ performance condition is considered to
    be probable of attainment.

Assumptions

We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
    each option granted under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Using this model, fair value is
    calculated based on assumptions with respect to
    (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of our board of directors are expected to hold their options
    prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend
    yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
    rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
    securities with maturities approximating the options’
    expected lives. Expected volatility has been estimated based on
    actual movements in our stock price over the most recent
    historical periods equivalent to the options’ expected
    lives. Expected lives are principally based on our limited
    historical exercise experience with option grants with similar
    exercise prices. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have
    never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any
    in the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes the
    weighted average values of the assumptions we used in computing
    the fair value of option grants during 2007, 2006, and 2005:

Changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the

    stock-based compensation recognized in any period.

    development revenue from sanofi-aventis which, as detailed
    below, consists partly of reimbursement for research and
    development expenses and partly of the recognition of revenue
    related to non-refundable, up-front payments of
    $105.0 million related to the aflibercept collaboration and
    $85.0 million related to the antibody collaboration.
    Non-refundable, up-front payments are recorded as deferred
    revenue and recognized over the period over which we are
    obligated to perform services. We estimate our performance
    periods based on the specific terms of the collaboration
    agreements, and adjust the performance periods, if appropriate,
    based on the applicable facts and circumstances.

Sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron’s
    aflibercept expenses increased in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily due to higher preclinical and clinical development
    costs. Recognition of deferred revenue related to
    sanofi-aventis’ up-front aflibercept payments decreased in
    2007 from 2006 due to an extension of the estimated performance
    period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized. As
    of December 31, 2007, $61.2 million


of the original $105.0 million of up-front payments related
    to aflibercept was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in
    future periods.

In 2007, sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron’s
    antibody expenses consisted of $3.0 million under the
    collaboration’s discovery agreement and $0.7 million
    of REGN88 development costs under the license agreement.
    Recognition of deferred revenue under the antibody collaboration
    related to sanofi-aventis’ $85.0 million up-front
    payment. As of December 31, 2007, $84.1 million of
    this up-front payment was deferred and will be recognized as
    revenue in future periods.

As described above, effective in the fourth quarter of 2007, the
    Company determined the appropriate accounting policy for
    payments from Bayer HealthCare. The $75.0 million up-front
    licensing payment and the $20.0 million milestone payment
    (which was received in August 2007 and not considered
    substantive) from Bayer HealthCare are being recognized as
    contract research and development revenue over the related
    estimated performance period in accordance with SAB 104 and

EITF 00-21.

In periods when we recognize VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses
    that we incur under the collaboration, we also recognize, as
    contract research and development revenue, the portion of those
    VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable from
    Bayer HealthCare. In periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs agreed
    upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that benefit the
    collaboration and Regeneron, we also recognize, as additional
    research and development expense, the portion of Bayer
    HealthCare’s VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are
    obligated to reimburse. In the fourth quarter of 2007, when we
    commenced recognizing previously deferred payments from Bayer
    HealthCare and cost-sharing of our and Bayer HealthCare’s
    2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, we recognized, as a
    cumulative catch-up, contract research and development revenue
    of $35.9 million, consisting of (i) $15.9 million
    related to the $75.0 million up-front licensing payment and
    the $20.0 million milestone payment, and
    (ii) $20.0 million related to the portion of our 2007
    VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is reimbursable from
    Bayer HealthCare. As of December 31, 2007,
    $79.1 million of the up-front licensing and milestone
    payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in
    future periods.

Other contract research and development revenue includes
    $5.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively,
    recognized in connection with our five-year grant from the NIH,
    which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the
    NIH’s Knockout Mouse Project.

Contract manufacturing revenue in 2006 related to our long-term
    agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., which expired in
    October 2006, to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our
    Rensselaer, New York facility. Revenue and the related
    manufacturing expense were recognized as product was shipped,
    after acceptance by Merck. Included in contract manufacturing
    revenue in 2006 was $1.2 million of deferred revenue
    associated with capital improvement reimbursements paid by Merck
    prior to commencement of production. We do not expect to receive
    any further contract manufacturing revenue from Merck.

In connection with our license agreement with AstraZeneca, as
    described above, the $20.0 million non-refundable, up-front
    payment, which we received in February 2007, was deferred and is
    being recognized as revenue ratably over the twelve month period
    beginning in February 2007. In connection with our license
    agreement with Astellas, as described above, the
    $20.0 million non-refundable, up-front payment, which we
    received in April 2007, was deferred and is being recognized as
    revenue ratably over the twelve month period beginning in June
    2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized
    $28.4 million of technology licensing revenue related to
    these agreements.


Expenses:

Total operating expenses increased to $239.5 million in
    2007 from $171.1 million in 2006. Our average employee
    headcount in 2007 increased to 627 from 573 in 2006, primarily
    to support our expanded development programs for the VEGF
    Trap-Eye and
    ARCALYST

tm

and our activities to move our first antibody candidate (REGN88)
    into clinical trials. Operating expenses in 2007 and 2006
    include a total of $28.0 million and $18.4 million of
    Stock Option Expense, respectively, as detailed below:

    in comparison to the fair market value of our Common Stock on
    the dates of annual employee option grants made in recent prior
    years.

Research
    and Development Expenses:

    $1.8 million of Stock Option Expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(3)

Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when
    Bayer HealthCare incurs VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, we
    also recognize, as additional research and development expense,
    the portion of their VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we
    are obligated to reimburse. In the fourth quarter of 2007, when
    we commenced recognizing cost-sharing of our and Bayer
    HealthCare’s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, we
    recognized as additional research and development expense a
    cumulative catch-up of $10.6 million of VEGF Trap-Eye
    development expenses that we were obligated to reimburse to
    Bayer HealthCare.

Payroll and benefits increased primarily due to the increase in
    employee headcount, as described above, annual compensation
    increases effective in 2007, and higher Stock Option Expense, as
    described above. Clinical trial expenses increased due primarily
    to higher costs related to our Phase 3 study of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in wet AMD, which we initiated in the third quarter of
    2007, and our ongoing Phase 1 and 2 studies of the VEGF Trap-Eye
    in wet AMD. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily
    to higher costs related to manufacturing
    ARCALYST

tm

and preclinical and clinical supplies of REGN88, which were
    partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing
    aflibercept and the VEGF Trap-Eye. Research and preclinical
    development costs increased primarily due to higher costs
    related to our human monoclonal antibody programs, including
    REGN88, and utilization of our proprietary technology platforms.
    Occupancy and other operating costs primarily increased in
    connection with higher Company headcount and to support our
    expanded research and development activities.

We budget our research and development costs by expense
    category, rather than by project. We also prepare estimates of
    research and development cost for projects in clinical
    development, which include direct costs and allocations of
    certain costs such as indirect labor, Stock Option Expense, and
    manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit
    multiple projects, and, under our collaboration with Bayer
    HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s VEGF Trap-Eye
    development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our
    estimates of research and development costs for clinical
    development programs are shown below:

Drug development and approval in the United States is a
    multi-step process regulated by the FDA. The process begins with
    discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the
    submission of an IND to the FDA which, if successful, allows the
    opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of the
    potential new drug. Clinical development typically involves
    three phases of study: Phase 1, 2, and 3. The most significant
    costs in clinical development are in Phase 3 clinical trials, as
    they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug
    development process. Following successful completion of Phase 3
    clinical trials for a biological product, a biologics license
    application (or BLA) must be submitted to, and accepted by, the
    FDA, and the FDA must approve the BLA prior to commercialization
    of the drug. It is not uncommon for the FDA to request
    additional data following its review of a BLA, which can
    significantly increase the drug development timeline and
    expenses. We may elect either on our own, or at the request of
    the FDA, to conduct further studies that are referred to as
    Phase 3B and 4 studies. Phase 3B studies are initiated and
    either completed or substantially completed while the BLA is
    under FDA review. These studies are conducted under an IND.
    Phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing studies, are
    studies that are initiated and conducted after the FDA has
    approved a product for marketing. In addition, as discovery
    research, preclinical development, and clinical programs
    progress, opportunities to expand development of drug candidates
    into new disease indications can emerge. We may elect to add
    such new disease indications to our development efforts (with
    the approval of our collaborator for joint development
    programs), thereby extending the period in


which we will be developing a product. For example, we, and our
    collaborators, where applicable, continue to explore further
    development of
    ARCALYST

tm

,
    aflibercept, and the VEGF Trap-Eye in different disease
    indications.

There are numerous uncertainties associated with drug
    development, including uncertainties related to safety and
    efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties
    related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials,
    changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive
    landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and
    uncertainties described in Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors” under “Risks Related to Development of Our
    Product Candidates,” “Regulatory and Litigation
    Risks,” and “Risks Related to Commercialization of
    Products.” The lengthy process of seeking FDA approvals,
    and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and
    regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources.
    Any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory
    approvals could materially adversely affect our business.

For these reasons and due to the variability in the costs
    necessary to develop a product and the uncertainties related to
    future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope
    of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental
    approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful
    estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to
    market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to
    reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate
    product revenues and material net cash inflows. In the second
    quarter of 2007, we submitted a BLA for
    ARCALYST

tm

for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare genetic disorders. We
    cannot predict whether or when the commercialization of
    ARCALYST

tm

in CAPS will result in a material net cash inflow to us.

Contract
    Manufacturing Expenses:

We had no contract manufacturing expenses in 2007 compared to
    $8.1 million in 2006, due to the expiration of our
    manufacturing agreement with Merck in October 2006.

General
    and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $37.9 million in 2007 from $25.9 million in the same
    period of 2006 primarily due to (i) higher Stock Option
    Expense, as described above, (ii) higher compensation
    expense principally due to annual increases effective in 2007
    and higher administrative headcount to support our expanded
    research and development activities, (iii) recruitment and
    related costs associated with expanding our headcount in 2007,
    (iv) higher fees for consultants and other professional
    services on various corporate matters, and (v) market
    research and related expenses incurred in 2007 in connection
    with our
    ARCALYST

tm

and VEGF Trap-Eye programs.

Other
    Income and Expense:

Investment income increased to $20.9 million in 2007 from
    $16.5 million in 2006, resulting primarily from higher
    balances of cash and marketable securities (due, in part, to the
    up-front payment received from Bayer HealthCare in October 2006,
    as described above, and the receipt of net proceeds from the
    November 2006 public offering of our Common Stock). This
    increase was partly offset by a $5.9 million charge in 2007
    related to marketable securities which we considered to be other
    than temporarily impaired in value. In the second half of 2007,
    deterioration in the credit quality of marketable securities
    from two issuers has subjected us to the risk of being unable to
    recover their full principal value, which totals
    $14.0 million. Interest expense was $12.0 million in
    2007 and 2006. Interest expense is attributable primarily to
    $200.0 million of convertible notes issued in October 2001,
    which mature in October 2008 and bear interest at 5.5% per annum.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005

Net
    Loss:

Regeneron reported a net loss of $102.3 million, or $1.77
    per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to a net loss of
    $95.4 million, or $1.71 per (basic and diluted) for 2005.

    $105.0 million of non-refundable, up-front payments
    received in 2003 and 2006. Non-refundable, up-front payments are
    recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the period over
    which we are obligated to perform services. We estimate our

Sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron aflibercept
    expenses increased in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to
    higher costs related to our manufacture of aflibercept clinical
    supplies during the first half of 2006. Recognition of deferred
    revenue related to sanofi-aventis’ up-front payments also
    increased in 2006 from the same period in 2005, due to our
    receipt in January 2006 of a $25.0 million non-refundable,
    up-front payment from sanofi-aventis related to the expansion of
    the companies’ aflibercept collaboration to include Japan.
    As of December 31, 2006, $70.0 million of the original
    $105.0 million of up-front payments was deferred and will
    be recognized as revenue in future periods.

Contract research and development revenue earned from
    Procter & Gamble decreased in 2006 compared to 2005,
    as the research activities being pursued under our December 2000
    collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble, as
    amended, were completed on June 30, 2005, as described
    above under “Collaborations — The
    Procter & Gamble Company.” Since the second
    quarter of 2005, we have not received, and do not expect to
    receive, any further contract research and development revenue
    from Procter & Gamble.

In October 2006 we entered into our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration
    with Bayer HealthCare. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we
    determined the appropriate accounting policy for payments from
    Bayer HealthCare and, in 2007, commenced recognizing previously
    deferred payments in our Statement of Operations through a
    cumulative

catch-up,

as
    described above. Accordingly, there was no contract research and
    development revenue earned from Bayer HealthCare in 2006. As of
    December 31, 2006, the $75.0 million up-front payment
    received from Bayer HealthCare in October 2006 was deferred and
    will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

Other contract research and development revenue includes
    $0.5 million recognized in connection with our NIH Grant,
    as described above.

Contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long-term
    agreement with Merck, which expired in October 2006, to
    manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our Rensselaer facility.
    Contract manufacturing revenue decreased in 2006 compared to
    2005 due to a decrease in product shipments to Merck in 2006.
    Revenue and the related


manufacturing expense were recognized as product was shipped,
    after acceptance by Merck. Included in contract manufacturing
    revenue in 2006 and 2005 were $1.2 million and
    $1.4 million, respectively, of deferred revenue associated
    with capital improvement reimbursements paid by Merck prior to
    commencement of production. We do not expect to receive any
    further contract manufacturing revenue from Merck and there was
    no Merck deferred revenue as of the end of 2006.

Expenses:

Total operating expenses decreased to $171.1 million in
    2006 from $190.6 million in 2005 due, in part, to our lower
    headcount, as described above. (Also see “Severance
    Costs” below.)

Operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 include a total of
    $18.4 million and $19.9 million of Stock Option
    Expense, respectively, as detailed below:

Research
    and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses decreased to
    $137.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $155.6 million for 2005. The following table
    summarizes the major categories of our research and development
    expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005:

    Includes $1.8 million and $1.4 million of Stock Option
    Expense for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.


Payroll and benefits decreased principally due to our lower
    headcount in 2006. In addition, payroll and benefits in 2006 and
    2005 included $0.4 million and $2.2 million,
    respectively, of severance costs associated with our workforce
    reduction plan that we initiated in October 2005. Clinical trial
    expenses decreased primarily due to lower
    ARCALYST

tm

costs in 2006 as we discontinued clinical development of
    ARCALYST

tm

in adult rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis in the second
    half of 2005. This decrease was partly offset by higher 2006
    VEGF Trap-Eye costs related to Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical
    trials that we are conducting in wet AMD. Clinical manufacturing
    costs decreased because of lower costs in 2006 related to
    manufacturing
    ARCALYST

tm

clinical supplies, which were partially offset by higher costs
    related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies. Research
    and preclinical development costs decreased principally because
    of lower costs for general research supplies in 2006 as we
    narrowed the focus of our research and development efforts due,
    in part, to the expiration of our collaboration with
    Procter & Gamble in June 2005, as described above.
    Occupancy and other operating costs decreased primarily due to
    our lower 2006 headcount and lower costs for utilities
    associated with our leased research facilities in Tarrytown, New
    York.

We budget our research and development costs by expense
    category, rather than by project. We also prepare estimates of
    research and development cost for projects in clinical
    development, which include direct costs and allocations of
    certain costs such as indirect labor, non-cash stock-based
    employee compensation expense related to stock option awards,
    and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that
    benefit multiple projects. Our estimates of research and
    development costs for clinical development programs are shown

For the reasons described above under “Research and
    Development Expenses” for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and due to the variability in the costs necessary
    to develop a product and the uncertainties related to future
    indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the
    projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental
    approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful
    estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to
    market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to
    reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate
    product revenues and material net cash inflows.

Contract
    Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses decreased to $8.1 million
    in 2006, compared to $9.6 million in 2005, primarily
    because we shipped less product to Merck in 2006.

General
    and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $25.9 million in 2006 from $25.4 million in the same
    period of 2005 as higher legal expenses related to general
    corporate matters and higher patent-and trademark-related costs
    were partly offset by lower professional fees for internal audit
    and other administrative advisory services and lower
    administrative facility costs.

Other
    Income and Expense:

In June 2005, we and Procter & Gamble amended our
    collaboration agreement and agreed that the research activities
    of both companies under the collaboration agreement were
    completed. In connection with the amendment, Procter &
    Gamble made a one-time $5.6 million payment to us, which we
    recognized as other contract income in 2005. In January 2005, we
    and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to
    exclude rights to


develop and commercialize aflibercept for intraocular delivery
    to the eye. In connection with the amendment, sanofi-aventis
    made a one-time $25.0 million payment to us, which we
    recognized as other contract income in 2005.

Investment income increased to $16.5 million in 2006 from
    $10.4 million in 2005, due primarily to higher balances of
    cash and marketable securities (due, in part, to the up-front
    payment received from Bayer HealthCare in October 2006, as
    described above, and the receipt of net proceeds from the
    November 2006 public offering of our Common Stock), as well as
    higher effective interest rates on investment securities in
    2006. Interest expense was $12.0 million in 2006 and 2005.
    Interest expense is attributable primarily to
    $200.0 million of convertible notes issued in October 2001,
    which mature in 2008 and bear interest at 5.5% per annum.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our operations
    primarily through offerings of our equity securities, a private
    placement of convertible debt, payments earned under our past
    and present research and development and contract manufacturing
    agreements, including our agreements with sanofi-aventis, Bayer
    HealthCare, and Merck, and investment income.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

At December 31, 2007, we had $846.3 million in cash,
    cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities
    compared with $522.9 million at December 31, 2006. In
    connection with our non-exclusive license agreements with
    AstraZeneca and Astellas, as described above, AstraZeneca and
    Astellas each made an up-front payment to us of
    $20.0 million in February and April 2007, respectively. In
    August 2007, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment
    from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in
    our Phase 3 study of the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. In December
    2007, we received an $85.0 million upfront payment in
    connection with our new collaboration with sanofi-aventis to
    discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal
    antibodies. Sanofi-aventis also purchased 12 million newly
    issued, unregistered shares of our Common Stock in December 2007
    for gross proceeds to us of $312.0 million.

Cash
    Provided by Operations:

Net cash provided by operations was $27.4 million in 2007
    and $23.1 million in 2006, and net cash used in operations
    was $30.3 million in 2005. Our net losses of
    $105.6 million in 2007, $102.3 million in 2006, and
    $95.4 million in 2005 included $28.1 million,
    $18.7 million, and $21.9 million, respectively, of
    non-cash stock-based employee compensation costs, consisting
    primarily of Stock Option Expense. Our net losses also included
    depreciation and amortization of $11.5 million,
    $14.6 million, and $15.5 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively, and a $5.9 million non-cash charge in
    2007 related to marketable securities which we considered to be
    other than temporarily impaired in value.

In 2007, end-of-year accounts receivable increased by
    $10.8 million compared to 2006 due to higher receivable
    balances related to our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and
    Bayer HealthCare. Also, prepaid expenses and other assets
    increased $9.6 million at December 31, 2007 compared
    to end-of-year 2006 due primarily to higher prepaid clinical
    trial costs. At December 31, 2007, our deferred revenue
    balances increased by $89.8 million, compared to
    end-of-year 2006, due primarily to (i) the
    $85.0 million up-front payment received from
    sanofi-aventis, (ii) the $20.0 million milestone
    payment from Bayer HealthCare which was deemed to be
    non-substantive and fully deferred, and (iii) the two
    $20.0 million up-front payments received from each of
    AstraZeneca and Astellas, all as described above, partly offset
    by 2007 revenue recognition, principally from these deferred
    payments and prior year deferred payments from sanofi-aventis
    and Bayer HealthCare, in our Statement of Operations. Accounts
    payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased
    $18.2 million at December 31, 2007 compared to
    end-of-year 2006 primarily due to a $4.9 million
    cost-sharing payment due to Bayer Healthcare in connection with
    the companies’ VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration and higher
    accruals in 2007 for payroll costs and clinical-related expenses.

In 2006, end-of-year accounts receivable balances decreased by
    $29.0 million compared to 2005, due to the January 2006
    receipt of a $25.0 million up-front payment from
    sanofi-aventis, which was receivable at December 31, 2005,
    in connection with an amendment to our aflibercept collaboration
    to include Japan, and lower amounts due from sanofi aventis for
    reimbursement of aflibercept development expenses. Also, our
    deferred revenue balances at December 31, 2006 increased by
    $60.8 million compared to end-of-year 2005, due primarily
    to the October 2006 $75.0 million up-front payment from
    Bayer, as described above, partly offset by 2006 revenue


recognition from deferred sanofi-aventis up-front payments. In
    2005, our deferred revenue balances increased by
    $14.5 million compared to 2004, due primarily to the
    January 2006 $25.0 million up-front payment from
    sanofi-aventis, which was receivable at December 31, 2005,
    partly offset by 2005 revenue recognition from deferred
    sanofi-aventis up-front payments.

The majority of our cash expenditures in 2007, 2006, and 2005
    were to fund research and development, primarily related to our
    clinical programs and, in 2007, our preclinical human monoclonal
    antibody programs. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, we made two
    semi-annual interest payments totaling $11.0 million per
    year on our convertible senior subordinated notes.

Cash
    Provided by Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities was $85.7 million in
    2007 and $155.1 million in 2006, and net cash provided by
    investing activities was $115.5 million in 2005. In 2007
    and 2006, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or
    maturities by $67.3 million and $150.7 million,
    respectively, whereas in 2005, sales or maturities of marketable
    securities exceeded purchases by $120.5 million. In
    addition, capital expenditures in 2007 included the purchase of
    land and a building in Rensselaer, NY for $9.0 million.

Cash
    Provided by Financing Activities:

Cash provided by financing activities was $319.4 million in
    2007, $185.4 million in 2006, and $4.1 million in
    2005. In 2007, sanofi-aventis purchased 12 million newly
    issued, unregistered shares of our Common Stock for gross
    proceeds to us of $312.0 million. In 2006, we completed a
    public offering of 7.6 million shares of our Common Stock
    and received proceeds, after expenses, of $174.6 million.
    In addition, proceeds from issuances of Common Stock in
    connection with exercises of employee stock options were
    $7.6 million in 2007, $10.4 million in 2006, and
    $4.1 million in 2005.

Collaborations
    with the sanofi-aventis Group:

Aflibercept

Under our aflibercept collaboration agreement with
    sanofi-aventis, as described under “Collaborations”
    above, agreed upon worldwide aflibercept development expenses
    incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement,
    including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug
    supply, will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration
    becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse
    sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses, including
    50% of the $25.0 million payment received in connection
    with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement,
    in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
    expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan
    royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. In addition, if
    the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product for
    intraocular delivery to the eye predates the first commercial
    sale of an aflibercept product under the collaboration by two
    years, we will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to
    $7.5 million of aflibercept development expenses in
    accordance with a formula until the first commercial aflibercept
    sale under the collaboration occurs. Since inception of the
    collaboration agreement through December 31, 2007, we and
    sanofi-aventis have incurred $306.8 million in agreed upon
    development expenses related to aflibercept. Currently, multiple
    clinical studies to evaluate aflibercept as both a single agent
    and in combination with other therapies in various cancer
    indications are ongoing, and we and sanofi-aventis plan to
    initiate additional aflibercept clinical studies in 2008.

Sanofi-aventis funded $38.3 million, $36.4 million,
    and $33.9 million, respectively, of our aflibercept
    development costs in 2007, 2006, and 2005, of which
    $10.5 million, $6.8 million, and $10.5 million,
    respectively, were included in accounts receivable as of
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. In addition, we received
    up-front payments of $80.0 million in September 2003 and
    $25.0 million in January 2006 from sanofi-aventis in
    connection with our collaboration. Both up-front payments were
    recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as
    contract research and development revenue over the period during
    which we expect to perform services. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, we
    recognized $8.8 million, $11.4 million, and
    $9.5 million of revenue, respectively, related to these
    up-front payments.


Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of aflibercept
    development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
    rights to aflibercept.

Antibodies

As part of the discovery agreement under our collaboration with
    sanofi-aventis to discover, develop, and commercialize fully
    human monoclonal antibodies, as described under
    “Collaborations” above, sanofi-aventis will fund up to
    $475.0 million of our research through December 31,
    2012, subject to specified funding limits of $75.0 million
    for the period from the collaboration’s inception through
    December 31, 2008, and $100.0 million annually in each
    of the next four years. The discovery agreement will expire on
    December 31, 2012; however, sanofi-aventis has an option to
    extend the agreement for up to an additional three years for
    further antibody development and preclinical activities.

As part of the license agreement under the collaboration, agreed
    upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies
    during the term of the agreement will be funded by
    sanofi-aventis, except that following receipt of the first
    positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug
    candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs (called Shared
    Phase 3 Trial Costs) for that drug candidate will be shared 80%
    by sanofi-aventis and 20% by us. If the collaboration becomes
    profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for
    50% of development expenses that were fully funded by
    sanofi-aventis (or half of $0.7 million as of
    December 31, 2007) and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs,
    in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of
    these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from
    commercialization of collaboration products. The first
    therapeutic antibody to enter clinical development under the
    collaboration is REGN88, which has started clinical trials in
    rheumatoid arthritis. The second is expected to be a Dll4
    antibody, which is currently slated to enter clinical
    development in mid-2008.

In 2007, sanofi-aventis funded $3.0 million of our expenses
    under the collaboration’s discovery agreement and
    $0.7 million of our REGN88 development costs under the
    license agreement. These amounts were included in accounts
    receivable as of December 31, 2007. In addition, the
    $85.0 million up-front payment received from sanofi-aventis
    in December 2007 was recorded to deferred revenue and is being
    recognized as contract research and development revenue over the
    period during which we expect to perform services. In 2007, we
    recognized $0.9 million related to this up-front payment.

With respect to each antibody product which enters development
    under the license agreement, sanofi-aventis or we may, by giving
    twelve months notice, opt-out of further development

and/or

commercialization of the product, in which event the other party
    retains exclusive rights to continue the development

and/or

commercialization of the product. We may also opt-out of the
    further development of an antibody product if we give notice to
    sanofi-aventis within thirty days of the date that
    sanofi-aventis enters joint development of such antibody product
    under the license agreement. Each of the discovery agreement and
    the license agreement contains other termination provisions,
    including for material breach by the other party and, in the
    case of the discovery agreement, a termination right for
    sanofi-aventis under certain circumstances, including if certain
    minimal criteria for the discovery program are not achieved.
    Prior to December 31, 2012, sanofi-aventis has the right to
    terminate the discovery agreement without cause with at least
    three months advance written notice; however, except under
    defined circumstances, sanofi-aventis would be obligated to
    immediately pay to us the full amount of unpaid research funding
    during the remaining term of the research agreement through
    December 31, 2012. Upon termination of the collaboration in
    its entirety, our obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for
    development costs out of any future profits from collaboration
    products will terminate.

Collaboration
    with Bayer HealthCare:

Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare, as
    described under “Collaborations” above, agreed upon
    VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred by both companies in
    2007 under a global development plan, were shared as follows:
    The first $50.0 million was shared equally and we were
    solely responsible for up to the next $40.0 million. In
    2007, cost-sharing between Bayer HealthCare and us of VEGF
    Trap-Eye development expenses resulted in (i) reimbursement
    of $14.3 million of our VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses
    by Bayer HealthCare,


of which $2.8 million was included in accounts receivable
    at December 31, 2007, and (ii) payment of
    $4.9 million of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development
    expenses by us, which was included in accrued expenses at
    December 31, 2007. Neither party was reimbursed for any
    development expenses that it incurred prior to 2007.

In 2008, agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred
    by both companies under a global development plan will be shared
    as follows: Up to the first $70.0 million will be shared
    equally, we are solely responsible for up to the next
    $30.0 million, and over $100.0 million will be shared
    equally. In 2009 and thereafter, all development expenses will
    be shared equally.

If the VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing authorization in a
    major market country outside the United States and the
    collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to
    reimburse Bayer HealthCare out of our share of the collaboration
    profits for 50% of the agreed upon development expenses that
    Bayer HealthCare has incurred (or half of $25.4 million as
    of December 31, 2007) in accordance with a formula based on
    the amount of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has
    incurred and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a
    faster rate at our option. In 2007, we and Bayer HealthCare
    initiated a Phase 3 study of the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. A
    second Phase 3 study of the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD is planned
    for 2008.

We received a $75.0 million up-front payment in October
    2006 and a $20.0 non-substantive milestone payment in August
    2007 from Bayer HealthCare in connection with our collaboration.
    Both payments were recorded to deferred revenue and are being
    recognized as contract research and development revenue over the
    period during which we expect to perform services. In 2007, we
    recognized $15.9 million of revenue related to these
    deferred payments. We did not recognize revenue in connection
    with our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare in 2006.

Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate the agreement
    without cause with at least six months or twelve months advance
    notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of
    termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for
    any reason, we retain all rights to the VEGF Trap-Eye.

National
    Institutes of Health Grant:

Under our five-year grant from the NIH, as described under
    “Other Agreements” above, we are entitled to receive a
    minimum of $17.9 million over a five-year period, subject
    to compliance with the grant’s terms and annual funding
    approvals, and another $1.0 million to optimize our
    existing C57BL/6 ES cell line and its proprietary growth medium.
    In 2007 and 2006, we recognized $5.5 million and
    $0.5 million, respectively, of revenue related to the NIH
    Grant, of which $1.0 million and $0.5 million,
    respectively, was receivable at the end of 2007 and 2006. In
    2008, we expect to receive funding of approximately
    $5 million for reimbursement of Regeneron expenses related
    to the NIH Grant.

License
    Agreement with AstraZeneca and Astellas:

Under these non-exclusive license agreements, AstraZeneca and
    Astellas each made a $20.0 million non-refundable, up-front
    payment to us in February and April 2007, respectively.
    AstraZeneca and Astellas are each required to make up to five
    additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to
    each licensee’s ability to terminate its license agreement
    with us after making the first three additional payments or
    earlier if the technology does not meet minimum performance
    criteria.

Severance
    Costs:

In September 2005, we announced plans to reduce our workforce by
    approximately 165 employees in connection with narrowing
    the focus of our research and development efforts, substantial
    improvements in manufacturing productivity, the September 2005
    expiration of our collaboration with Procter & Gamble,
    and the completion of contract manufacturing for Merck in late
    2006. The majority of the headcount reduction occurred in the
    fourth quarter of 2005. The remaining headcount reductions
    occurred in 2006 as we completed activities related to contract
    manufacturing for Merck.

Costs associated with the workforce reduction were comprised
    principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, and outplacement services. Termination costs
    related to 2005 workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth
    quarter of 2005, and included $0.2 million of non-cash
    expenses. Estimated


termination costs associated with the workforce reduction in
    2006 were measured in October 2005 and expensed ratably over the
    expected service period of the affected employees in accordance
    with SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
    or Disposal Activities

. Total costs associated with the 2005
    and 2006 workforce reductions were $2.6 million, of which
    $2.2 million was charged to expense in the fourth quarter
    of 2005 and $0.4 million was charged to expense in 2006.

Convertible
    Debt:

In 2001, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private
    placement and received proceeds, after deducting the initial
    purchasers’ discount and out-of pocket expenses, of
    $192.7 million. The notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum,
    payable semi-annually, and mature in 2008. The notes are
    convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion
    price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to adjustment
    in certain circumstances. If the price per share of our Common
    Stock is above $30.25 at maturity, we would expect the notes
    would be converted into shares of Common Stock. Otherwise, we
    will be required to repay the $200.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of the notes or refinance the notes prior to
    maturity; however, we can provide no assurance that we will be
    able to successfully arrange such refinancing.

New
    Operating Lease — Tarrytown, New York
    Facilities:

We currently lease approximately 232,000 square feet of
    laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York under
    operating lease agreements. In December 2006, we entered into a
    new operating lease agreement for approximately
    221,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at our
    current Tarrytown location. The new lease includes approximately
    27,000 square feet that we currently occupy (our retained
    facilities) and approximately 194,000 square feet to be
    located in new facilities that are under construction and
    expected to be completed in

mid-2009.

In
    2007, we amended the December 2006 operating lease agreement to
    increase the amount of new space we will lease from
    approximately 194,000 square feet to approximately
    230,000 square feet, for an amended total under the new
    lease of approximately 257,000 square feet. The term of the
    lease is now expected to commence in mid-2008 and will expire
    approximately 16 years later. Under the new lease we also
    have various options and rights on additional space at the
    Tarrytown site, and will continue to lease our present
    facilities until the new facilities are ready for occupancy. In
    addition, the lease contains three renewal options to extend the
    term of the lease by five years each and early termination
    options for our retained facilities only. The lease provides for
    monthly payments over the term of the lease related to our
    retained facilities, the costs of construction and tenant
    improvements for our new facilities, and additional charges for
    utilities, taxes, and operating expenses.

In connection with the new lease agreement, in December 2006, we
    issued a letter of credit in the amount of $1.6 million to
    our landlord, which is collateralized by a $1.6 million
    bank certificate of deposit.

Capital
    Expenditures:

Our additions to property, plant, and equipment totaled
    $19.6 million in 2007, $3.3 million in 2006, and
    $4.7 million in 2005. In 2008, we expect to incur
    approximately $55 to $65 million in capital expenditures
    primarily in connection with expanding our manufacturing
    capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities and tenant
    improvements and related costs in connection with our new
    Tarrytown operating lease, as described above. We expect that
    approximately $30 million of projected 2008 Tarrytown
    tenant improvement costs will be reimbursed by our landlord in
    connection with our new operating lease.

Funding
    Requirements:

Our total expenses for research and development from inception
    through December 31, 2007 have been approximately
    $1,352 million. We have entered into various agreements
    related to our activities to develop and commercialize product
    candidates and utilize our technology platforms, including
    collaboration agreements, such as those with sanofi-aventis and
    Bayer HealthCare, and agreements to use our

Velocigene

technology platform. We incurred expenses associated with these
    agreements, which include an allocable portion of general and
    administrative costs, of $108.2 million,
    $43.4 million, and $42.2 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively.


We expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements
    primarily for research and development activities (including
    preclinical and clinical testing). Before taking into account
    reimbursements from collaborators, we currently anticipate that
    approximately

55-65%

of
    our expenditures for 2008 will be directed toward the
    preclinical and clinical development of product candidates,
    including
    ARCALYST

tm

,
    aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, and monoclonal antibodies (including
    REGN88 and the Dll4 antibody); approximately

15-20%

of
    our expenditures for 2008 will be applied to our basic research
    and early preclinical activities and the remainder of our
    expenditures for 2008 will be used for the continued development
    of our novel technology platforms, capital expenditures, and
    general corporate purposes.

In connection with our funding requirements, the following table
    summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31,
    2007. These obligations and commitments assume non-termination
    of agreements and represent expected payments based on current
    operating forecasts, which are subject to change:

Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, over the next
    several years we and Bayer HealthCare will share agreed upon
    VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred by both companies,
    under a global development plan, as described above. In
    addition, under our collaboration agreements with sanofi-aventis
    and Bayer HealthCare, if the applicable collaboration becomes
    profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to
    reimburse sanofi- aventis and Bayer HealthCare for a defined
    percentage (generally 50%) of

agreed-upon

development expenses incurred by sanofi-aventis and Bayer
    HealthCare, respectively. Profitability under each collaboration
    will be measured by calculating net sales less

agreed-upon

expenses. These reimbursements would be deducted from our share
    of the collaboration profits (and, for our aflibercept
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis, royalties on product sales in
    Japan) otherwise payable to us unless we agree to reimburse
    these expenses at a faster rate at our option. Given the
    uncertainties related to drug development (including the
    development of aflibercept and co-developed antibody candidates
    in collaboration with sanofi-aventis and the VEGF Trap-Eye in
    collaboration with Bayer HealthCare) such as the variability in
    the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate and
    the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for
    commercialization, we are currently unable to reliably estimate
    if our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare
    will become profitable.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend on various
    factors, including the status of competitive products, the
    success of our research and development programs, the potential
    future need to expand our professional and support staff and
    facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual
    property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any
    of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent,
    and success of our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer
    HealthCare. Clinical trial costs are dependent, among other
    things, on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for
    services provided by clinical trial investigators and other
    third


parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for
    use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other
    expenses. The amount of funding that will be required for our
    clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and
    preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory
    requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials
    underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to
    initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each
    trial as described above. In the future, if we are able to
    successfully develop, market, and sell certain of our product
    candidates, we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise
    share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our
    collaboration and licensing agreements.

We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution,
    defense, and enforcement of patent and other intellectual
    property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of
    patent filings and prosecutions in the United States and foreign
    countries.

We believe that our existing capital resources, including
    funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration
    agreements, will enable us to meet operating needs through at
    least 2012. However, this is a forward-looking statement based
    on our current operating plan, and there may be a change in
    projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital
    being consumed significantly before such time. If there is
    insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and
    activities, we believe we would prioritize available capital to
    fund preclinical and clinical development of our product
    candidates. Other than the $1.6 million letter of credit
    issued to our landlord in connection with our new operating
    lease for facilities in Tarrytown, New York, as described above,
    we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we do
    not guarantee the obligations of any other entity. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had no established banking
    arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing
    or a line of credit. In the event we need additional financing
    for the operation of our business, we will consider
    collaborative arrangements and additional public or private
    financing, including additional equity financing. Factors
    influencing the availability of additional financing include our
    progress in product development, investor perception of our
    prospects, and the general condition of the financial markets.
    We may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new
    collaborative arrangements or additional public or private
    offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our
    capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or
    eliminate certain of our research and development activities or
    future operations. This could materially harm our business.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
    Estimates

Revenue
    Recognition:

We recognize contract research and development revenue and
    research progress payments in accordance with Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104) and Emerging Issues Task Force

00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
    Deliverables

(EITF 00-21).

We earn contract research and development revenue and research
    progress payments in connection with collaboration and other
    agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and
    utilize our technology platforms. The terms of these agreements
    typically include non-refundable up-front licensing payments,
    research progress (milestone) payments, and payments for
    development activities. Non-refundable up-front license
    payments, where continuing involvement is required of us, are
    deferred and recognized over the related performance period. We
    estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of
    each agreement, and adjust the performance periods, if
    appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances.
    Payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive
    performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are
    recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the
    related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no
    future service obligation associated with that milestone.
    Substantive performance milestones typically consist of
    significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the
    related product candidate, such as completion of clinical
    trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies, and
    approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a
    payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, we
    take into consideration (i) the nature, timing, and value
    of significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the
    related development product candidate, (ii) the relative
    level of effort required to achieve the milestone, and
    (iii) the relative level of risk in achieving the
    milestone, taking into account the high degree of uncertainty in
    successfully advancing product candidates in a drug development
    program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product.
    Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered
    substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized
    over the related performance period.


We enter into collaboration agreements that include varying
    arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs
    of research and development activities.  We may share the costs
    of research and development activities with our collaborator,
    such as in our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer
    HealthCare, or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant
    portion of the costs of our research and development activities,
    such as in our aflibercept and antibody collaborations with
    sanofi-aventis.  We record our internal and third-party
    development costs associated with these collaborations as
    research and development expenses. When we are entitled to
    reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and
    development expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we
    record those reimbursable amounts as contract research and
    development revenue proportionately as we recognize our
    expenses.  If the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in
    which both we and our collaborator perform development work and
    share costs, in periods when our collaborator incurs development
    expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, we also
    recognize, as additional research and development expense, the
    portion of the collaborator’s development expenses that we
    are obligated to reimburse. In addition, we record revenue in
    connection with a government research grant using a proportional
    performance model as we incur expenses related to the grant,
    subject to the grant’s terms and annual funding approvals.

In connection with non-refundable licensing payments, our
    performance period estimates are principally based on
    projections of the scope, progress, and results of our research
    and development activities. Due to the variability in the scope
    of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug
    product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and
    uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental
    approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period
    estimates are possible, and could result in material changes to
    the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In
    addition, performance periods may be extended if development
    programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to
    expand our clinical plans for a drug candidate into additional
    disease indications. Also, if a collaborator terminates an
    agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement, we
    would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up-front or
    previously deferred payment at the time of the termination. For
    the year ended December 31, 2006, changes in estimates of
    our performance periods, including an extension of our estimated
    performance period for our aflibercept collaboration with
    sanofi-aventis, did not have a material impact on contract
    research and development revenue that we recognized. For the
    year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized
    $2.6 million less in contract research and development
    revenue, compared to amounts recognized in 2006, in connection
    with $105.0 million of non-refundable up-front payments
    previously received from sanofi-aventis pursuant to the
    companies’ aflibercept collaboration, due to an extension
    of our estimated performance period.

Clinical
    Trial Expenses:

Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and
    development expenses and include costs associated with
    third-party contractors. We outsource a substantial portion of
    our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such
    as contract research organizations, independent clinical
    investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist
    us with the execution of our clinical studies. For each clinical
    trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial costs are expensed
    immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the
    expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at
    which patients enter the trial, and the period over which
    clinical investigators or contract research organizations are
    expected to provide services.

Clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites
    and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials
    are performed primarily by contract research organizations
    (CROs). CROs typically perform most of the

start-up

activities for our trials, including document preparation, site
    identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits,
    training, and program management. On a budgeted basis, these

start-up

costs are typically 10% to 15% of the total contract value. On
    an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly
    wider, as many of our contracts with CROs are either expanded or
    reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while

start-up

costs for the particular trial may not change materially. These

start-up

costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has
    been executed and are event driven in nature. The remaining
    activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and
    administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of
    the individual contract or study. In the event of early
    termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize
    expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining
    non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of
    the clinical trial

and/or

penalties.


For clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically
    on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the
    clinical study, we accrue on an estimated

cost-per-patient

basis an expense based on subject enrollment and activity in
    each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in
    a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration
    and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the
    sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment,
    the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of
    the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the
    study. Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in
    estimates are typically those that have a significant number of
    sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient
    screening requirements, and span multiple years. During the
    course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense
    recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. Our
    estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could
    differ significantly from our actual results, which could cause
    material increases or decreases in research and development
    expenses in future periods when the actual results become known.
    No material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual
    estimates were made during the years ended December 31,
    2007 or 2006.

Depreciation
    of Property, Plant, and Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
    is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
    are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
    depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
    removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
    recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

7-30 years

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
    lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of
    construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized
    interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of
    the related asset.

In some situations, the life of the asset may be extended or
    shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe
    that the estimated life of the asset has changed. The life of
    leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of
    lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in the estimated
    lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the
    amount of depreciation recognized in future periods.

Stock-based
    Employee Compensation:

Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value based
    method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under
    the provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, using the modified prospective method as
    described in SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

. As a
    result, in 2005, we recognized compensation expense, in an
    amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments
    (including stock option awards) on their date of grant, over the
    vesting period of the awards using graded vesting, which is an
    accelerated expense recognition method. Under the modified
    prospective method, compensation expense for Regeneron is
    recognized for (a) all share based payments granted on or
    after January 1, 2005 and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date. Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, we
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in APB 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
    interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense related to
    employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses
    in any period prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior
    period operating results have not been restated.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which is a revision
    of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting
    for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
    share-based payment transactions, and requires the recognition
    of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of
    the share-based payment (including stock options and restricted
    stock) issued to employees. SFAS 123R requires companies to
    estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited
    at the


time of grant and to revise this estimate, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Effective January 1, 2005, and prior to our
    adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized the effect of
    forfeitures in stock-based compensation cost in the period when
    they occurred, in accordance with SFAS 123. Upon adoption
    of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, we were
    required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the
    effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards
    that were not expected to vest as of the SFAS 123R adoption
    date. This adjustment reduced our loss by $0.8 million and
    is included in our operating results for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as a cumulative-effect adjustment of a
    change in accounting principle.

We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
    each option granted under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Using this model, fair value is
    calculated based on assumptions with respect to
    (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of our board of directors are expected to hold their options
    prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend
    yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
    rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
    securities with maturities approximating the options’
    expected lives. Expected volatility has been estimated based on
    actual movements in our stock price over the most recent
    historical periods equivalent to the options’ expected
    lives. Expected lives are principally based on our limited
    historical exercise experience with option grants with similar
    exercise prices. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have
    never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any
    in the foreseeable future.

Future
    Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS 157,

Fair Value Measurements

,
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, however on
    December 14, 2007, the FASB issued a proposed staff
    position (FSP

FAS 157-b)

which would delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008. We are required to adopt
    SFAS 157 as it relates to our financial assets and
    financial liabilities effective for the fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2008, and as it relates to our nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities for the fiscal year
    beginning January 1, 2009. Our management does not
    anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a
    material impact on our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159,

The Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

.
    SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The
    objective is to improve financial reporting by providing
    entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported
    earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
    differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting
    provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
    We are required to adopt SFAS 159 effective for the fiscal
    year beginning January 1, 2008. Our management does not
    anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a
    material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Statement

No. 07-3,

Accounting for Non-refundable Advance Payments for Goods or
    Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
    Activities

(EITF 07-3).

EITF 07-3

addresses how entities involved in research and development
    activities should account for the non-refundable portion of an
    advance payment made for future research and development
    activities and requires that such payments be deferred and
    capitalized, and recognized as an expense when the goods are
    delivered or the related services are performed.

EITF 07-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We
    are required to adopt

EITF 07-3

effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008.
    Our management does not anticipate that the adoption of

EITF 07-3

will have a material impact on our financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk:

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to
    changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of
    available cash balances in investment grade corporate,
    asset-backed, and U.S. government securities.


We do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in
    interest rates. Under our current policies we do not use
    interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to
    interest rate changes. We estimated that a one percent change in
    interest rates would result in approximately a $1.9 million
    and $1.7 million decrease in the fair value of our
    investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The increase in the potential impact of an
    interest rate change at December 31, 2007, compared to
    December 31, 2006, is due primarily to slight increases in
    our investment portfolio’s duration to maturity at the end
    of 2007 versus the end of 2006.

Credit
    Quality Risk:

We have an investment policy that includes guidelines on
    acceptable investment securities, minimum credit quality,
    maturity parameters, and concentration and diversification.
    Nonetheless, deterioration of the credit quality of an
    investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the
    risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of
    the security. In 2007, we recognized a $5.9 million charge
    related to marketable securities which we considered to be other
    than temporarily impaired in value.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of our
    chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted
    an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer each concluded that, as of the end of such
    period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
    ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on
    a timely basis, and is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation
    of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting using the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
    evaluation our management has concluded that our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007. The effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007
    has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2007 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.


Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting
    will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
    matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
    reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
    system are met and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the
    inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
    controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
    and instances of fraud or deviations, if any, within the company
    have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated

Framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
    Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements and on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
    our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in note 2 to the financial statements,
    effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method
    of accounting for share-based payment, to conform with FASB
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-based Payment.”

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

1.

Organization
    and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or
    “Regeneron”) was incorporated in January 1988 in the
    State of New York. The Company is engaged in research and
    development programs to discover and commercialize therapeutics
    to treat human disorders and conditions. The Company’s
    facilities are located in New York. The Company’s business
    is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to,
    uncertainties relating to conducting pharmaceutical research,
    obtaining regulatory approvals, commercializing products, and
    obtaining and enforcing patents.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and the balance
    sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
    with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported in the balance
    sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
    is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
    are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
    depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
    removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
    recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

7-30 years

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
    lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of
    construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized
    interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of
    the related asset.

Accounting
    for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of
    long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and
    evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is determined to exist
    if estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the
    carrying amount in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 144,

Accounting
    for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. For all
    periods presented, no impairment losses were recorded.

Patents

As a result of the Company’s research and development
    efforts, the Company has obtained, applied for, or is applying
    for, a number of patents to protect proprietary technology and
    inventions. All costs associated with patents are expensed as
    incurred.

    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

Revenue
    Recognition

a. Contract Research and Development and Research Progress
    Payments

The Company recognizes contract research and development revenue
    and research progress payments in accordance with Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB 104”) and Emerging Issues Task Force

00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
    Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”).

The Company earns contract research and development revenue and
    research progress payments in connection with collaboration and
    other agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates
    and utilize the Company’s technology platforms. The terms
    of these agreements typically include non-refundable up-front
    licensing payments, research progress (milestone) payments, and
    payments for development activities. Non-refundable up-front
    license payments, where continuing involvement is required of
    the Company, are deferred and recognized over the related
    performance period. The Company estimates its performance period
    based on the specific terms of each agreement, and adjusts the
    performance periods, if appropriate, based on the applicable
    facts and circumstances. Payments which are based on achieving a
    specific performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are
    recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the
    related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no
    future service obligation associated with that milestone.
    Substantive performance milestones typically consist of
    significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the
    related product candidate, such as completion of clinical trials
    and approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a
    payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, the
    Company takes into consideration (i) the nature, timing,
    and value of significant achievements in the development
    life-cycle of the related development product candidate,
    (ii) the relative level of effort required to achieve the
    milestone, and (iii) the relative level of risk in
    achieving the milestone, taking into account the high degree of
    uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a
    drug development program and in ultimately attaining an approved
    drug product. Payments for achieving milestones which are not
    considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and
    recognized over the related performance period.

The Company enters into collaboration agreements that include
    varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear
    the costs of research and development activities. The Company
    may share the costs of research and development activities with
    a collaborator, such as in the Company’s VEGF Trap-Eye
    collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC, or the Company may be
    reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of the
    Company’s research and development activities, such as in
    the Company’s aflibercept and antibody collaborations with
    sanofi-aventis. The Company records its internal and third-party
    development costs associated with these collaborations as
    research and development expenses. When the Company is entitled
    to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and
    development expenses that it incurs under a collaboration, the
    Company records those reimbursable amounts as contract research
    and development revenue proportionately as the Company
    recognizes its expenses. If the collaboration is a cost-sharing
    arrangement in which both the Company and its collaborator
    perform development work and share costs, in periods when the
    Company’s collaborator incurs development expenses that
    benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, the Company also
    recognizes, as additional research and development expense, the
    portion of the collaborator’s development expenses that the
    Company is obligated to reimburse. In addition, the Company
    records revenue in connection with a government research grant
    using a proportional performance model as it incurs expenses
    related to the grant, subject to the grant’s terms and
    annual funding approvals.

In connection with non-refundable licensing payments, the
    Company’s performance period estimates are principally
    based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of its
    research and development activities. Due to the variability in
    the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop
    a drug product, changes to development plans as programs
    progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain
    governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to
    performance period estimates are possible, and could result in
    material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year
    in the future. In addition, performance periods may be extended
    if the Company and its collaborators decide to expand the
    clinical plans for a drug candidate into

F-9

    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

additional disease indications. Also, if a collaborator
    terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the
    agreement, the Company would recognize any unamortized remainder
    of an up-front or previously deferred payment at the time of the
    termination.

b. Contract Manufacturing

The Company manufactured product and performed services for a
    third party under a contract manufacturing agreement which
    expired in October 2006. Contract manufacturing revenue was
    recognized as product was shipped and as services were performed
    (see Note 13).

c. Technology Licensing

The Company enters into non-exclusive license agreements with
    third parties that allow the third party to utilize the
    Company’s

VelocImmune

®

technology in its internal research programs. The terms of these
    agreements include annual, non-refundable, up-front payments and
    entitle the Company to receive royalties on any future sales of
    products discovered by the third party using the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology (see Note 12). Annual,
    non-refundable, up-front payments under these agreements, where
    continuing involvement is required of the Company, are deferred
    and recognized ratably over their respective annual license
    periods.

Investment
    Income

Interest income, which is included in investment income, is
    recognized as earned.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs directly
    attributable to the conduct of research and development
    programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
    maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
    collaboration and licensing agreements (see Note 10), the
    cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
    services related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical
    trial expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
    research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, amounts
    that the Company is obligated to reimburse to collaborators for
    research and development expenses that they incur (see
    Note 11), expenses related to the development of
    manufacturing processes prior to commencing commercial
    production of a product under contract manufacturing
    arrangements, and the allocable portions of facility costs, such
    as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance,
    depreciation, and general support services. All costs associated
    with research and development are expensed as incurred.

Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and
    development expenses and include costs associated with
    third-party contractors. The Company outsources a substantial
    portion of its clinical trial activities, utilizing external
    entities such as contract research organizations, independent
    clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers
    to assist the Company with the execution of its clinical
    studies. For each clinical trial that the Company conducts,
    certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while
    others are expensed over time based on the expected total number
    of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the
    trial, and the period over which clinical investigators or
    contract research organizations are expected to provide services.

Clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites
    and other administrative functions to manage the Company’s
    clinical trials are performed primarily by contract research
    organizations (“CROs”). CROs typically perform most of
    the

start-up

activities for the Company’s trials, including document
    preparation, site identification, screening and preparation,
    pre-study visits, training, and program management. On a
    budgeted basis, these

start-up

costs are typically 10% to 15% of the total contract value. On
    an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly
    wider, as many of the Company’s contracts are either
    expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget,
    while

start-up

costs for the particular trial may not change materially. These

start-up

costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has
    been executed and are event driven in nature. The remaining

F-10

REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and
    administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of
    the individual contract or study. In the event of early
    termination of a clinical trial, the Company accrues and
    recognizes expenses in an amount based on its estimate of the
    remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding
    down of the clinical trial

and/or

penalties.

For clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically
    on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the
    clinical study, the Company accrues on an estimated

cost-per-patient

basis an expense based on subject enrollment and activity in
    each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in
    a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration
    and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the
    sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment,
    the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of
    the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the
    study. Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in
    estimates are typically those that have a significant number of
    sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient
    screening requirements, and span multiple years. During the
    course of a trial, the Company adjusts its rate of clinical
    expense recognition if actual results differ from the
    Company’s estimates. The Company’s estimates and
    assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ
    significantly from its actual results, which could cause
    material increases or decreases in research and development
    expenses in future periods when the actual results become known.

Per
    Share Data

Net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is computed on
    the basis of the net income (loss) for the period divided by the
    weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
    Class A Stock outstanding during the period. Basic net
    income (loss) per share excludes restricted stock awards until
    vested. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted
    average number of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock
    outstanding, and of common stock equivalents outstanding when
    dilutive. Common stock equivalents include: (i) outstanding
    stock options and restricted stock awards under the
    Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plans, which are included
    under the treasury stock method when dilutive, and
    (ii) Common Stock to be issued under the assumed conversion
    of the Company’s outstanding convertible senior
    subordinated notes, which are included under the if-converted
    method when dilutive. The computation of diluted net loss per
    share for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005
    does not include common stock equivalents, since such inclusion
    would be antidilutive. Disclosures required by SFAS 128,

Earnings per Share

, have been included in Note 19.

Income
    Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
    method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined on
    the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts
    (“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in
    effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
    reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax
    assets for which realization is uncertain. See Note 17.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

The Company presents comprehensive income (loss) in accordance
    with SFAS 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income.

Comprehensive income (loss) of the Company includes net
    income (loss) adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or
    loss on marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
    comprehensive income (loss) is immaterial. Comprehensive losses
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 have
    been included in the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents,
    marketable securities, and receivables from sanofi-aventis and
    Bayer HealthCare. The Company generally invests its excess cash
    in obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies,
    investment grade debt securities issued by corporations,
    governments, and financial institutions, bank deposits,
    asset-backed securities, commercial paper, and money market
    funds that invest in these instruments. The Company has an
    investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable
    investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity
    parameters, and concentration and diversification. Nonetheless,
    deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security
    subsequent to purchase may subject the Company to the risk of
    not being able to recover the full principal value of the
    security. The Company recognizes a charge to earnings in a
    period when the Company considers a marketable security to be
    other than temporarily impaired in value.

Risks
    and Uncertainties

Regeneron has had no sales of its products and there is no
    assurance that the Company’s research and development
    efforts will be successful, that the Company will ever have
    commercially approved products, or that the Company will achieve
    significant sales of any such products. The Company has
    generally incurred net losses and negative cash flows from
    operations since its inception. Revenues to date have
    principally been limited to (i) payments from the
    Company’s collaborators and other entities for the
    Company’s development activities with respect to product
    candidates and to utilize the Company’s technology
    platforms, (ii) payments for past contract manufacturing
    activities, and (iii) investment income. The Company
    operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and is
    dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants,
    collaborators, and certain third-party suppliers, including
    single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers of certain raw
    materials and equipment. Regeneron, as licensee, licenses
    certain technologies that are important to the Company’s
    business which impose various obligations on the Company. If
    Regeneron fails to comply with these requirements, licensors may
    have the right to terminate the Company’s licenses.

Contract research and development revenue in 2007 was primarily
    earned from sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare under
    collaboration agreements (see Note 11 for the terms of
    these agreements). The Company recognizes revenue from its
    collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare in

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
    include (i) useful lives of property, plant, and equipment,
    (ii) the periods over which certain revenues and expenses
    will be recognized, including contract research and development
    revenue recognized from non-refundable licensing payments and
    expense recognition of certain clinical trial costs which are
    included in research and development expenses, (iii) the
    extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset
    by a valuation allowance, and (iv) the fair value of stock
    options on their date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model, based on assumptions with respect to
    (a) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (b) the periods of time over which employees and members of
    the Company’s board of directors are expected to hold their
    options prior to exercise (expected lives), (c) expected
    dividend yield on the Company’s Common Stock, and
    (d) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted
    U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities
    approximating the options’ expected lives. In addition, in
    connection with the recognition of compensation expense in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R,

Based Payment

, as described below, the Company is
    required to estimate, at the time of grant, the number of stock
    option awards that are expected to be forfeited.

Stock-based
    Employee Compensation

Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair
    value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
    compensation under the provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, using the
    modified prospective method as described in SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure

. As a result, in 2005, the Company
    recognized compensation expense, in an amount equal to the fair
    value of share-based payments (including stock option awards) on
    their date of grant, over the vesting period of the awards using
    graded vesting, which is an accelerated expense recognition
    method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation
    expense for the Company is recognized for (a) all share
    based payments granted on or after January 1, 2005
    (including replacement options granted under the Company’s
    stock option exchange program which concluded on January 5,
    2005 (see Note 14)) and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which
    is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R focuses primarily
    on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains
    employee services in share-based payment transactions, and
    requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount
    equal to the fair value of the share-based payment (including
    stock options and restricted stock) issued to employees.
    SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate, at the time of
    grant, the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited
    and to revise this estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods
    if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Effective
    January 1, 2005 and prior to the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the Company recognized the effect of forfeitures
    in stock-based compensation cost in the period when they
    occurred, in accordance with SFAS 123. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, the Company was
    required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the
    effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards
    that were not expected to vest as of the SFAS 123R adoption
    date. This adjustment reduced the Company’s loss by
    $0.8 million and is included in the Company’s
    operating results in 2006 as a cumulative-effect adjustment of a
    change in accounting principle.

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    $28.0 million, $18.4 million, and $19.9 million,
    respectively, of non-cash stock-based employee compensation
    expense related to stock option awards (“Stock Option
    Expense”) was recognized in operating expenses. In
    addition, for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    $0.1 million of Stock Option Expense was capitalized in
    inventory.

Other disclosures required by SFAS 123 and SFAS 123R
    have been included in Note 14.

Statement
    of Cash Flows

Supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing
    activities:

In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company recognized
    $0.1 million, $0.3 million, and $1.9 million,
    respectively, of compensation expense related to Restricted
    Stock awards, the fair value of which is expensed, on a pro rata
    basis, over the period that the restrictions on the shares lapse
    (see Note 14).

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $1.7 million,
    $0.8 million, and $0.2 million of capital
    expenditures, respectively.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $1.4 million,
    $1.9 million, and $0.6 million, respectively, of
    accrued 401(k) Savings Plan contribution expense. During the
    first quarter of 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company contributed
    64,532, 120,960, and 90,385 shares, respectively, of Common
    Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in satisfaction of these
    obligations.

Future
    Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

, which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
    accounting principles (“GAAP”), and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, however on
    December 14, 2007, the FASB issued a proposed staff
    position (“FSP

FAS 157-b”)

which would delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is required
    to adopt SFAS 157 as it relates to the Company’s
    financial assets and financial liabilities effective for the
    fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008, and as it relates to
    the Company’s nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009.
    Management does not anticipate that the adoption of
    SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159,

The Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

.
    SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The
    objective is to improve financial reporting by providing
    entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported
    earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
    differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting
    provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
    The Company is required to adopt SFAS 159 effective for the
    fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. Management does not
    anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Statement

No. 07-3,

Accounting for Non-refundable Advance Payments for Goods or
    Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
    Activities

(“EITF 07-3”).

EITF 07-3

addresses how entities involved in research and development
    activities should account for the non-refundable portion of an
    advance payment made for future research and development
    activities and requires that such payments be deferred and
    capitalized, and recognized as an expense when the goods are
    delivered or the related services are performed.

EITF 07-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
    Company is required to adopt

EITF 07-3

effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008.
    Management does not anticipate that the adoption of

EITF 07-3

will have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

3.

Severance
    Costs

In September 2005, the Company announced plans to reduce its
    workforce by approximately 165 employees in connection with
    narrowing the focus of the Company’s research and
    development efforts, substantial improvements in manufacturing
    productivity, the June 2005 expiration of the Company’s
    collaboration with The Procter & Gamble Company, and
    the completion of contract manufacturing for Merck &
    Co., Inc. in late 2006. The majority of the headcount reduction
    occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. The remaining headcount
    reductions occurred during 2006 as the Company completed
    activities related to contract manufacturing for Merck.

Costs associated with the workforce reduction were comprised
    principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, and outplacement services. Termination costs
    related to 2005 workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth
    quarter of 2005, and included non-cash expenses due to the
    accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted
    stock held by affected employees. Estimated termination costs
    associated with the planned workforce reduction in 2006 were
    measured in October 2005 and were expensed ratably over the
    expected service period of the affected employees in accordance
    with SFAS 146,

In addition, cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    included an unrealized holding loss of $9 thousand and an
    unrealized holding gain of $12 thousand, respectively.

Realized gains and losses are included as a component of
    investment income. For the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005, gross realized gains and losses on sales of
    marketable securities was not significant. In computing realized
    gains and losses, the Company computes the cost of its
    investments on a specific identification basis. Such cost
    includes the direct costs to acquire the securities, adjusted
    for the amortization of any discount or premium. In 2007,
    deterioration in the credit quality of marketable securities
    from two issuers

    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO

(Unless

    data)

has subjected the Company to the risk of not being able to
    recover the full principal value of these securities, which
    totals $14.0 million. Since market activity for these
    securities is very limited, their fair values at
    December 31, 2007 were developed based on information
    provided by the Company’s investment advisors, including
    but not limited to estimated value of the assets underlying each
    security and quoted bid prices, as applicable. As a result, the
    Company recognized a $5.9 million charge related to these
    marketable securities, which the Company considered to be other
    than temporarily impaired. Excluding these other than
    temporarily impaired securities, fair value of marketable
    securities has been estimated based on inputs that are
    observable for each security, either directly or indirectly,
    through corroboration with observable market data.

The following table shows the unrealized losses and fair value
    of the Company’s marketable securities with unrealized
    losses that are deemed to be only temporarily impaired,
    aggregated by investment category and length of time that
    individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss
    position, at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The securities

At December 31, 2007, the unrealized losses in the
    Company’s marketable securities were primarily caused by
    general instability in the credit markets at the end of 2007. At
    December 31, 2006, the unrealized losses in the
    Company’s marketable securities were primarily caused by
    interest rate increases, which generally resulted in a decrease
    in the market value of the Company’s portfolio. Based upon
    the Company’s currently projected sources and uses of cash,
    the Company intends to hold these securities until a recovery of
    fair value, which may be maturity. Therefore, the Company does
    not consider these marketable securities at December 31,
    2007 and 2006 to be

other

than

temporarily impaired. However, further deterioration in the
    credit markets may subject the Company to the risk of not being
    able to recover the full principal value of certain of its
    marketable securities, which could have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

    time, at the option of the holder into shares of Common Stock on
    a

share-for-share

basis. Holders of Class A Stock have rights and privileges
    identical to Common Stockholders except that Class A
    Stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share, while Common
    Stockholders are entitled to one vote per share. Class A
    Stock may only be transferred to specified Permitted
    Transferees, as defined. Under the Company’s Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation, the Company’s Board of
    Directors (the “Board”) is authorized to issue up to
    30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
    rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined
    by the Board.

In October 2001, the Company completed a private placement of
    $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior
    subordinated notes, which are convertible into shares of the
    Company’s Common Stock. See Note 10.

In November 2006, the Company completed a public offering of
    7.6 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $23.03 per
    share and received proceeds, after expenses, of
    $174.6 million.

In September 2003, sanofi-aventis purchased 2,799,552 newly
    issued, unregistered shares of the Company’s Common Stock
    for $45.0 million. See Note 11.

In December 2007, sanofi-aventis purchased 12 million newly
    issued, unregistered shares of the Company’s Common Stock
    for an aggregate cash price of $312.0 million. As a
    condition to the closing of this transaction, sanofi-aventis
    entered into an investor agreement with the Company. Under the
    investor agreement, sanofi-aventis has three demand rights to
    require the Company to use all reasonable efforts to conduct a
    registered underwritten public offering with respect to shares
    of the Company’s Common Stock beneficially owned by
    sanofi-aventis immediately after the closing of the transaction.
    Until the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or
    earlier termination of the License and Collaboration Agreement
    under the Company’s antibody collaboration with
    sanofi-aventis (see Note 11) and the Company’s
    collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis for the development
    and commercialization of aflibercept (see Note 11),
    sanofi-aventis will be bound by certain “standstill”
    provisions. These provisions include an agreement not to acquire
    more than a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of
    the Company’s Class A Stock and Common Stock. The
    percentage is currently 25% and will increase to 30% after
    December 20, 2011. Sanofi-aventis has also agreed not to
    dispose of any shares of the Company’s Common Stock

that were beneficially owned by sanofi-aventis immediately after
    the closing of the transaction until December 20, 2012,
    subject to certain limited exceptions. Following
    December 20, 2012, sanofi-aventis will be permitted to sell
    shares of the Company’s Common Stock (i) in a
    registered underwritten public offering imdertaken pursuant to
    the demand registration rights granted to sanofi-aventis and
    described above, subject to the underwriter’s broad
    distribution of securities sold, (ii) pursuant to
    Rule 144 under the Securities Act and transactions exempt
    from registration under the Securities Act, subject to a volume
    limitation of one million shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock every three months and a prohibition on selling to
    beneficial owners, or persons that would become beneficial
    owners as a result of such sale, of 5% or more of the
    outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock and

    vote, and cause its affiliates to vote, all shares of the
    Company’s voting securities they are entitled to vote, at
    sanofi-aventis’ election, either as recommended by the
    Company’s Board of Directors or proportionally with the
    votes cast by the Company’s other shareholders, except with
    respect to certain change of control transactions, liquidation
    or dissolution, stock issuances equal to or exceeding 10% of the
    then outstanding shares or voting rights of the Company’s
    Class A Stock and Common Stock, and new equity compensation
    plans or amendments if not materially consistent with the
    Company’s historical equity compensation practices. The
    rights and restrictions under the investor agreement are subject
    to termination upon the occurrence of certain events.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

a.

Operating
    Leases

The Company currently leases laboratory and office facilities in
    Tarrytown, New York under operating lease agreements. In
    December 2006, the Company entered into a new operating lease
    agreement to lease laboratory and office space that is now under
    construction and expected to be completed in mid-2009 at the
    Company’s current Tarrytown location, plus retain a portion
    of the Company’s existing space. In October 2007, the
    Company amended the December 2006 operating lease agreement to
    increase the amount of new space to be leased. The term of the
    lease is expected to commence in mid-2008 and will expire
    approximately 16 years later. Under the new lease the
    Company also has various options and rights on additional space
    at the Tarrytown site, and will continue to lease its present
    facilities until the new facilities are ready for occupancy. In
    addition, the lease contains three renewal options to extend the
    term of the lease by five years each and early termination
    options for the Company’s retained facilities only. The
    lease provides for monthly payments over the term of the lease
    related to the Company’s retained facilities, the costs of
    construction and tenant improvements for the Company’s new
    facilities, and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and
    operating expenses.

In connection with the new lease agreement, in December 2006,
    the Company issued a letter of credit in the amount of
    $1.6 million to its landlord, which is collateralized by a
    $1.6 million bank certificate of deposit. The certificate
    of deposit has been classified as restricted cash at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 in the accompanying financial
    statements.

In November 2007, the Company entered into a new operating
    sublease for additional office space in Tarrytown, New York. The
    lease expires in September 2009 and contains two renewal options
    to extend the term of the sublease by three months each.

The Company formerly leased manufacturing, office, and warehouse
    facilities in Rensselaer, New York under an operating lease
    agreement. The lease provided for base rent plus additional
    rental charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses, as
    defined. In June 2007, the Company exercised a purchase option
    under the lease and, in October 2007, purchased the land and
    building (see Note 6).

The Company leases certain laboratory and office equipment under
    operating leases which expire at various times through 2011.

    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

b.

Convertible
    Debt

In October 2001, the Company issued $200.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated
    notes (“Notes”) in a private placement for proceeds to
    the Company of $192.7 million, after deducting the initial
    purchasers’ discount and out-of-pocket expenses
    (collectively, “Deferred Financing Costs”). The Notes
    bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and
    mature on October 17, 2008. Deferred Financing Costs, which
    are included in other assets, are amortized as interest expense
    over the period from the Notes’ issuance to stated
    maturity. The Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder
    at any time, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a
    conversion price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to
    adjustment in certain circumstances. Regeneron may also redeem
    some or all of the Notes at any time if the closing price of the
    Company’s Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the conversion
    price then in effect for a specified period of time. The fair
    market value of the Notes fluctuates over time. The estimated
    fair value of the Notes at December 31, 2007 was
    approximately $206.1 million.

c.

Research
    Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company’s research and development efforts,
    the Company enters into research collaboration and licensing
    agreements with related and unrelated companies, scientific
    collaborators, universities, and consultants. These agreements
    contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and
    milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be provided,
    and ownership rights to certain proprietary technology developed
    under the agreements. Some of the agreements contain provisions
    which require the Company to pay royalties, as defined, at rates
    that range from 0.25% to 16.5%, in the event the Company sells
    or licenses any proprietary products developed under the
    respective agreements.

Certain agreements under which the Company is required to pay
    fees permit the Company, upon 30 to

90-day

written notice, to terminate such agreements. With respect to
    payments associated with these agreements, the

F-21

    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

Company incurred expenses of $1.0 million,
    $1.1 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

In July 2002, Amgen Inc. and Immunex Corporation (now part of
    Amgen) granted the Company a non-exclusive license to certain
    patents and patent applications which may be used in the
    development and commercialization of
    ARCALYST

TM

(rilonacept;
    also known as IL-1 Trap). The license followed two other
    licensing arrangements under which Regeneron obtained a
    non-exclusive license to patents owned by ZymoGenetics, Inc. and
    Tularik Inc. for use in connection with the
    ARCALYST

TM

program. These license agreements would require the Company to
    pay royalties based on the net sales of
    ARCALYST

TM

if and when it is approved for sale. In total, the royalty rate
    under these three agreements would be in the mid-single digits.

In December 2003, the Company entered into a non-exclusive
    license agreement with Cellectis Inc. that granted the Company
    certain rights in a family of patents relating to homologous
    recombination. Cellectis now claims that agreements the Company
    entered into relating to its

VelocImmune

mice with
    AstraZeneca UK Limited, Astellas Pharma Inc., and sanofi-aventis
    are outside of the scope of the Company’s license from
    Cellectis. The Company disagrees with Cellectis’ position
    and is in discussions with Cellectis regarding this matter. If
    the Company is not able to resolve this dispute, Cellectis may
    commence a lawsuit against the Company and its

VelocImmune

licensees alleging infringement of
    Cellectis’ patents.  The Company is unable to estimate the
    losses or expenses, if any, that may result from the resolution
    of this matter; however, such losses or expenses could be
    material.

11.

Research
    and Development Agreements

The Company has entered into various agreements related to its
    activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and
    utilize its technology platforms. Amounts earned by the Company
    in connection with these agreements, which were recognized as
    contract research and development revenue or other contract
    income, as applicable, totaled $96.6 million,
    $51.1 million, and $83.1 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively. Total Company incurred expenses associated
    with these agreements, which include reimbursable and
    non-reimbursable amounts, an allocable portion of general and
    administrative costs, and cost-sharing of a collaborator’s
    development expenses, where applicable (see Bayer HealthCare
    below), were $108.2 million, $43.4 million and
    $42.2 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
    Significant agreements of this kind are described below.

a.

The
    sanofi-aventis Group

Aflibercept

In September 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement (the “Aventis Agreement”) with Aventis
    Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to sanofi-aventis U.S.), to
    jointly develop and commercialize aflibercept. In connection
    with this agreement, sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable,
    up-front payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552
    newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the
    Aventis Agreement to exclude intraocular delivery of aflibercept
    to the eye (“Intraocular Delivery”) from joint
    development under the agreement, and product rights to
    aflibercept in Intraocular Delivery reverted to Regeneron. In
    connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a
    $25.0 million non-refundable payment to Regeneron (the
    “Intraocular Termination Payment”) in January 2005.

In December 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the
    Aventis Agreement to expand the territory in which the companies
    are collaborating on the development of aflibercept to include
    Japan. In connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis agreed
    to make a $25.0 million non-refundable, up-front payment to
    the Company, which was received in January 2006. Under the
    Aventis Agreement, as amended, the Company and sanofi-aventis
    will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of
    aflibercept outside of Japan, for disease indications

    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

    data)

included in the companies’ collaboration. The Company is
    entitled to a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of
    aflibercept in Japan, subject to certain potential adjustments.
    The Company may also receive up to $400.0 million in
    additional milestone payments upon receipt of specified
    marketing approvals. This total includes up to
    $360.0 million in milestone payments related to the receipt
    of marketing approvals for up to eight aflibercept oncology and
    other indications in the United States or the European Union.
    Another $40.0 million of milestone payments relate to
    receipt of marketing approvals for up to five aflibercept
    oncology indications in Japan.

Under the Aventis Agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide
    development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
    of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the
    collaboration becomes profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses,
    or half of $306.8 million as of December 31, 2007, in
    accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
    expenses and Regeneron’s share of the collaboration profits
    and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at Regeneron’s
    option. Regeneron has the option to conduct additional
    pre-Phase III studies at its own expense. In connection
    with the January 2005 amendment to the Aventis Agreement, the
    Intraocular Termination Payment of $25.0 million will be
    considered an aflibercept development expense and will be
    subject to 50% reimbursement by Regeneron to sanofi-aventis, as
    described above, if the collaboration becomes profitable. In
    addition, if the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product
    in Intraocular Delivery predates the first commercial sale of an
    aflibercept product under the collaboration by two years,
    Regeneron will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to
    $7.5 million of aflibercept development expenses in
    accordance with a formula until the first commercial aflibercept
    sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, Regeneron’s
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis, for 50% of aflibercept
    development expenses will terminate, and the Company will retain
    all rights to aflibercept.

Revenue related to payments from sanofi-aventis under the
    Aventis Agreement, as amended, is being recognized in accordance
    with SAB 104 and

EITF 00-21

(see Note 2). The up-front payments received in September
    2003 and January 2006, of $80.0 million and
    $25.0 million, respectively, and reimbursement of
    Regeneron-incurred development expenses, are being recognized as
    contract research and development revenue over the related
    performance period. The Company recognized $47.1 million,
    $47.8 million, and $43.4 million of contract research
    and development revenue in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively,
    in connection with the Aventis Agreement, as amended. The
    Company also recognized the $25.0 million Intraocular
    Termination Payment as other contract income in 2005. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, amounts receivable from
    sanofi-aventis totaled $10.5 million and $6.9 million,
    respectively, and deferred revenue was $61.2 million and
    $70.0 million, respectively, in connection with the Aventis
    Agreement.

Antibodies

In November 2007, the Company entered into a global, strategic
    collaboration (the “Antibody Collaboration”) with
    sanofi-aventis to discover, develop, and commercialize fully
    human monoclonal antibodies. In connection with the
    collaboration, in December 2007, sanofi-aventis purchased
    12 million newly issued, unregistered shares of the
    Company’s Common Stock for $312.0 million (see
    Note 9).

The Antibody Collaboration is governed by a Discovery and
    Preclinical Development Agreement (the “Discovery
    Agreement”) and a License and Collaboration Agreement (the
    “License Agreement”). The Company received a
    non-refundable, up-front payment of $85.0 million from
    sanofi-aventis under the Discovery Agreement. In addition,
    sanofi-aventis will fund up to $475.0 million of the
    Company’s research for identifying and validating potential
    drug discovery targets and developing fully human monoclonal
    antibodies against such targets through December 31, 2012,
    subject to specified funding limits of $75.0 million for
    the period from the collaboration’s inception through
    December 31, 2008, and $100.0 million annually in each
    of the next four years. The Discovery

    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

Agreement will expire on December 31, 2012; however,
    sanofi-aventis has an option to extend the agreement for up to
    an additional three years for further antibody development and
    preclinical activities.

For each drug candidate identified under the Discovery
    Agreement, sanofi-aventis has the option to license rights to
    the candidate under the License Agreement. If it elects to do
    so, sanofi-aventis will co-develop the drug candidate with the
    Company through product approval. If sanofi-aventis does not
    exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug
    candidate under the License Agreement, the Company will retain
    the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug
    candidate, and sanofi-aventis will receive a royalty on sales,
    if any. Upon inception of the Antibody Collaboration, the
    Company and sanofi-aventis began co-developing the first
    therapeutic antibody, REGN88, under the License Agreement.

Under the License Agreement, agreed upon worldwide development
    expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the
    agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis, except that
    following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results
    for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3
    trial-related costs for that drug candidate (“Shared Phase
    3 Trial Costs”) will be shared 80% by sanofi-aventis and
    20% by Regeneron. If the Antibody Collaboration becomes
    profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to reimburse
    sanofi-aventis for 50% of development expenses that were fully
    funded by sanofi-aventis (or half of $0.7 million as of
    December 31, 2007) and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial
    Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts
    of these expenses and the Company’s share of collaboration
    profits from commercialization of collaboration products.

Sanofi-aventis will lead commercialization activities for
    products developed under the License Agreement, subject to the
    Company’s right to co-promote such products. The parties
    will equally share profits and losses from sales within the
    United States. The parties will share profits outside the United
    States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65%
    (sanofi-aventis)/35% (Regeneron) and ending at 55%
    (sanofi-aventis)/45% (Regeneron), and losses outside the United
    States at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (Regeneron). In addition to
    profit sharing, the Company is entitled to receive up to
    $250.0 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone
    payments commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales
    outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling

12-month

basis.

Regeneron is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
    supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the
    Antibody Collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug
    candidate are being manufactured.

With respect to each antibody product which enters development
    under the License Agreement, sanofi-aventis or the Company may,
    by giving twelve months notice, opt-out of further development

and/or

commercialization of the product, in which event the other party
    retains exclusive rights to continue the development

and/or

commercialization of the product. The Company may also opt-out
    of the further development of an antibody product if it gives
    notice to sanofi-aventis within thirty days of the date that
    sanofi-aventis enters joint development of such antibody product
    under the License Agreement. Each of the Discovery Agreement and
    the License Agreement contains other termination provisions,
    including for material breach by the other party and, in the
    case of the Discovery Agreement, a termination right for
    sanofi-aventis under certain circumstances, including if certain
    minimal criteria for the discovery program are not achieved.
    Prior to December 31, 2012, sanofi-aventis has the right to
    terminate the Discovery Agreement without cause with at least
    three months advance written notice; however, except under
    defined circumstances, sanofi-aventis would be obligated to
    immediately pay to the Company the full amount of unpaid
    research funding during the remaining term of the research
    agreement through December 31, 2012. Upon termination of
    the collaboration in its entirety, the Company’s obligation
    to reimburse sanofi-aventis for development costs out of any
    future profits from collaboration products will terminate. Upon
    expiration of the Discovery Agreement, sanofi-aventis has an
    option to license the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology for agreed upon consideration.

(see Note 2). The $85.0 million up-front payment
    received in December 2007 and reimbursement of
    Regeneron-incurred expenses under the Discovery and License
    Agreements are being recognized as contract research and
    development revenue over the related performance period. In
    connection with the Antibody Collaboration, the Company
    recognized $4.6 million of contract research and
    development revenue in 2007. In addition, at December 31,
    2007, amounts receivable from sanofi-aventis totaled
    $3.7 million and deferred revenue was $84.1 million.

b.

Bayer
    HealthCare LLC

In October 2006, the Company entered into a license and
    collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare LLC to globally
    develop, and commercialize outside the United States, the
    Company’s VEGF Trap for the treatment of eye disease by
    local administration (“VEGF Trap-Eye”). Under the
    terms of the agreement, Bayer HealthCare made a non-refundable,
    up-front payment to the Company of $75.0 million. In
    addition, the Company is eligible to receive up to
    $110.0 million in development and regulatory milestones
    related to the VEGF Trap-Eye program, of which the Company
    received a $20.0 million milestone payment in August 2007
    in connection with the initiation of a Phase 3 trial of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in the neovascular form of age-related macular
    degeneration (“wet AMD”). The Company is also eligible
    to receive up to an additional $135.0 million in sales
    milestones when and if total annual sales of the VEGF Trap-Eye
    outside the United States achieve certain specified levels
    starting at $200.0 million.

The Company will share equally with Bayer HealthCare in any
    future profits arising from the commercialization of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye outside the United States. If the VEGF Trap-Eye is
    granted marketing authorization in a major market country
    outside the United States and the collaboration becomes
    profitable, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Bayer
    HealthCare out of its share of the collaboration profits for 50%
    of the agreed upon development expenses that Bayer HealthCare
    has incurred (or half of $25.4 million as of
    December 31, 2007) in accordance with a formula based
    on the amount of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has
    incurred and the Company’s share of the collaboration
    profits, or at a faster rate at the Company’s option.
    Within the United States, the Company is responsible for any
    future commercialization of the VEGF Trap-Eye and retains
    exclusive rights to any future profits from commercialization.

Agreed upon development expenses incurred by both companies in
    2007 under a global development plan were shared as follows: The
    first $50.0 million were shared equally and the Company was
    solely responsible for up to the next $40.0 million.
    Neither party was reimbursed for any development expenses that
    it incurred prior to 2007.

In 2008, agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred
    by both companies under a global development plan will be shared
    as follows: Up to the first $70.0 million will be shared
    equally, the Company is solely responsible for up to the next
    $30.0 million; and over $100.0 million will be shared
    equally. In 2009 and thereafter, all development expenses will
    be shared equally. Regeneron is also obligated to use
    commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical and
    commercial product requirements.

Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate the Bayer Agreement
    without cause with at least six months or twelve months advance
    notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of
    termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for
    any reason, the Company retains all rights to the VEGF Trap-Eye.

For the period from the collaboration’s inception in
    October 2006 through September 30, 2007, all up-front
    licensing, milestone, and cost-sharing payments received or
    receivable from Bayer HealthCare had been fully deferred and
    included in deferred revenue for financial statement purposes.
    In the fourth quarter of 2007, Regeneron and Bayer HealthCare
    approved a global development plan for the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet
    AMD. The plan includes estimated development steps, timelines,
    and costs, as well as the projected responsibilities of and
    costs to be incurred by each of the companies. In addition, in
    the fourth quarter of 2007, Regeneron and Bayer

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

HealthCare reaffirmed the companies’ commitment to a DME
    development program and had initial estimates of development
    costs for the VEGF Trap-Eye in DME. As a result, effective in
    the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company determined the
    appropriate accounting policy for payments from Bayer HealthCare
    and

cost-sharing

of the Company’s and Bayer HealthCare’s VEGF Trap-Eye
    development expenses, and the financial statement
    classifications and periods in which past and future payments
    from Bayer HealthCare (including the $75.0 million up-front
    payment and development and regulatory milestone payments) and
    cost-sharing of VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses will be
    recognized in the Company’s Statement of Operations.

The $75.0 million up-front licensing payment and
    $20.0 million milestone payment (which was not considered
    substantive) from Bayer HealthCare are being recognized as
    contract research and development revenue over the related
    estimated performance period in accordance with SAB 104 and

EITF 00-21

(see Note 2). In periods when the Company recognizes VEGF
    Trap-Eye development expenses that the Company incurs under the
    collaboration, the Company also recognizes, as contract research
    and development revenue, the portion of those VEGF Trap-Eye
    development expenses that is reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare.
    In periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs agreed upon VEGF
    Trap-Eye development expenses that benefit the collaboration and
    Regeneron, the Company also recognizes, as additional research
    and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare’s
    VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that the Company is obligated
    to reimburse. In the fourth quarter of 2007, when the Company
    commenced recognizing previously deferred payments from Bayer
    HealthCare and cost-sharing of the Company’s and Bayer
    HealthCare’s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, the
    Company recognized, as a cumulative

catch-up,

contract research and development revenue of $35.9 million,
    consisting of (i) $15.9 million related to the
    $75.0 million up-front licensing payment and the
    $20.0 million milestone payment, and
    (ii) $20.0 million related to the portion of the
    Company’s 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that is
    reimbursable from Bayer HealthCare. In addition, in the fourth
    quarter of 2007, the Company recognized as additional research
    and development expense a cumulative

catch-up

of
    $10.6 million of 2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses
    that the Company was obligated to reimburse to Bayer HealthCare.

At December 31, 2007, in connection with cost-sharing of
    VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses under the collaboration,
    $4.9 million was payable to Bayer HealthCare and
    $2.8 million was receivable from Bayer HealthCare. In
    addition, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, deferred revenue
    from the Company’s collaboration with Bayer HealthCare was
    $79.1 million and $75.0 million, respectively.

c.

The
    Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, the Company entered into a long-term collaboration
    with The Procter & Gamble Company to discover,
    develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products, and
    Procter & Gamble agreed to provide funding for
    Regeneron’s research efforts related to the collaboration.
    In accordance with the companies’ collaboration agreement
    (the “P&G Agreement”), Procter & Gamble
    was obligated to fund Regeneron research on therapeutic
    areas that were of particular interest to Procter &
    Gamble through December 2005, with no further research
    obligations by either party thereafter. Under the P&G
    Agreement, research support from Procter & Gamble was
    $2.5 million per quarter, plus adjustments for inflation,
    through December 2005.

In June 2005, the Company and Procter & Gamble amended
    the P&G Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the modified
    agreement, the Company and Procter & Gamble agreed
    that the research activities of the parties under the P&G
    Agreement were completed on June 30, 2005, six months prior
    to the December 31, 2005 expiration date in the P&G
    Agreement. In connection with the amendment, Procter &
    Gamble made a one-time $5.6 million payment to Regeneron
    and the Company paid approximately $1.0 million to
    Procter & Gamble to acquire certain capital equipment
    owned by Procter & Gamble and located at the
    Company’s facilities. Procter & Gamble and the
    Company divided rights to research programs and pre-clinical
    product candidates that were developed during the research term
    of the P&G Agreement. Neither party has the right to
    participate in the development or commercialization of the other
    party’s product candidates. The Company is entitled to
    receive royalties based on any future

product sales of a Procter & Gamble pre-clinical
    candidate arising from the collaboration, and
    Procter & Gamble is entitled to receive a small
    royalty on any sales of a single Regeneron candidate that is
    currently not being developed. Neither party is entitled to
    receive royalties or other payments based on any other products
    arising from the collaboration.

Contract research and development revenue related to the
    Company’s collaboration with Procter & Gamble was
    $6.0 million in 2005. In addition, the one-time
    $5.6 million payment made by Procter & Gamble to
    the Company in connection with the amendment to the P&G
    Agreement was recognized as other contract income in 2005.

d.

Serono,
    S.A. (now part of Merck KGaA)

In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement (the
    “Serono Agreement”) with Serono S.A. to use
    Regeneron’s proprietary

VelociGene

®

technology platform to provide Serono with knock-out and
    transgenic mammalian models of gene function
    (“Materials”). The Serono Agreement contains
    provisions for minimum yearly order quantities. In connection
    with its orders for Materials, Serono makes advance payments to
    Regeneron, which are accounted for as deferred revenue.
    Regeneron recognizes revenue and reduces the deferred revenue
    balance as Materials are shipped to and accepted by Serono. In
    2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company recognized $2.4 million,
    $1.8 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, of
    contract research and development revenue in connection with the
    Serono Agreement.

e.

National
    Institutes of Health

In September 2006, the Company was awarded a grant from the
    National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) as part of the
    NIH’s Knockout Mouse Project. The NIH grant provides a
    minimum of $17.9 million in funding over a five-year
    period, subject to compliance with its terms and annual funding
    approvals, for the Company’s use of its

VelociGene

technology to generate a collection of targeting vectors and
    targeted mouse embryonic stem cells which can be used to produce
    knockout mice. The Company will also receive another
    $1.0 million in funding to optimize certain existing
    technology for use in the Knockout Mouse Project. In 2007 and
    2006, the Company recognized contract research and development
    revenue of $5.5 million and $0.5 million,
    respectively, from the NIH Grant.

12.

Technology
    Licensing Agreements

In February 2007, the Company entered into a non-exclusive
    license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited that allows
    AstraZeneca to utilize the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology in its internal research programs to discover
    human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement,
    AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million

non-refundable,

up-front payment to the Company which was deferred and is being
    recognized as revenue ratably over the twelve month period
    beginning in February 2007. AstraZeneca is required to make up
    to five additional annual payments of $20.0 million,
    subject to its ability to terminate the agreement after making
    the first three additional payments or earlier if the technology
    does not meet minimum performance criteria. These additional
    payments will be recognized as revenue ratably over their
    respective annual license periods. The Company is entitled to
    receive a mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of
    antibody products discovered by AstraZeneca using the
    Company’s

VelocImmune

technology. In connection with
    the AstraZeneca license agreement, for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Company recognized
    $17.1 million of revenue and, at December 31, 2007,
    deferred revenue was $2.9 million.

In March 2007, the Company entered into a non-exclusive license
    agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc. that allows Astellas to
    utilize the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology in its
    internal research programs to discover human monoclonal
    antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement, Astellas made a
    $20.0 million non-refundable,

up-front

payment to the Company, which was deferred and is being
    recognized as revenue ratably over the twelve month period
    beginning in June 2007. Astellas is required to make up to five
    additional annual payments of

$20.0 million, subject to its ability to terminate the
    agreement after making the first three additional payments or
    earlier if the technology does not meet minimum performance
    criteria. These additional payments will be recognized as
    revenue ratably over their respective annual license periods.
    The Company is entitled to receive a mid-single-digit royalty on
    any future sales of antibody products discovered by Astellas
    using the Company’s

VelocImmune

technology. In
    connection with the Astellas license agreement, for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized
    $11.3 million of revenue and, at December 31, 2007,
    deferred revenue was $8.7 million.

13.

Manufacturing
    Agreement

During 1995, the Company entered into a long-term manufacturing
    agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., as amended, (the
    “Merck Agreement”) to produce an intermediate (the
    “Intermediate”) for a Merck pediatric vaccine at the
    Company’s Rensselaer, New York facility. The Company
    modified portions of its facility for manufacture of the
    Intermediate and assisted Merck in securing regulatory approval
    for such manufacture in the Company’s facility. The Merck
    Agreement called for the Company to manufacture Intermediate for
    Merck for a specified period of time (the “Production
    Period”), with certain minimum order quantities each year.
    The Production Period commenced in November of 1999 and
    originally extended for six years. In February 2005, the Company
    and Merck amended the Merck Agreement to extend the Production
    Period through October 2006, at which time the Merck Agreement
    terminated.

Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the capital costs to
    modify the facility (“Capital Costs”). Merck also
    agreed to pay an annual facility fee (the “Facility
    Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning March 1995, subject to
    annual adjustment for inflation. During the Production Period,
    Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for certain manufacturing
    costs, pay the Company a variable fee based on the quantity of
    Intermediate supplied to Merck, and make additional bi-annual
    payments (“Additional Payments”), as defined. In
    addition, Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the cost of
    Company activities performed on behalf of Merck prior to the
    Production Period and for miscellaneous costs during the
    Production Period (“Internal Costs”). These payments
    were recognized as contract manufacturing revenue as follows:
    (i) payments for Internal Costs were recognized as the
    activities were performed, (ii) the Facility Fee and
    Additional Payments were recognized over the period to which
    they related, (iii) payments for Capital Costs were
    deferred and recognized as Intermediate was shipped to Merck,
    and (iv) payments related to the manufacture of
    Intermediate during the Production Period (“Manufacturing
    Payments”) were recognized after the Intermediate was
    tested and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to,
    Merck.

In 2006 and 2005, Merck contract manufacturing revenue totaled
    $12.3 million and $13.7 million, respectively. Such
    amounts include $1.2 million and $1.4 million of
    previously deferred Capital Costs, respectively.

14.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plans

During 2000, the Company established the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2000
    Incentive Plan”) which, as amended, provides for the
    issuance of up to 18,500,000 shares of Common Stock in
    respect of awards. In addition, shares of Common Stock
    previously approved by shareholders for issuance under the
    Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan
    (“1990 Incentive Plan”) that are not issued under the
    1990 Incentive Plan, may be issued as awards under the 2000
    Incentive Plan. Employees of the Company, including officers,
    and nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members
    of the Company’s board of directors, (collectively,
    “Participants”) may receive awards as determined by a
    committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The
    awards that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include:
    (a) Incentive Stock Options (“ISOs”) and
    Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
    (c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and
    (e) Other Awards.

    data)

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right to purchase
    shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the Committee;
    however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise price will
    not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common
    Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest over a
    period of time determined by the Committee, generally on a pro
    rata basis over a three to five year period. The Committee also
    determines the expiration date of each Option; however, no ISO
    is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant. The
    maximum term of options that have been awarded under the 2000
    Incentive Plan is ten years.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares of restricted
    Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase such shares at a
    price determined by the Committee. Such shares are
    nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee
    (“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as
    defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the
    Restricted Stock, which has not vested, will be transferred to
    the Company, except under defined circumstances with Committee
    approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the
    Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company
    requires a return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the
    right to require a return of all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the right to
    receive, within 30 days of the date on which the share
    vests, an amount, in cash

and/or

shares of the Company’s Common Stock as determined by the
    Committee, equal to the sum of the fair market value of a share
    of Common Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests
    and the aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to
    a share of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of
    the share of Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests.
    Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock
    which are granted at the discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are valued based on
    the Company’s Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of
    the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions of such Other
    Awards are determined solely on the authority of the Committee.

During 1990, the Company established the 1990 Incentive Plan
    which, as amended, provided for a maximum of
    6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of awards.
    Employees of the Company, including officers, and nonemployees,
    including consultants and nonemployee members of the
    Company’s board of directors, received awards as determined
    by a committee of independent directors. Under the provisions of
    the 1990 Incentive Plan, there will be no future awards from the
    plan. Awards under the 1990 Incentive Plan consisted of
    Incentive Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock Options which
    generally vested on a pro rata basis over a three or five year
    period and have a term of ten years.

The 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans contain provisions that allow
    for the Committee to provide for the immediate vesting of awards
    upon a change in control of the Company, as defined.

As of December 31, 2007, there were 744,879 shares
    available for future grants under the 2000 Incentive Plan.

Non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense recognized in
    operating expenses is provided in Note 2. As of
    December 31, 2007, there was $60.6 million of
    stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding nonvested
    stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, which had not yet
    been recognized in operating expenses. The Company expects to
    recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period
    of 1.8 years. In addition, there are 723,092 options which
    are unvested as of December 31, 2007 and would become
    vested upon the attainment of certain performance and service
    conditions. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant
    date, related to these performance options totals
    $2.7 million and will begin to be recognized only if, and
    when, these options’ performance condition is considered to
    be probable of attainment.

Fair
    value Assumptions:

The fair value of each option granted under the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Incentive Plan during 2007, 2006, and
    2005 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. Using this model, fair value is calculated
    based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected
    volatility of the Company’s Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of the Company’s board of directors are expected to hold
    their options prior to exercise (expected lives),
    (iii) expected dividend yield on the Company’s Common
    Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based
    on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with
    maturities approximating the options’ expected lives.
    Expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements
    in the Company’s stock price over the most recent
    historical periods equivalent to the options’ expected
    lives. Expected lives are principally based on the
    Company’s limited historical exercise experience with
    option grants with similar exercise prices. The expected
    dividend yield is zero as the Company has never paid dividends
    and does not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable
    future. The following table summarizes

    Stock Option Exchange:

In December 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved a
    stock option exchange program. Under the program, Company
    regular employees who work an average of 20 hours per week,
    other than the Company’s chairman and the Company’s
    president and chief executive officer, were provided the
    opportunity to make a one-time election to surrender options
    granted under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans that had an
    exercise price of at least $18.00 and exchange them for
    replacement options granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan in
    accordance with the following exchange ratios:

Exchange Ratio

(Number of Eligible

Surrendered and

$18.00 to $28.00

1.50

$28.01 to $37.00

2.00

$37.01 and up

3.00

Participation in the stock option exchange program was
    voluntary, and non-employee directors, consultants, former
    employees, and retirees were not eligible to participate. The
    participation deadline was January 5, 2005 and 329 eligible
    employees participated in the program. These employees elected
    to exchange options with a total of 3,665,819 underlying shares
    of Common Stock, and the Company issued 1,977,840 replacement
    options with an exercise price of $8.50 per share on
    January 5, 2005.

Each replacement option was completely unvested upon grant. Each
    replacement option granted to an employee other than our
    executive vice president and senior vice presidents will
    ordinarily become vested and exercisable with respect to
    one-fourth of the shares initially underlying such option on
    each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the
    grant date so that such replacement option will be fully vested
    and exercisable four years after it was granted. Each
    replacement option granted to the Company’s executive vice
    president and senior vice presidents will ordinarily vest with
    respect to all shares underlying such option if both
    (i) the Company’s products have achieved gross sales
    of at least $100 million during any consecutive twelve
    month period (either directly by the Company or through its
    licenses) and (ii) the specific executive or senior vice
    president has remained employed by the Company for at least
    three years from the date of grant. For all replacement options,
    the recipient’s vesting and exercise rights are contingent
    upon the recipients continued employment through the applicable
    vesting date and subject to the other terms of the 2000
    Incentive Plan and the applicable option award agreement. As is
    generally the case with respect to the option award agreements
    for options that were eligible for exchange pursuant to the
    stock option exchange program, the option award agreements for
    replacement options include provisions whereby the replacement
    options may be fully vested in connection with a “Change in
    Control” of the Company, as defined in the 2000 Incentive
    Plan.

Under the stock option exchange program, each replacement option
    has a term equal to the greater of (i) the remaining term
    of the surrendered option it replaces and (ii) six years
    from the date of grant of the replacement

option. This was intended to ensure that the employees who
    participated in the stock option exchange program would not
    derive any additional benefit from an extended option term
    unless the surrendered option had a remaining term of less than
    six years. In connection with the replacement options issued
    under the stock option exchange program, the Company will
    recognize total incremental compensation cost of
    $2.0 million over the vesting periods of these options.

In December 2007, the Company awarded a grant of Restricted
    Stock to the Company’s executive vice president. In
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the
    Company records unearned compensation in Stockholders’
    Equity related to grants of Restricted Stock awards. This amount
    is based on the fair market value of shares of the
    Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and is
    expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the period that the
    restriction on these shares lapse, which is five years for the
    grant made in 2007, approximately two years for grants made in
    2003, and 18 months for grants made in 2004. In addition,
    unearned compensation in Stockholders’ Equity is reduced
    due to forfeitures of Restricted Stock resulting from employee
    terminations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, unearned
    compensation was included as a separate component of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Effective January 1, 2006,
    unearned compensation is combined with additional paid-in
    capital in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R.

In connection with the 2007 grant of Restricted Stock, the
    Company recorded unearned compensation in Stockholder’s
    Equity of $11.0 million, which was combined with additional
    paid-in capital. In connection with forfeitures of past
    Restricted Stock awards, the Company reduced unearned
    compensation by $17 thousand and $0.1 million in 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The Company recognized non-cash compensation
    expense from Restricted Stock awards of $0.1 million,
    $0.3 million, and $1.9 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there were
    500,000 unvested shares of Restricted Stock outstanding and
    $10.9 million of stock-based compensation cost related to
    these unvested shares which had not yet been recognized in
    operating expenses.

15.

Executive
    Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock Purchase Plan
    (the “Plan”) under which 1,027,500 shares of
    Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock awards.
    The Plan provides for the compensation committee of the board of
    directors to award employees, directors, consultants, and other
    individuals (“Plan participants”) who render service
    to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock at a
    price set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides for
    the vesting of shares as determined by the compensation
    committee and, should the

Company’s relationship with a Plan participant terminate
    before all shares are vested, unvested shares will be
    repurchased by the Company at a price per share equal to the
    original amount paid by the Plan participant. During 1989 and
    1990, a total of 983,254 shares were issued, all of which
    vested as of December 31, 1999. As of December 31,
    2007, there were 44,246 shares available for future grants
    under the Plan.

16.

Employee
    Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Savings
    Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide for employees
    who have met defined service requirements to participate in the
    Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the Savings Plan a
    percentage of their compensation to be set aside to pay their
    future retirement benefits, as defined. The Savings Plan, as
    amended and restated, provides for the Company to make
    discretionary contributions (“Contribution”), as
    defined. The Company recorded Contribution expense of
    $1.4 million in 2007, $1.3 million in 2006, and
    $2.0 million in 2005; such amounts were accrued as
    liabilities at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively. During the first quarter of 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    the Company contributed 58,575, 64,532, and 120,960 shares,
    respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings Plan in
    satisfaction of these obligations.

17.

Income
    Taxes

In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company incurred net losses for tax
    purposes and recognized a full tax valuation against deferred
    taxes. Accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes has
    been recorded in the accompanying financial statements.

The tax effect of temporary differences, net operating loss
    carry-forwards, and research and experimental tax credit
    carry-forwards as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as
    follows:

The Company’s valuation allowance increased by
    $30.7 million in 2007, due primarily to the temporary
    difference related to deferred revenue, principally resulting
    from the non-refundable up-front payment received from
    sanofi-aventis in December 2007 (see Note 11). In 2006, the
    Company’s valuation allowance increased by
    $41.6 million, due primarily to increases in the
    Company’s net operating loss carry-forward and the
    temporary difference related to deferred revenue, principally
    resulting from the non-refundable up-front payment received from
    Bayer HealthCare in 2006 (see Note 11).

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”),

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

The implementation of FIN 48 had no impact on the
    Company’s financial statements as the Company has not
    recognized any uncertain income tax positions.

F-34

REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

The Company is primarily subject to U.S. federal and New
    York State income tax. For all years presented, the
    Company’s effective income tax rate is zero. The difference
    between the Company’s effective income tax rate and the
    Federal statutory rate of 35% is attributable to state tax
    benefits and tax credit carry-forwards offset by an increase in
    the deferred tax valuation allowance. The Company’s 1992
    and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by
    U.S. federal and state tax authorities.

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties
    related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of
    January 1 and December 31, 2007, the Company had no
    accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had available for tax
    purposes unused net operating loss carry-forwards of
    $423.2 million which will expire in various years from 2008
    to 2027 and included $12.7 million of net operating loss
    carry-forwards related to exercises of Nonqualified Stock
    Options and disqualifying dispositions of Incentive Stock
    Options, the tax benefit from which, if realized, will be
    credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company’s
    research and experimental tax credit carry-forwards expire in
    various years from 2008 to 2027. Under the Internal Revenue Code
    and similar state provisions, substantial changes in the
    Company’s ownership have resulted in an annual limitation
    on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit
    carry-forwards that can be utilized in future years to offset
    future taxable income. This annual limitation may result in the
    expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards
    before utilization.

18.

Legal
    Matters

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings
    in the course of the Company’s business. The Company does
    not expect any such current legal proceedings to have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business or financial
    condition. Costs associated with the Company’s resolution
    of legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.

19.

Net Loss
    Per Share Data

The Company’s basic net loss per share amounts have been
    computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of
    Common and Class A shares outstanding. Net loss per share
    is presented on a combined basis, inclusive of Common Stock and
    Class A Stock outstanding, as each class of stock has
    equivalent economic rights. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company
    reported net losses; therefore, no common stock equivalents were
    included in the computation of diluted net loss per share since
    such inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of
    basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:

Segment
    Information

Through 2006, the Company’s operations were managed in two
    business segments: research and development, and contract
    manufacturing.

Research and development:

Includes all
    activities related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products
    for the treatment of serious medical conditions, and the
    development and commercialization of these discoveries. This
    segment includes revenues and expenses related to activities
    conducted under research and development agreements (see
    Note 11) and technology licensing agreements (see
    Note 12).

Contract manufacturing:

Includes all revenues
    and expenses related to the commercial production of products
    under contract manufacturing arrangements. During 2006 and 2005,
    the Company produced a vaccine intermediate for
    Merck & Co., Inc. under a manufacturing agreement,
    which expired in October 2006 (see Note 13).

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those
    described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
    Due to the expiration of the Company’s manufacturing
    agreement with Merck in October 2006, beginning in 2007, the
    Company only has a research and development business segment.
    Therefore, segment information has not been provided for 2007 in
    the table below.

As described in Note 11, effective in the fourth quarter of
    2007, the Company determined the appropriate accounting policy
    for payments from Bayer HealthCare. As a result, in the fourth
    quarter of 2007, when the Company commenced recognizing
    previously deferred payments from Bayer HealthCare and
    cost-sharing of the Company’s and Bayer HealthCare’s
    2007 VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, the Company recognized
    contract research and development revenue from Bayer HealthCare
    of $35.9 million and additional research and development
    expense of $10.6 million.
