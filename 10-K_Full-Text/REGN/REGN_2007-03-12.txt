contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
    uncertainties relating to future events and the future financial
    performance of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and actual
    events or results may differ materially. These statements
    concern, among other things, the possible success and
    therapeutic applications of our product candidates and research
    programs, the timing and nature of the clinical and research
    programs now underway or planned, and the future sources and
    uses of capital and our financial needs. These statements are
    made by us based on management’s current beliefs and
    judgment. In evaluating such statements, stockholders and
    potential investors should specifically consider the various
    factors identified under the caption “Risk Factors”
    which could cause actual events or results to differ materially
    from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. We do
    not undertake any obligation to update publicly any
    forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
    information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by
    law.

General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company
    that discovers, develops, and intends to commercialize
    pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical
    conditions. We are currently focused on three development
    programs: IL-1 Trap (rilonacept) in various inflammatory
    indications, the VEGF Trap in oncology, and the VEGF Trap eye
    formulation (VEGF Trap-Eye) in eye diseases using intraocular
    delivery. The VEGF Trap is being developed in oncology in
    collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group. In October 2006, we
    entered into collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC for the
    development of the VEGF-Trap-Eye. Our preclinical research
    programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis,
    ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases
    and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and
    cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases. We expect that our
    next generation of product candidates will be based on our
    proprietary technologies for discovering and producing human
    monoclonal antibodies. Developing and commercializing new
    medicines entails significant risk and expense. Since inception
    we have not generated any sales or profits from the
    commercialization of any of our product candidates.

Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in
    basic scientific research and discovery-enabling technology and
    combine that foundation with our manufacturing and clinical
    development capabilities to build a successful, integrated
    biopharmaceutical company. We believe that our ability to
    develop product candidates is enhanced by the application of our
    technology platforms. Our discovery platforms are designed to
    identify specific genes of therapeutic interest for a particular
    disease or cell type and validate targets through
    high-throughput production of mammalian models. Our human
    monoclonal antibody
    (VelocImmune

®

)
    and cell line expression technologies may then be utilized to
    design and produce new product candidates directed against the
    disease target. Based on the VelocImmune platform which we
    believe, in conjunction with our other proprietary technologies,
    can accelerate the development of fully human monoclonal
    antibodies, we plan to move two new antibody candidates into
    clinical trials each year going forward beginning around the end
    of 2007. We continue to invest in the development of enabling
    technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, and
    commercialize new product candidates.

Clinical
    Programs:

1.

IL-1
    Trap — Inflammatory Diseases

The IL-1 Trap (rilonacept) is a protein-based product candidate
    designed to bind the interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine and
    prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors. We are
    evaluating the IL-1 Trap in a number of diseases and disorders
    in which IL-1 may play an important role, including a spectrum
    of rare diseases called Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes
    (CAPS) and other diseases associated with inflammation.

In October 2006, we announced positive data from a Phase 3
    clinical program designed to provide two separate demonstrations
    of efficacy for the IL-1 Trap within a single group of adult
    patients suffering from CAPS. The Phase 3 program of the
    IL-1 Trap included two studies (Part A and Part B).
    Both studies met their primary endpoints (Part A: p <
    0.0001 and Part B: p < 0.001). The primary endpoint of
    both studies was the change in disease activity,



which was measured using a composite symptom score composed of a
    daily evaluation of fever/chills, rash, fatigue, joint pain, and
    eye redness/pain.

We plan to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second
    quarter of 2007, following completion of a

24-week

open-label extension phase. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug
    status and Fast Track designation to the IL-1 Trap for the
    treatment of CAPS.

The first study (Part A) was a double-blind and
    placebo-controlled

6-week

trial, in which patients randomized to receive the IL-1 Trap had
    an approximate 85% reduction in their mean symptom score
    compared to an approximate 13% reduction in patients treated
    with placebo (p<0.0001). Following a

9-week

interval during which all patients received the IL-1 Trap, a
    “randomized withdrawal” study (Part B) was
    performed, in which the same patients were re-randomized to
    either switch to placebo or continue treatment with the IL-1
    Trap in a double-blind manner. During the

9-week

randomized withdrawal period, patients who were switched to
    placebo had a five-fold increase in their mean symptom score,
    compared with those remaining on the IL-1 Trap who had no
    significant change (p=.0002). Both the Part A and
    Part B studies achieved statistical significance in all of
    their pre-specified secondary and exploratory endpoints.

Preliminary analysis of the safety data from both studies
    indicated that there were no drug-related serious adverse
    events. Injection site reactions and upper respiratory tract
    infections, all mild to moderate in nature, occurred more
    frequently in patients while on the IL-1 Trap than on placebo.
    In these two studies, the IL-1 Trap appeared to be well
    tolerated; 46 of 47 randomized patients completed the
    Part A study, and 44 of 45 randomized patients completed
    the Part B study. The

24-week

open-label extension phase is ongoing.

CAPS is a spectrum of rare inherited inflammatory conditions,
    including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS),
    Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), and Neonatal Onset Multisystem
    Inflammatory Disease (NOMID). These syndromes are characterized
    by spontaneous systemic inflammation and are termed
    autoinflammatory disorders. A novel feature of these conditions
    (particularly FCAS and MWS) is that exposure to mild degrees of
    cold temperature can provoke a major inflammatory episode that
    occurs within hours. CAPS are caused by a range of mutations in
    the gene

CIAS1

(also known as NALP3) which encodes a
    protein named cryopyrin (“icy-fire”). Currently, there
    are no medicines approved for the treatment of CAPS.

We are also evaluating the potential use of the IL-1 Trap in
    other indications in which IL-1 may play a role. Based on
    preclinical evidence that IL-1 appears to play a critical role
    in gout, we initiated a proof of concept study of the IL-1 Trap
    in gout in the first quarter of 2007. We are also preparing to
    initiate exploratory proof of concept studies of the IL-1 Trap
    in other indications.

Under a March 2003 collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma
    AG, we retain the right to elect to collaborate in the future
    development and commercialization of a Novartis IL-1 antibody,
    which is in clinical development. Following completion of
    Phase 2 development and submission to us of a written
    report on the Novartis IL-1 antibody, we have the right, in
    consideration for an opt-in payment, to elect to co-develop and
    co-commercialize the Novartis IL-1 antibody in North America. If
    we elect to exercise this right, we are responsible for paying
    45% of post-election North American development costs for the
    antibody product. In return, we are entitled to co-promote the
    Novartis IL-1 antibody and to receive 45% of net profits on
    sales of the antibody product in North America. Under certain
    circumstances, we are also entitled to receive royalties on
    sales of the Novartis IL-1 antibody in Europe.

In addition, under the collaboration agreement, Novartis has the
    right to elect to collaborate in the development and
    commercialization of a second generation IL-1 Trap following
    completion of its Phase 2 development, should we decide to
    clinically develop such a second generation product candidate.
    Novartis does not have any rights or options with respect to our
    IL-1 Trap currently in clinical development.

2.

VEGF
    Trap — Oncology

The VEGF Trap is a protein-based product candidate designed to
    bind all forms of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (called
    VEGF-A, also known as Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF) and
    the related Placental Growth Factor (called PlGF), and prevent
    their interaction with cell surface receptors. VEGF-A (and to a
    less



validated degree, PlGF) is required for the growth of new blood
    vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent
    regulator of vascular permeability and leakage.

The VEGF Trap is being developed in cancer indications in
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Currently, the collaboration
    is conducting Phase 2 studies, with patient enrollment
    underway in advanced ovarian cancer (AOC), non-small cell lung
    adenocarcinoma (NSCLA), and AOC patients with symptomatic
    malignant ascites (SMA). In 2004, the United States Food and
    Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to the
    VEGF Trap for the treatment of SMA. Sanofi-aventis reported in
    February 2007 that a registration filing is possible for the
    VEGF Trap in at least one of these single-agent indications in
    2008.

In addition, five new Phase 2 single-agent studies have
    begun in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
    Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) in relapsed/refractory
    multiple myeloma, metastatic colorectal cancer, recurrent or
    metastatic cancer of the urothelium, locally advanced or
    metastatic gynecological soft tissue sarcoma, and recurrent
    malignant gliomas. An additional study is expected to begin
    shortly in metastatic breast cancer. The companies are working
    to finalize plans with NCI/CTEP for at least four additional
    trials in different cancer types.

We and sanofi-aventis intend to initiate five Phase 3
    trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the VEGF Trap in
    combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in specific
    cancer types, the first three of which are planned to begin in
    2007. The companies plan to initiate these Phase 3 trials
    in the following indications:

•

first-line metastatic hormone resistant prostate cancer in
    combination with
    Taxotere

®

,

•

first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with
    gemcitabine-based regimen,

•

first-line gastric cancer in combination with
    Taxotere

®

,

•

second-line non-small cell lung cancer in combination with
    Taxotere

®

, and

•

second-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with
    FOLFIRI (Folinic Acid, Fluorouracil, and irinotecan).

Five safety and tolerability studies of the VEGF Trap in
    combination with standard chemotherapy regimens are continuing
    in a variety of cancer types to support the planned Phase 3
    clinical program. The companies have previously summarized
    information from two of these safety and tolerability trials.
    One study is evaluating the VEGF Trap in combination with
    oxaliplatin, 5-flourouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) in a
    Phase 1 trial of patients with advanced solid tumors.
    Another study is evaluating the VEGF Trap in combination with
    irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (LV5FU2-CPT11) in a
    Phase 1 trial of patients with advanced solid tumors.
    Abstracts published in the

2006 ASCO Annual Meeting
    Proceedings

reported that the VEGF Trap could be safely
    combined with either FOLFOX4 or LV5FU2-CPT11 at the dose levels
    studied. The companies are also evaluating the VEGF Trap in
    separate Phase 1b studies in combination with
    Taxotere

®

,
    cisplatin, and fluouracil; with
    Taxotere

®

and cisplatin; and with gemcitabine-erlotinib.

Cancer is a heterogeneous set of diseases and one of the leading
    causes of death in the developed world. A mutation in any one of
    dozens of normal genes can eventually result in a cell becoming
    cancerous; however, a common feature of cancer cells is that
    they need to obtain nutrients and remove waste products, just as
    normal cells do. The vascular system normally supplies nutrients
    to and removes waste from normal tissues. Cancer cells can use
    the vascular system either by taking over preexisting blood
    vessels or by promoting the growth of new blood vessels (a
    process known as angiogenesis). VEGF is secreted by many tumors
    to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels to supply nutrients
    and oxygen to the tumor. VEGF blockers have been shown to
    inhibit new vessel growth; and, in some cases, can cause
    regression of existing tumor vasculature. Countering the effects
    of VEGF, thereby blocking the blood supply to tumors, has
    demonstrated therapeutic benefits in clinical trials. This
    approach of inhibiting angiogenesis as a mechanism of action for
    an oncology medicine was validated in February 2004, when the
    FDA approved Genentech, Inc.’s VEGF inhibitor,
    Avastin

®

.
    Avastin is an antibody product designed to inhibit VEGF and
    interfere with the blood supply to tumors.



Collaboration
    with the sanofi-aventis Group

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
    with Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (predecessor to
    sanofi-aventis U.S.) to collaborate on the development and
    commercialization of the VEGF Trap in all countries other than
    Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap. In January 2005, we and
    sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration agreement to exclude
    from the scope of the collaboration the development and
    commercialization of the VEGF Trap for intraocular delivery to
    the eye. In December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our
    collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the
    companies are collaborating on the development of the VEGF Trap
    to include Japan. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended,
    we and sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits
    on sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap outside of Japan for disease
    indications included in our collaboration. We are entitled to a
    royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of the VEGF Trap in
    Japan, subject to certain potential adjustments. We may also
    receive up to $400.0 million in milestone payments upon
    receipt of specified marketing approvals. This total includes up
    to $360.0 million in milestone payments related to receipt
    of marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF Trap oncology and
    other indications in the United States or the European Union.
    Another $40.0 million of milestone payments relate to
    receipt of marketing approvals for up to five VEGF Trap oncology
    indications in Japan.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon
    worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during
    the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If
    the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap development
    expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of
    development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits
    and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at our option.

VEGF
    Trap — Eye Diseases

The VEGF Trap-Eye is a form of the VEGF Trap that has been
    purified and formulated with excipients and at concentrations
    suitable for direct injection into the eye. The VEGF Trap-Eye
    currently is being tested in a Phase 2 trial in patients
    with the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration
    (wet AMD) and in a small pilot study in patients with diabetic
    macular edema (DME).

In the second quarter of 2006, we initiated a 150 patient,
    12 week, Phase 2 trial of the VEGF Trap-Eye in wet
    AMD. The trial is evaluating the safety and biological effect of
    treatment with multiple doses of the VEGF Trap-Eye using
    different doses and different dosing regimens. We expect to
    report initial three-month data from the first 75 patients
    enrolled in the Phase 2 trial in early 2007 and complete
    three-month data on all 150 patients enrolled in the study
    by the end of the year. We are also conducting a Phase 1
    safety and tolerability trial of a new formulation of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in wet AMD. An initial Phase 3 trial of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in wet AMD utilizing the new formulation is planned to
    begin in the second half of 2007, and a second Phase 3
    trial is planned once the full data from the Phase 2 trial
    has been analyzed.

Also in the second quarter of 2006, we initiated a small pilot
    study of the VEGF Trap in patients with DME.

At the 2006 American Society of Retinal Specialists (ASRS)
    annual meeting in France, we updated the positive preliminary
    results from a Phase 1 trial of the VEGF Trap-Eye in
    patients with wet AMD. A total of 21 patients received a
    single dose of VEGF Trap-Eye at doses of 0.05, 0.15,
    0.5, 1, 2, and 4 milligrams (mg) intravitreally (direct
    injection into the eye). Patients were evaluated for six weeks
    to measure the durability of effects and provide guidance for
    dosing regimens to be used in future trials. All dose levels
    were generally well tolerated, and a maximum tolerated dose was
    not reached in the study. In wet AMD, the leakiness of the
    abnormal blood vessels in the eye can lead to increased retinal
    thickness. On average, patients receiving the VEGF Trap-Eye
    demonstrated large, rapid, and sustained (at least six weeks)
    reductions in retinal thickness. Excess retinal thickness, as
    determined by ocular coherence tomography (OCT), is a clinical
    measure of disease activity in wet AMD. As measured by the OCT
    reading center (posterior pole OCT scans), the median excess
    retinal thickness resulting from the disease process was 194
    microns at baseline. Following a single intravitreal dose of the
    VEGF Trap-Eye, median excess retinal thickness was reduced to 60
    microns, an improvement that was sustained over a six week
    period. As measured by the computerized Fast Macular Scan
    protocol, the median excess retinal thickness was 119 microns at
    baseline, which was reduced to 27 microns at six weeks after the
    single dose of the VEGF Trap-Eye.



Of the 20 patients evaluable for efficacy, 95 percent
    had stabilization or improvement in visual acuity, defined as 15
    letter loss on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study
    (ETDRS) eye chart. Patients were also evaluated for
    best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the best acuity a person
    can achieve with glasses. BCVA for all patients in the study
    increased by a mean of 4.8 letters at six weeks. In the two
    highest dose groups (2 mg and 4 mg), the mean
    improvement in BCVA was 13.5 letters, with three of six patients
    showing an improvement in BCVA of 15 or more letters.

VEGF-A both stimulates angiogenesis and increases vascular
    permeability. It has been shown in preclinical studies to be a
    major pathogenic factor in both wet AMD and diabetic
    retinopathy, and it is believed to be involved in other medical
    problems affecting the eyes. In clinical trials, blocking VEGF-A
    has been shown to be effective in patients with wet AMD, and
    Macugen

®

(OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and
    Lucentis

®

(Genentech, Inc.) have been approved to treat patients with this
    condition.

Wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are two of the leading
    causes of adult blindness in the developed world. In both
    conditions, severe vision loss is caused by a combination of
    retinal edema and neovascular proliferation. It is estimated
    that in the U.S. 6% of individuals aged

65-74

and
    20% of those older than 75 are affected with wet AMD. DR is a
    major complication of diabetes mellitus that can lead to
    significant vision impairment. DR is characterized, in part, by
    vascular leakage, which results in the collection of fluid in
    the retina. When the macula, the central area of the retina that
    is responsible for fine visual acuity, is involved, loss of
    visual acuity occurs. This is referred to as diabetic macular
    edema (DME). DME is the most prevalent cause of moderate visual
    loss in patients with diabetes.

Collaboration
    with Bayer HealthCare

In October 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Bayer HealthCare for the global development, and
    commercialization outside the United States, of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye. Under the agreement we and Bayer will collaborate on,
    and share the costs of, the development of the VEGF Trap-Eye
    through an integrated global plan that encompasses wet AMD,
    diabetic eye diseases, and other diseases and disorders. The
    companies will share equally in profits from any future sales of
    the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States. If the VEGF
    Trap-Eye is granted marketing authorization in a major market
    country outside the United States and the collaboration becomes
    profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Bayer for 50% of
    the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement
    from our share of the collaboration profits. Within the United
    States, we retained exclusive commercialization rights to the
    VEGF Trap-Eye and are entitled to all profits from any such
    sales. We received an up-front payment of $75.0 million
    from Bayer and can earn up to $110.0 million in total
    development and regulatory milestones related to the development
    of the VEGF Trap-Eye and marketing approvals in major market
    countries outside the United States. We can also earn up to
    $135.0 million in sales milestones if total annual sales of
    the VEGF Trap outside the United States achieve certain
    specified levels starting at $200 million.

Research
    Technologies:

One way that a cell communicates with other cells is by
    releasing specific signaling proteins, either locally or into
    the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct functions, and are
    classified into different “families” of molecules,
    such as peptide hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. All of
    these secreted (or signaling) proteins travel to and are
    recognized by another set of proteins, called
    “receptors,” which reside on the surface of responding
    cells. These secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and
    biological processes, causing diverse effects ranging from the
    regulation of growth of particular cell types, to inflammation
    mediated by white blood cells. Secreted proteins can at times be
    overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases. In these
    disease settings, blocking the action of secreted proteins can
    have clinical benefit.

Regeneron scientists have developed two different technologies
    to design protein therapeutics to block the action of specific
    secreted proteins. The first technology, termed the
    “Trap” technology, was used to generate our current
    clinical pipeline, including the VEGF Trap, the VEGF Trap-Eye,
    and the IL-1 Trap. These novel “Traps” are composed of
    fusions between two distinct receptor components and the
    constant region of an antibody molecule called the “Fc
    region”, resulting in high affinity product candidates.



Regeneron scientists also have discovered and developed a new
    technology for designing protein therapeutics that focuses on
    the discovery and production of fully human monoclonal
    antibodies. We call our technology

and, as described below, believe that it is a unique way
    of generating a wide variety of high affinity therapeutic, human
    monoclonal antibodies.

VelocImmune

®

(Human Monoclonal Antibodies)

We have developed a novel mouse technology platform, called
    VelocImmune, for producing fully human monoclonal antibodies.
    The VelocImmune mouse platform was generated by exploiting our
    VelociGene technology platform (see below), in a process in
    which six megabases of mouse immune gene loci were replaced or
    “humanized” with corresponding human immune gene loci.
    The VelocImmune mice can be used to generate efficiently fully
    human monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic interest.
    VelocImmune and our related technologies offer the potential to
    increase the speed and efficiency through which human monoclonal
    antibody therapeutics may be discovered and validated, thereby
    improving the overall efficiency of our early stage drug
    development activities. We are utilizing the VelocImmune
    technology to produce our next generation of drug candidates for
    preclinical development and are exploring possible licensing or
    collaborative arrangements with third parties related to
    VelocImmune and related technologies.

License
    Agreement with AstraZeneca

In February 2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license
    agreement with AstraZeneca that will allow AstraZeneca to
    utilize our VelocImmune technology in its internal research
    programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies. Under the
    terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million
    non-refundable up-front payment to us. AstraZeneca also will
    make up to five additional annual payments of
    $20.0 million, subject to its ability to terminate the
    agreement after making the first three additional payments or
    earlier if the technology does not meet minimum performance
    criteria. We are entitled to receive a mid-single-digit royalty
    on any future sales of antibody products discovered by
    AstraZeneca using our VelocImmune technology.

(Target Validation)

Our VelociGene platform allows custom and precise manipulation
    of very large sequences of DNA to produce highly customized
    alterations of a specified target gene and accelerates the
    production of knock-out and transgenic expression models without
    using either positive/negative selection or isogenic DNA. In
    producing knock-out models, a color or fluorescent marker is
    substituted in place of the actual gene sequence, allowing for
    high-resolution visualization of precisely where the gene is
    active in the body, during normal body functioning, as well as
    in disease processes. For the optimization of pre-clinical
    development and toxicology programs, VelociGene offers the
    opportunity to humanize targets by replacing the mouse gene with
    the human homolog. Thus, VelociGene allows scientists to rapidly
    identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or
    over-expressing the target gene, as well as to characterize and
    test potential therapeutic molecules.

The VelociMouse technology also allows for the direct and
    immediate generation of genetically altered mice from
    ES cells, thereby avoiding the lengthy process involved in
    generating and breeding knockout mice from chimeras. Mice
    generated through this method are normal and healthy and exhibit
    a 100% germ-line transmission frequency. Furthermore,
    Regeneron’s VelociMice are suitable for direct phenotyping
    or other studies.

National
    Institutes of Health Grant

In September 2006, we were awarded a five-year grant from the
    National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the NIH’s
    Knockout Mouse Project. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Project
    is to build a comprehensive and broadly available resource of
    knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function
    and human diseases. We will use our VelociGene technology to
    take aim at 3,500 of the most difficult genes to target and
    which are not currently the focus of other large-scale knockout
    mouse programs. We have also agreed to grant a limited license
    to a consortium of research institutions, the other major
    participants in the Knockout Mouse Project, to use components of
    our VelociGene technology in the Knockout Mouse Project. We will
    generate a collection of targeting vectors and targeted mouse
    embryonic stem cells (ES cells) which can be used to
    produce knockout mice.



These materials will be made widely available to academic
    researchers without charge. We will receive a fee for each
    targeted ES cell line or targeting construct made by us or the
    research consortium and transferred to commercial entities.

Under the NIH grant, we will be entitled to receive a minimum of
    $17.9 million over a five-year period. We will receive
    another $1.0 million to optimize our existing C57BL/6 ES
    cell line and its proprietary growth medium, both of which will
    be supplied to the research consortium for its use in the
    Knockout Mouse Project. We will have the right to use, for any
    purpose, all materials generated by us and the research
    consortium.

Cell
    Line Expression Technologies

Many proteins that are of potential pharmaceutical value are
    proteins which are “secreted” from the cells into the
    bloodstream. Examples of secreted proteins include growth
    factors (such as insulin and growth hormone) and antibodies.
    Current technologies for the isolation of cells engineered to
    produce high levels of secreted proteins are both laborious and
    time consuming. We have developed enabling platforms for the
    high-throughput, rapid generation of high-producing cell lines
    for our Traps and VelocImmune human monoclonal antibodies.

Research
    Programs

:

Oncology
    and Angiogenesis

In many clinical settings, positively or negatively regulating
    blood vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits,
    as could the repair of damaged and leaky vessels. Vascular
    Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) was the first growth factor
    shown to be specific for blood vessels, by virtue of having its
    receptor specifically expressed on blood vessel cells. In 1994,
    we discovered a second family of angiogenic growth factors,
    termed the Angiopoietins, and we have received patents covering
    members of this family. The Angiopoietins include naturally
    occurring positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis, as
    described in numerous scientific manuscripts published by our
    scientists and their collaborators. The Angiopoietins are being
    evaluated in preclinical research by us and our academic
    collaborators. Our preclinical studies have revealed that VEGF
    and the Angiopoietins normally function in a coordinated and
    collaborative manner during blood vessel growth. Manipulation of
    both VEGF and Angiopoietins seems to be of value in blocking
    vessel growth. We have research programs focusing on several
    targets in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis.

Tumors depend on the growth of new blood vessels (a process
    called “angiogenesis”) to support their continued
    growth. Therapies that block tumor angiogenesis, specifically
    those that block VEGF, the key initiator of tumor angiogenesis,
    recently have been validated in human cancer patients. However,
    anti-VEGF approaches do not work in all patients, and many
    tumors can become resistant to such therapies.

In the December 21, 2006 issue of the journal

Nature,

we reported data from a preclinical study demonstrating that
    blocking an important cell signaling molecule, known as
    Delta-like Ligand 4 (Dll4), inhibited the growth of experimental
    tumors by interfering with their ability to produce a functional
    blood supply. The inhibition of tumor growth was seen in a
    variety of tumor types, including those that were resistant to
    blockade of VEGF, suggesting a novel anti-angiogenesis
    therapeutic approach. A fully human monoclonal antibody to Dll4,
    that was discovered using our VelocImmune technology, is in
    preclinical development.

Metabolic
    and Related Diseases

Food intake and metabolism are regulated by complex interactions
    between diverse neural and hormonal signals that serve to
    maintain an optimal balance between energy intake, storage, and
    utilization. The hypothalamus, a small area at the base of the
    brain, is critically involved in the integration of peripheral
    signals which reflect nutritional status and neural outputs
    which regulate appetite, food seeking behaviors, and energy
    expenditure. Metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes,
    reflect a dysregulation in the systems which ordinarily tightly
    couple energy intake to energy expenditure. Our preclinical
    research program in this area encompasses the study of
    peripheral (hormonal) regulators of food intake and metabolism
    in health and disease. We have identified several targets in
    these therapeutic areas and are evaluating potential antibodies
    to evaluate in preclinical studies.



Muscle
    Diseases and Disorders

Muscle atrophy occurs in many neuromuscular diseases and also
    when muscle is unused, as often occurs during prolonged hospital
    stays and during convalescence. Currently, physicians have few
    options to treat subjects with muscle atrophy or other muscle
    conditions which afflict millions of people globally. Thus, a
    treatment that has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle could
    have significant clinical benefit. Our muscle research program
    is currently focused on conducting in vivo and in vitro
    experiments with the objective of demonstrating and further
    understanding the molecular pathways involved in muscle atrophy
    and hypertrophy, and discovering therapeutic candidates that can
    modulate these pathways. We have several molecules in late stage
    research and are evaluating them for possible further
    development.

Other
    Therapeutic Areas

We have research programs focusing on inflammatory and immune
    diseases, pain, bone and cartilage, ophthalmology, and
    cardiovascular diseases.

Manufacturing

In 1993, we purchased our 104,000 square foot Rensselaer,
    New York manufacturing facility, and in 2003 completed a
    19,500 square foot expansion. This facility is used to
    manufacture therapeutic candidates for our own preclinical and
    clinical studies. We also used the facility to manufacture a
    product for Merck & Co., Inc. under a contract that
    expired in October 2006. In July 2002, we leased
    75,000 square feet in a building near our Rensselaer
    facility which is being used for the manufacture of Traps and
    for warehouse space. At December 31, 2006, we employed
    188 people at these owned and leased manufacturing
    facilities. There were no impairment losses associated with
    long-lived assets at these facilities as of December 31,
    2006.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a
    medicine is the requirement that the prospective
    manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
    conform to the GMP regulations of the health authority. In
    complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
    manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in
    the areas of production and quality control to ensure full
    technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign
    and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the
    authority of the FDA and by other national, federal, state, and
    local agencies. If our manufacturing facilities fail to comply
    with FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be required
    to suspend manufacturing. This will have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and
    cash flow.

Competition

We face substantial competition from pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology, and chemical companies (see “Risk
    Factors —

Even if our product candidates are ever
    approved, their commercial success is highly uncertain because
    our competitors may get to the marketplace before we do with
    better or lower cost drugs or the market for our product
    candidates may be too small to support commercialization or
    sufficient profitability

.”). Our competitors may
    include Genentech, Novartis, Pfizer Inc., OSI Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc., Bayer HealthCare, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Abbott
    Laboratories, sanofi-aventis, Merck, Amgen, Roche, and others.
    Many of our competitors have substantially greater research,
    preclinical, and clinical product development and manufacturing
    capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than
    we do. Our smaller competitors may also be significant if they
    acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
    arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
    if we achieve product commercialization, one or more of our
    competitors may achieve product commercialization earlier than
    we do or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely
    affects our activities. Our ability to compete will depend on
    how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates,
    complete clinical testing and approval processes, and supply
    commercial quantities of the product to the market. Competition
    among product candidates approved for sale will also be based on
    efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent
    position, and other factors.

VEGF Trap and VEGF Trap-Eye.

Many companies
    are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block the
    actions of VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A
    variety of approaches have been employed, including antibodies
    to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF receptor, small molecule
    antagonists to the VEGF receptor



tyrosine kinase, and other anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of
    these alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to
    our VEGF Trap in efficacy, side-effect profile, or method of
    delivery. Additionally, some of these molecules are either
    already approved for marketing or are at a more advanced stage
    of development than our product candidate.

In particular, Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
    Avastin

®

,
    on the market for treating certain cancers and a number of
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to
    develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, OSI
    Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Imclone Systems Incorporated. Many
    of these molecules are further along in development than the
    VEGF Trap and may offer competitive advantages over our
    molecule

.

Novartis has an ongoing Phase 3 clinical
    development program evaluating an orally delivered VEGF tyrosine
    kinase inhibitor in different cancer settings. Each of Pfizer
    and Onyx Pharmaceuticals (together with its partner Bayer) has
    received approval from the FDA to market and sell an oral
    medication that targets tumor cell growth and new vasculature
    formation that fuels the growth of tumors.

The market for eye disease products is also very competitive.
    Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the
    commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody
    fragment
    (Lucentis

®

)
    for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD)
    and other eye indications that was approved by the FDA in June
    2006. OSI Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer are marketing an approved
    VEGF inhibitor
    (Macugen

®

)
    for wet AMD. Many other companies are working on the development
    of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD
    that act by blocking VEGF, VEGF receptors, and through the use
    of soluble ribonucleic acids (sRNAs) that modulate gene
    expression. In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label a
    third-party reformulated version of Genentech’s approved
    VEGF antagonist, Avastin, with success for the treatment of wet
    AMD. The National Eye Institue recently has received funding for
    a Phase 3 trial to compare Lucentis to Avastin in the
    treatment of wet AMD.

IL-1 Trap.

The availability of highly
    effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists such as
    Enbrel

®

(Amgen),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret (Amgen), and
    other marketed therapies makes it difficult to successfully
    develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap. Even if the IL-1Trap is
    ever approved for sale, it will be difficult for our drug to
    compete against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists because
    doctors and patients will have significant experience using
    these effective medicines. Moreover, there are both small
    molecules and antibodies in development by third parties that
    are designed to block the synthesis of interleukin-1 or inhibit
    the signaling of interleukin-1. For example, Eli Lilly and
    Company and Novartis are each developing antibodies to
    interleukin-1 and Amgen is developing an antibody to the
    interleukin-1 receptor. These drug candidates could offer
    competitive advantages over the IL-1 Trap. The successful
    development of these competing molecules could delay or impair
    our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the IL-1
    Trap.

Other Areas.

Many pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies are attempting to discover new
    therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time
    and resources. In these and related areas, intellectual property
    rights have been sought and certain rights have been granted to
    competitors and potential competitors of ours, and we may be at
    a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result
    of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained
    personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic
    competitors are involved in the discovery and development of
    novel therapeutics that are the focus of other research or
    development programs we are now conducting. These competitors
    include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many others. Many firms
    and entities are engaged in research and development in the
    areas of cytokines, interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle
    conditions. Some of these competitors are currently conducting
    advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these
    areas. These and other competitors may have established
    substantial intellectual property and other competitive
    advantages.

If a competitor announces a successful clinical study involving
    a product that may be competitive with one of our product
    candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory
    agency for a competitive product, the announcement may have an
    adverse effect on our operations or future prospects or on the
    market price of our common stock.

We also compete with academic institutions, governmental
    agencies, and other public or private research organizations,
    which conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish
    collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of
    products that would provide royalties or other consideration for
    use of their technology. These institutions are becoming more
    active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements
    to



collect royalties or other consideration for use of the
    technology that they have developed. Products developed in this
    manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also
    compete with others in acquiring technology from these
    institutions, agencies, and organizations.

Patents,
    Trademarks, and Trade Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents,
    maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing
    on the proprietary rights of third parties (see “Risk
    Factors —

We may be restricted in our development

and/or

commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage
    awards if we are found to have infringed, third party patents or
    other proprietary rights

.”). Our policy is to file
    patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and
    improvements that we consider important to our business and
    operations. We are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of
    additional U.S. patents and patent applications. We also
    rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological
    innovation in an effort to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We or our licensors or collaborators have filed patent
    applications on various products and processes relating to our
    product candidates as well as other technologies and inventions
    in the United States and in certain foreign countries. We intend
    to file additional patent applications, when appropriate,
    relating to improvements in these technologies and other
    specific products and processes. We plan to aggressively
    prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents and other proprietary
    technology.

Patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in
    the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are
    subject to this additional uncertainty. Others may independently
    develop similar products or processes to those developed by us,
    duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are
    issued to us, design around any products and processes covered
    by our patents. We expect to continue, when appropriate, to file
    product and process patent applications with respect to our
    inventions. However, we may not file any such applications or,
    if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or
    licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of
    others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can
    be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is
    favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued to or
    licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may
    find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third
    parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the
    development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into
    account patent rights of third parties.

Government
    Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the United States and
    foreign countries is a significant factor in the research,
    development, manufacture, and marketing of our product
    candidates (see “Risk Factors —

If we do not
    obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will
    not be able to market or sell them.”).

All of our
    product candidates will require regulatory approval before they
    can be commercialized. In particular, human therapeutic products
    are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and
    other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA and foreign
    authorities. Many aspects of the structure and substance of the
    FDA and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been
    reformed during recent years, and continued reform is under
    consideration in a number of jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome
    and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be
    predicted.

The activities required before a product candidate may be
    marketed in the United States begin with preclinical tests.
    Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal
    studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the
    product candidate and its formulations. The results of these
    studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an
    Investigational New Drug Application, which must be reviewed by
    the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically,
    clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In
    Phase 1, trials are conducted with a small number of
    subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product
    candidate. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with
    subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to
    provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety,
    tolerability, and efficacy of different potential doses of the
    product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials
    are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific disease
    or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand the
    efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as
    required by the FDA. The results of the preclinical and clinical
    testing of a biologic product candidate are then submitted to
    the FDA in the form of a



Biologics License Application, or BLA, for evaluation to
    determine whether the product candidate may be approved for
    commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant
    marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the
    application.

Any approval required by the FDA for any of our product
    candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The
    designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase
    is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be
    sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and
    a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase
    notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a
    particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or early
    stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or
    efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more
    broadly in humans.

Approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory
    authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to
    commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The
    approval procedure varies among countries and may involve
    additional testing, and the time required to obtain such
    approval may differ from that required for FDA approval.

Various federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations
    also govern or influence the research, manufacture, safety,
    labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport, and
    other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates. The lengthy
    process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with
    applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of
    substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or
    licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory
    approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing
    of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty
    revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and future business
    will be subject to regulation under the United States Atomic
    Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances
    Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
    national restrictions, and other current and potential future
    local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Business
    Segments

Through 2006, our operations were managed in two business
    segments: research and development, and contract manufacturing.
    The research and development segment includes all activities
    related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products for the
    treatment of serious medical conditions, and the development and
    commercialization of these discoveries. It also includes
    revenues and expenses related to (i) the development of
    manufacturing processes prior to commencing commercial
    production of a product under contract manufacturing
    arrangements and (ii) the supply of specified, ordered
    research materials using Regeneron-developed proprietary
    technology. The contract manufacturing segment includes all
    revenues and expenses related to the commercial production of
    products under contract manufacturing arrangements. During 2006,
    2005, and 2004, the Company manufactured a product for Merck
    under a contract that expired in October 2006. For financial
    information about these segments, see Note 20,
    “Segment Information”, beginning on

page F-34

in our Financial Statements. Due to the expiration of our
    manufacturing agreement with Merck, beginning in 2007 we only
    have a research and development business segment.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had 573 full-time
    employees, of whom 80 held a Ph.D. or M.D. degree or both. We
    believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and
    experienced personnel in a highly competitive environment;
    however, competition for these personnel is intense. None of our
    personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and
    our management considers its relations with our employees to be
    good.

Available
    Information

We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy
    statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    or the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials
    that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference
    Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW,



Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the
    operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at

1-800-SEC-0330.

Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains
    reports, proxy and information statements, and other information
    regarding issuers, including Regeneron, that file electronically
    with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file
    with the SEC at

    electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the
    SEC.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We operate in an environment that involves a number of
    significant risks and uncertainties. We caution you to read the
    following risk factors, which have affected,

and/or

in
    the future could affect, our business, operating results,
    financial condition, and cash flows. The risks described below
    include forward-looking statements, and actual events and our
    actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in
    these forward-looking statements. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
    Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties are described
    under other captions in this report and should be considered by
    our investors.

Risks
    Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Additional
    Financing

We
    have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve
    profitability. If we continue to incur operating losses, we may
    be unable to continue our operations.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
    2006, we had a cumulative loss of $687.6 million. If we
    continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a
    profitable company, we may be unable to continue our operations.
    We have no products that are available for sale and do not know
    when we will have products available for sale, if ever. In the
    absence of revenue from the sale of products or other sources,
    the amount, timing, nature or source of which cannot be
    predicted, our losses will continue as we conduct our research
    and development activities. Until October 31, 2006, we
    received contract manufacturing revenue from our agreement with
    Merck and, until June 30, 2005, we received contract
    research and development revenue from our agreement with The
    Procter & Gamble Company. Our agreement with
    Procter & Gamble expired in June 2005 and our agreement
    with Merck expired in October 2006. The expiration of these
    agreements has resulted in a significant loss of revenue to the
    Company.

We
    will need additional funding in the future, which may not be
    available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce or
    eliminate our product development programs or commercialization
    efforts.

We will need to expend substantial resources for research and
    development, including costs associated with clinical testing of
    our product candidates. We believe our existing capital
    resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at
    least early 2010, without taking into consideration the
    $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
    senior subordinated notes, which mature in October 2008;
    however, our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may
    increase and that would lead to our capital being consumed
    significantly before such time. We will likely require
    additional financing in the future and we may not be able to
    raise such additional funds. If we are able to obtain additional
    financing through the sale of equity or convertible debt
    securities, such sales may be dilutive to our shareholders. Debt
    financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets
    or enter into covenants that would restrict our business
    activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may
    contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders.
    If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the
    development of our product candidates, we may face delay,
    reduction or elimination of our research and development
    programs or preclinical or clinical trials, in which case our
    business, financial condition or results of operations may be
    materially harmed.



We
    have a significant amount of debt and may have insufficient cash
    to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations. In
    addition, the amount of our debt could impede our operations and
    flexibility.

We have a significant amount of convertible debt and semi-annual
    interest payment obligations. This debt, unless converted to
    shares of our common stock, will mature in October 2008. We may
    be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain
    funds necessary to make required payments on our debt. Even if
    we are able to meet our debt service obligations, the amount of
    debt we already have could hurt our ability to obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service requirements, or other purposes. In
    addition, our debt obligations could require us to use a
    substantial portion of cash to pay principal and interest on our
    debt, instead of applying those funds to other purposes, such as
    research and development, working capital, and capital
    expenditures.

Risks
    Related to Development of Our Product Candidates

Successful
    development of any of our product candidates is highly
    uncertain.

Only a small minority of all research and development programs
    ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We have
    never developed a drug that has been approved for marketing and
    sale, and we may never succeed in developing an approved drug.
    Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness of
    any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the
    necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial
    success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their
    acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party
    payers and on our partners’ ability to successfully
    manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Our
    product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion
    or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are
    generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule
    delivery. If our products are not successfully commercialized,
    we will not be able to recover the significant investment we
    have made in developing such products and our business would be
    severely harmed.

We intend to study our lead product candidates, the VEGF Trap,
    VEGF Trap-Eye, and IL-1 Trap, in a wide variety of indications.
    We intend to study the VEGF Trap in a variety of cancer
    settings, the VEGF Trap-Eye in different eye diseases and
    ophthalmologic indications, and the IL-1 Trap in a variety of
    systemic inflammatory disorders. Many of these current trials
    are exploratory studies designed to identify what diseases and
    uses, if any, are best suited for our product candidates. It is
    likely that our product candidates will not demonstrate the
    requisite efficacy

and/or

safety profile to support continued development for most of the
    indications that are to be studied. In fact, our product
    candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and safety
    profile to support the continued development for any of the
    indications or uses.

Clinical
    trials required for our product candidates are expensive and
    time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. If any of
    our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results, we
    will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory
    approval for our product candidates.

We must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates
    before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell
    them. We need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and
    human clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a lengthy,
    time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and trials
    may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including,
    among others, failure of the product candidate to demonstrate
    safety or efficacy, the development of serious or
    life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or
    connected with exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in
    enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial, lack
    of sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator
    drug, and the failure of clinical investigators, trial monitors
    and other consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the
    trial plan or protocol. A clinical trial may fail because it did
    not include a sufficient number of patients to detect the
    endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance. A
    clinical trial may also fail because the dose(s) of the
    investigational drug included in the trial were either too low
    or too high to determine the optimal effect of the
    investigational drug in the disease setting. For example, we are
    studying higher doses of the IL-1 Trap in different diseases
    after a Phase 2 trial using lower doses of the IL-1 Trap in
    subjects with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its primary
    endpoint.

We will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test
    favorably and either conduct new trials, which are expensive and
    time consuming, or abandon the drug development program. Even if
    we obtain positive results



from preclinical or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same
    success in future trials. Many companies in the
    biopharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered
    significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising
    results have been obtained in earlier trials. The failure of
    clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the
    desired indication(s) could harm the development of the product
    candidate(s), and our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations may be materially harmed.

The
    data from the Phase 3 clinical program for the IL-1 Trap in
    CAPS (Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndromes) may be inadequate
    to support regulatory approval for commercialization of the IL-1
    Trap.

The efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 clinical
    program for the IL-1 Trap in CAPS may be inadequate to support
    approval for its commercialization in this indication. Moreover,
    if the safety data from the ongoing clinical trials testing the
    IL-1 Trap are not satisfactory, we may not proceed with the
    filing of a biological license application, or BLA, for the IL-1
    Trap or we may be forced to delay the filing. The FDA and other
    regulatory agencies may have varying interpretations of our
    clinical trial data, which could delay, limit, or prevent
    regulatory approval or clearance.

Further, before a product candidate is approved for marketing,
    our manufacturing facilities must be inspected by the FDA and
    the FDA will not approve the product for marketing if we or our
    third party manufacturers are not in compliance with current
    good manufacturing practices. Even if the FDA and similar
    foreign regulatory authorities do grant marketing approval for
    the IL-1 Trap, they may pose restrictions on the use or
    marketing of the product, or may require us to conduct
    additional post-marketing trials. These restrictions and
    requirements would likely result in increased expenditures and
    lower revenues and may restrict our ability to commercialize the
    IL-1 Trap profitably.

In addition to the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations
    in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign
    regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials,
    marketing and approval for drugs, and commercial sales and
    distribution of drugs in foreign countries. The foreign
    regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated
    with FDA approval as well as country-specific regulations.
    Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product in the
    United States, we must obtain approval by the comparable
    regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can
    commence clinical trials or marketing of the IL-1 Trap in those
    countries.

The
    development of serious or life-threatening side effects with any
    of our product candidates would lead to delay or discontinuation
    of development, which could severely harm our
    business.

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes
    in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts,
    to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine
    whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these
    conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have
    been reported from

time-to-time

during clinical trials of our product candidates. It is possible
    as we test our current drug candidates in larger, longer, and
    more extensive clinical programs, illnesses, injuries, and
    discomforts that were observed in earlier trials, as well as
    conditions that did not occur or went undetected in smaller
    previous trials, will be reported by patients. Many times, side
    effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are
    tested in large scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some
    cases, after they are made available to patients after approval.
    If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our
    product candidates has many side effects or causes serious or
    life-threatening side effects, the development of the product
    candidate may fail or be delayed, which would severely harm our
    business.

Our VEGF Trap is being studied for the potential treatment of
    certain types of cancer and our VEGF Trap-Eye candidate is being
    studied in diseases of the eye. There are many potential safety
    concerns associated with significant blockade of vascular
    endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. These risks, based on the
    clinical and preclinical experience of systemically delivered
    VEGF inhibitors, including the systemic delivery of the VEGF
    Trap, include bleeding, hypertension, and proteinuria. These
    serious side effects and other serious side effects have been
    reported in our systemic VEGF Trap studies in cancer and
    diseases of the eye. In addition, patients given infusions of
    any protein, including the VEGF Trap delivered through
    intravenous administration, may develop severe hypersensitivity
    reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF blockers have
    reported side effects that became evident only after large scale
    trials or after marketing approval and large numbers of patients
    were treated. These include side effects that we have not yet
    seen in our trials such as heart attack and stroke. These and
    other



complications or side effects could harm the development of the
    VEGF Trap for the treatment of cancer or the VEGF Trap-Eye for
    the treatment of diseases of the eye.

It is possible that safety or tolerability concerns may arise as
    we test higher doses of the IL-1 Trap in patients with other
    inflammatory diseases and disorders. Like TNF-antagonists such
    as
    Enbrel

®

(Amgen) and
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), the IL-1 Trap affects the immune defense system of
    the body by blocking some of its functions. Therefore, there may
    be an increased risk for infections to develop in patients
    treated with the IL-1 Trap. In addition, patients given
    infusions of the IL-1 Trap have developed hypersensitivity
    reactions or infusion reactions. These or other complications or
    side effects could impede or result in us abandoning the
    development of the IL-1 Trap.

Our
    product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that
    could cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of
    harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic
    protein.

In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and
    regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the
    administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an
    immune response, resulting in the production of antibodies
    against the therapeutic protein. The antibodies can have no
    effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the
    protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain a
    therapeutic effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react
    with the patient’s own proteins, resulting in an
    “auto-immune” type disease. Whether antibodies will be
    created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical
    experiments, and their detection or appearance is often delayed,
    so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies
    will not be detected at a later date — in some cases
    even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Subjects
    who received IL-1 Trap in clinical trials have developed
    antibodies. It is possible that as we test the VEGF Trap and
    VEGF Trap-Eye with more sensitive assays in different patient
    populations and larger clinical trials, we will find that
    subjects given the VEGF Trap and VEGF Trap-Eye produce
    antibodies to these product candidates, which could adversely
    impact the development of such candidates.

We may
    be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in
    a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial
    use.

Changes in product formulations and manufacturing processes may
    be required as product candidates progress in clinical
    development and are ultimately commercialized. For example, we
    are currently testing a new formulation of the VEGF Trap-Eye in
    a Phase 1 Trial. If we are unable to develop suitable
    product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large
    scale clinical testing of our product candidates, including the
    VEGF Trap, VEGF Trap-Eye, and IL-1 Trap, we may be unable to
    supply necessary materials for our clinical trials, which would
    delay the development of our product candidates. Similarly, if
    we are unable to supply sufficient quantities of our product or
    develop product formulations suitable for commercial use, we
    will not be able to successfully commercialize our product
    candidates.

Risks
    Related to Intellectual Property

If we
    cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our
    patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our
    business and competitive position will be harmed.

Our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology
    and other information that we protect as trade secrets. We seek
    to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through
    confidentiality agreements. If our trade secrets are improperly
    exposed, either by our own employees or our collaborators, it
    would help our competitors and adversely affect our business. We
    will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized
    use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are
    covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
    maintained as trade secrets. The patent position of
    biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual
    questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted
    with certainty. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated, or
    circumvented. Patent applications filed outside the United
    States may be challenged by third parties who file an
    opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly common
    in the European Union and are costly to defend. We have patent
    applications that are being opposed and it is likely that we
    will need to defend additional patent applications in the
    future. Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary
    position or



competitive advantages against competitors. Furthermore, even if
    the outcome is favorable to us, the enforcement of our
    intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time
    consuming.

We may
    be restricted in our development

and/or

commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage
    awards if we are found to have infringed, third party patents or
    other proprietary rights.

Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to
    operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary
    rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that they have
    blocking patents to our products in clinical development, either
    because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition
    of a product or the way it is manufactured or used. Moreover,
    other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to
    antibody products made using our VelocImmune technology, either
    because of the way the antibodies are discovered or produced or
    because of a proprietary position covering an antibody or the
    antibody’s target.

We are aware of patents and pending applications owned by
    Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptor
    compositions. Although we do not believe that the VEGF Trap or
    VEGF Trap-Eye infringes any valid claim in these patents or
    patent applications, Genentech could initiate a lawsuit for
    patent infringement and assert its patents are valid and cover
    the VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap-Eye. Genentech may be motivated to
    initiate such a lawsuit at some point in an effort to impair our
    ability to develop and sell the VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap-Eye,
    which represents a potential competitive threat to
    Genentech’s VEGF-binding products and product candidates.
    An adverse determination by a court in any such potential patent
    litigation would likely materially harm our business by
    requiring us to seek a license, which may not be available, or
    resulting in our inability to manufacture, develop and sell the
    VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap-Eye or in a damage award.

Any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent
    us from manufacturing, selling, or developing our drug
    candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly
    issued patents of third parties. In the event that the
    manufacture, use, or sale of any of our clinical candidates
    infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of
    third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product
    development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our drugs
    and may be required to pay costly damages. Such a result may
    materially harm our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations. Legal disputes are likely to be costly and time
    consuming to defend.

We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment,
    such licenses are needed. If any licenses are required, we may
    not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable
    terms, if at all. The failure to obtain any such license could
    prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of
    our product candidates, which could severely harm our business.

Regulatory
    and Litigation Risks

If we
    do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we
    will not be able to market or sell them.

We cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval.
    If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our
    product candidates, the value of our company and our results of
    operations will be harmed. In the United States, we must obtain
    and maintain approval from the FDA for each drug we intend to
    sell. Obtaining FDA approval is typically a lengthy and
    expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain. Foreign
    governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and
    approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive
    process, and approval is highly uncertain. None of our product
    candidates has ever received regulatory approval to be marketed
    and sold in the United States or any other country. We may never
    receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA
    requires that the facilities at which the product will be
    manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing
    practices, or cGMP requirements. Manufacturing product
    candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is
    complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our
    products must be manufactured for development, and following
    approval in commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory
    requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any of our
    product collaborators or third-party manufacturers, product
    packagers, or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory



compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including,
    among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for
    a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing
    approval. As a result, our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations may be materially harmed.

If the
    testing or use of our products harms people, we could be subject
    to costly and damaging product liability claims. We could also
    face costly and damaging claims arising from employment law,
    securities law, environmental law, or other applicable laws
    governing our operations.

The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use
    in people expose us to product liability risk. Any informed
    consent or waivers obtained from people who are enrolled in our
    clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of
    litigation. Our product liability insurance may not cover all
    potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability
    arising from any such litigation. Moreover, we may not have
    access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our
    insurance on acceptable terms.

Our
    operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to
    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. We may
    incur substantial liability arising from our activities
    involving the use of hazardous materials.

As a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing
    operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health,
    and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the
    use of hazardous materials. Our research and development and
    manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of
    chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous
    materials. The cost of compliance with environmental, health,
    and safety regulations is substantial. If an accident involving
    these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we
    could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face
    regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or
    insurance coverage.

Changes
    in the securities laws and regulations have increased, and are
    likely to continue to increase, our costs.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which became law in July 2002,
    has required changes in some of our corporate governance,
    securities disclosure and compliance practices. Pursuant to the
    requirements of that Act, the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market
    have promulgated rules and listing standards covering a variety
    of subjects. Compliance with these new rules and listing
    standards has increased our legal costs, and significantly
    increased our accounting and auditing costs, and we expect these
    costs to continue. These developments may make it more difficult
    and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and
    officers’ liability insurance. Likewise, these developments
    may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain
    qualified members of our board of directors, particularly
    independent directors, or qualified executive officers.

Risks
    Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties

If our
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis for the VEGF Trap is
    terminated, our business operations and our ability to develop,
    manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap in the time
    expected, or at all, would be harmed.

We rely heavily on sanofi-aventis to assist with the development
    of the VEGF Trap oncology program. Sanofi-aventis funds all of
    the development expenses incurred by both companies in
    connection with the VEGF Trap oncology program. If the VEGF Trap
    oncology program continues, we will rely on sanofi-aventis to
    assist with funding the VEGF Trap program, provide commercial
    manufacturing capacity, enroll and monitor clinical trials,
    obtain regulatory approval, particularly outside the United
    States, and provide sales and marketing support. While we cannot
    assure you that the VEGF Trap will ever be successfully
    developed and commercialized, if sanofi-aventis does not perform
    its obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to
    develop, manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap in cancer
    indications will be significantly adversely affected.
    Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate its collaboration
    agreement with us at any time upon twelve months advance notice.
    If sanofi-aventis were to terminate its collaboration agreement
    with us, we would not have the resources or skills to replace
    those of our partner, which could cause significant delays in
    the development

and/or

manufacture of the VEGF Trap and result in



substantial additional costs to us. We have no sales, marketing,
    or distribution capabilities and would have to develop or
    outsource these capabilities. Termination of the sanofi-aventis
    collaboration agreement would create substantial new and
    additional risks to the successful development of the VEGF Trap
    oncology program.

If our
    collaboration with Bayer HealthCare for the VEGF Trap-Eye is
    terminated, our business operations and our ability to develop,
    manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap-Eye in the time
    expected, or at all, would be harmed.

We will rely heavily on Bayer HealthCare to assist with the
    development of the VEGF Trap-Eye. Under our agreement with them,
    Bayer HealthCare is required to fund approximately half of the
    development expenses incurred by both companies in connection
    with the global VEGF Trap-Eye development program. If the VEGF
    Trap-Eye program continues, we will rely on Bayer HealthCare to
    assist with funding the VEGF Trap-Eye development program,
    providing assistance with the enrollment and monitoring of
    clinical trials conducted outside the United States, obtaining
    regulatory approval outside the United States, and providing
    sales, marketing and commercial support for the product outside
    the United States. In particular, Bayer HealthCare has
    responsibility for selling VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United
    States using its sales force. While we cannot assure you that
    the VEGF Trap-Eye will ever be successfully developed and
    commercialized, if Bayer HealthCare does not perform its
    obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to
    develop, manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap-Eye
    outside the United States will be significantly adversely
    affected. Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate its
    collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve
    months advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving
    rise to termination. If Bayer HealthCare were to terminate its
    collaboration agreement with us, we would not have the resources
    or skills to replace those of our partner, which could cause
    significant delays in the development

and/or

commercialization of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States
    and result in substantial additional costs to us. We have no
    sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities and would have to
    develop or outsource these capabilities outside the United
    States. Termination of the Bayer HealthCare collaboration
    agreement would create substantial new and additional risks to
    the successful development of the VEGF Trap-Eye development
    program.

Our
    collaborators and service providers may fail to perform
    adequately in their efforts to support the development,
    manufacture, and commercialization of our drug
    candidates.

We depend upon third-party collaborators, including
    sanofi-aventis, Bayer HealthCare, and service providers such as
    clinical research organizations, outside testing laboratories,
    clinical investigator sites, and third-party manufacturers and
    product packagers and labelers, to assist us in the development
    of our product candidates. If any of our existing collaborators
    or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with
    us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services
    under an agreement in a timely manner or at all, we could
    experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the
    development or commercialization of our product candidates.

Risks
    Related to the Manufacture of Our Product Candidates

We
    have limited manufacturing capacity, which could inhibit our
    ability to successfully develop or commercialize our
    drugs.

Our manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce
    sufficient quantities of product for commercial sale. We intend
    to rely on our corporate collaborators, as well as contract
    manufacturers, to produce the large quantities of drug material
    needed for commercialization of our products. We rely entirely
    on third-party manufacturers for filling and finishing services.
    We will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver
    material on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory
    requirements. If we are unable to supply sufficient material on
    acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or
    difficulties in our relationships with our corporate
    collaborators or contract manufacturers, our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.

We may expand our own manufacturing capacity to support
    commercial production of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or
    API, for our product candidates. This will require substantial
    additional funds, and we will need to hire and train significant
    numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our
    facility.

Start-up

costs can be



large and

scale-up

entails significant risks related to process development and
    manufacturing yields. We may be unable to develop manufacturing
    facilities that are sufficient to produce drug material for
    clinical trials or commercial use. In addition, we may be unable
    to secure adequate filling and finishing services to support our
    products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations may be materially harmed.

We may be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for
    the manufacture of our product candidates. In addition, we may
    face difficulties in developing or acquiring production
    technology and managerial personnel to manufacture sufficient
    quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in
    compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental
    regulations and governmental permitting requirements.

If any
    of our clinical programs are discontinued, we may face costs
    related to the unused capacity at our manufacturing
    facilities.

We have large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New
    York. We use our facilities to produce bulk product for clinical
    and preclinical candidates for ourselves and our collaborations.
    If our clinical candidates are discontinued, we will have to
    absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and
    inefficiencies.

Certain
    of our raw materials are single-sourced from third parties;
    third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability
    to supply our products.

Certain raw materials necessary for manufacturing and
    formulation of our product candidates are provided by
    single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. We would be
    unable to obtain these raw materials for an indeterminate period
    of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to
    cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these
    materials or products to us for any reason, including due to
    regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial
    developments at or affecting the supplier, or due to labor
    shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product
    candidates for use in clinical trials, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and future prospects.

Also, certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture
    and the formulation of our clinical candidates may be derived
    from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine
    serum, and human serum albumin. There are certain European
    regulatory restrictions on using these biological source
    materials. If we are required to substitute for these sources to
    comply with European regulatory requirements, our clinical
    development activities may be delayed or interrupted.

Risks
    Related to Commercialization of Products

If we
    are unable to establish sales, marketing, and distribution
    capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to do
    so, we will be unable to successfully market and sell future
    products.

We have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities and
    have only a small staff with marketing capabilities. If we are
    unable to obtain those capabilities, either by developing our
    own organizations or entering into agreements with service
    providers, we will not be able to successfully sell any products
    that we may obtain regulatory approval for and bring to market
    in the future. In that event, we will not be able to generate
    significant revenue, even if our product candidates are
    approved. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the
    qualified sales and marketing personnel we need or that we will
    be able to enter into marketing or distribution agreements with
    third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all. Under the
    terms of our collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, we
    currently rely on sanofi-aventis for sales, marketing, and
    distribution of the VEGF Trap in cancer indications, should it
    be approved in the future by regulatory authorities for
    marketing. We will have to rely on a third party or devote
    significant resources to develop our own sales, marketing, and
    distribution capabilities for our other product candidates,
    including the VEGF Trap-Eye in the United States, and we may be
    unsuccessful in developing our own sales, marketing, and
    distribution organization.



Even
    if our product candidates are approved for marketing, their
    commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors
    have received approval for products with the same mechanism of
    action, and competitors may get to the marketplace before we do
    with better or lower cost drugs or the market for our product
    candidates may be too small to support commercialization or
    sufficient profitability.

We face substantial competition from pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology, and chemical companies. Many of our competitors
    have substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical
    product development and manufacturing capabilities, and
    financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. Our
    smaller competitors may also enhance their competitive position
    if they acquire or discover patentable inventions, form
    collaborative arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical
    companies. Even if we achieve product commercialization, our
    competitors have achieved, and may continue to achieve, product
    commercialization before our products are approved for marketing
    and sale.

Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
    Avastin

®

(Genentech), on the market for treating certain cancers and a
    number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working
    to develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, OSI
    Pharmaceuticals, and Pfizer. Many of these molecules are further
    along in development than the VEGF Trap and may offer
    competitive advantages over our molecule. Novartis has an
    ongoing Phase 3 clinical development program evaluating an
    orally delivered VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor in different
    cancer settings. Each of Pfizer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals
    (together with its partner Bayer) has received approval from the
    FDA to market and sell an oral medication that targets tumor
    cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth
    of tumors. The marketing approvals for Genentech’s VEGF
    antagonist, Avastin, and their extensive, ongoing clinical
    development plan for Avastin in other cancer indications, may
    make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical
    trials to support the VEGF Trap and to obtain regulatory
    approval of the VEGF Trap in these cancer settings. This may
    delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap. In addition, even if the VEGF Trap
    is ever approved for sale for the treatment of certain cancers,
    it will be difficult for our drug to compete against Avastin and
    the FDA approved kinase inhibitors, because doctors and patients
    will have significant experience using these medicines. In
    addition, an oral medication may be considerably less expensive
    for patients than a biologic medication, providing a competitive
    advantage to companies that market such products.

The market for eye disease products is also very competitive.
    Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the
    commercialization and further development of a VEGF antibody
    fragment
    (Lucentis

®

)
    for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD)
    and other eye indications that was approved by the FDA in June
    2006. OSI Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer are marketing an approved
    VEGF inhibitor
    (Macugen

®

)
    for wet AMD. Many other companies are working on the development
    of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet AMD
    that act by blocking VEGF, VEGF receptors, and through the use
    of soluble ribonucleic acids (sRNAs) that modulate gene
    expression. In addition, ophthalmologists are using off-label a
    third-party reformulated version of Genentech’s approved
    VEGF antagonist, Avastin, with success for the treatment of wet
    AMD. The National Eye Institute recently has received funding
    for a Phase 3 trial to compare Lucentis to Avastin in the
    treatment of wet AMD. The marketing approval of Macugen and
    Lucentis and the potential off-label use of Avastin make it more
    difficult for us to enroll patients in our clinical trials and
    successfully develop the VEGF Trap-Eye. Even if the VEGF
    Trap-Eye is ever approved for sale for the treatment of eye
    diseases, it may be difficult for our drug to compete against
    Lucentis or Macugen, because doctors and patients will have
    significant experience using these medicines. Moreover, the
    relatively low cost of therapy with Avastin in patients with wet
    AMD presents a further competitive challenge in this indication.

The availability of highly effective FDA approved
    TNF-antagonists such as
    Enbrel

®

(Amgen),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott Laboratories), and the IL-1 receptor antagonist
    Kineret

®

(Amgen), and other marketed therapies, makes it more difficult
    to successfully develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap. This is
    one of the reasons we discontinued the development of the IL-1
    Trap in adult rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, even if the
    IL-1 Trap is ever approved for sale, it will be difficult for
    our drug to compete against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists
    in indications where both are useful because doctors and
    patients will have significant experience using these effective
    medicines. Moreover, in such indications these approved
    therapeutics may offer competitive advantages over the IL-1
    Trap, such as requiring fewer injections.



There are both small molecules and antibodies in development by
    third parties that are designed to block the synthesis of
    interleukin-1 or inhibit the signaling of interleukin-1. For
    example, Eli Lilly and Company and Novartis are each developing
    antibodies to interleukin-1 and Amgen is developing an antibody
    to the interleukin-1 receptor. These drug candidates could offer
    competitive advantages over the IL-1 Trap. The successful
    development of these competing molecules could delay or impair
    our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the IL-1
    Trap. For example, we may find it difficult to enroll patients
    in clinical trials for the IL-1 Trap if the companies developing
    these competing interleukin-1 inhibitors commence clinical
    trials in the same indications.

We are developing the IL-1 Trap for the treatment of a spectrum
    of rare diseases associated with mutations in the

CIAS

    gene. These rare genetic disorders affect a small group of
    people, estimated to be between several hundred and a few
    thousand. There may be too few patients with these genetic
    disorders to profitably commercialize the IL-1 Trap in this
    indication.

The
    successful commercialization of our product candidates will
    depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these
    products from third-party payers and these payers may not agree
    to cover or reimburse for use of our
    products.

Our products, if commercialized, may be significantly more
    expensive than traditional drug treatments. Our future revenues
    and profitability will be adversely affected if United States
    and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and
    payers, and other third-party payers, including Medicare and
    Medicaid, do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our
    products to the patients. If these entities refuse to provide
    coverage and reimbursement with respect to our products or
    provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our
    products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and
    physicians may not prescribe them. Many third-party payers cover
    only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such
    payer more expensive for patients, and require prior
    authorization or failure on another type of treatment before
    covering a particular drug. Payers may especially impose these
    obstacles to coverage on higher-priced drugs, as our product
    candidates are likely to be.

We intend to file an application with the FDA seeking approval
    to market the IL-1 Trap for the treatment of a spectrum of rare
    genetic disorders called CAPS. There may be too few patients
    with CAPS to profitably commercialize the IL-1 Trap. Physicians
    may not prescribe the IL-1 Trap and CAPS patients may not be
    able to afford the IL-1 Trap if third party payers do not agree
    to reimburse the cost of IL-1 Trap therapy and this would
    adversely affect our ability to commercialize the IL-1 Trap
    profitably.

In addition to potential restrictions on coverage, the amount of
    reimbursement for our products may also reduce our
    profitability. In the United States, there have been, and we
    expect will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and
    reduce healthcare costs. Government and other third-party payers
    are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and
    increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage
    and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs.

Since our products, including the IL-1 Trap, will likely be too
    expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance
    coverage, if our products are unable to obtain adequate coverage
    and reimbursement by third-party payers our ability to
    successfully commercialize our product candidates may be
    adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of our products or
    any decrease in the price of our products will have a material
    adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability.

In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage and level of
    reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental
    control, and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing,
    and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some
    foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be
    approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements
    governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For
    example, the European Union provides options for its member
    states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which
    their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement
    and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A
    member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal
    product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect
    controls on the profitability of the company placing the
    medicinal product on the market. Our results of operations may
    suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign
    countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in
    foreign countries is limited.



Risk
    Related to Employees

We are
    dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and
    retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and
    commercial organizations, our business will be
    harmed.

We are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers. If
    we are not able to retain any of these persons or our Chairman,
    our business may suffer. In particular, we depend on the
    services of P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., the Chairman of our board
    of directors, Leonard Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our
    President and Chief Executive Officer, George D.
    Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice
    President, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron
    Research Laboratories, and Neil Stahl, Ph.D., our Senior
    Vice President, Research and Development Sciences. There is
    intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified
    scientists and managerial personnel in the development,
    manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We may not be able
    to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel
    necessary for developing our business.

Risks
    Related to Our Common Stock

Our
    stock price is extremely volatile.

There has been significant volatility in our stock price and
    generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies’
    securities. Various factors and events may have a significant
    impact on the market price of our common stock. These factors
    include, by way of example:

•

progress, delays, or adverse results in clinical trials;

•

announcement of technological innovations or product candidates
    by us or competitors;

•

fluctuations in our operating results;

•

public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of our product
    candidates;

•

developments in our relationship with collaborative partners;

•

developments in the biotechnology industry or in government
    regulation of healthcare;

•

large sales of our common stock by our executive officers,
    directors, or significant shareholders;

•

arrivals and departures of key personnel; and

•

general market conditions.

The trading price of our common stock has been, and could
    continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to
    these and other factors, including the sale or attempted sale of
    a large amount of our common stock in the market. Broad market
    fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our
    common stock.

In
    future years, if we or our independent registered public
    accounting firm are unable to conclude that our internal control
    over financial reporting is effective, the market value of our
    common stock could be adversely affected.

As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to
    include a report of management on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting in their annual reports on

Form 10-K

that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness
    of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition,
    the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our
    financial statements must attest to and report on
    management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting. Our independent
    registered public accounting firm provided us with an
    unqualified report as to our assessment and the effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, which report is included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

However, we cannot assure you that management or our independent
    registered public accounting firm will be able to provide such
    an assessment or unqualified report as of future year-ends. In
    this event, investors could lose confidence in the reliability
    of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in
    the market value of our common stock.



Future
    sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us
    may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise
    funds in new share offerings.

A small number of our shareholders beneficially own a
    substantial amount of our common stock. As of December 31,
    2006, our seven largest shareholders, including sanofi-aventis,
    beneficially owned 41.1% of our outstanding shares of Common
    Stock, assuming, in the case of Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D.
    Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, and P. Roy Vagelos, M.D.,
    our Chairman, the conversion of their Class A Stock into
    Common Stock and the exercise of all options held by them which
    are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2006.
    As of December 31, 2006, sanofi-aventis owned
    2,799,552 shares of Common Stock, representing 4.4% of the
    shares of Common Stock then outstanding. Under our stock
    purchase agreement with sanofi-aventis, sanofi-aventis may sell
    no more than 500,000 of these shares in any calendar quarter. If
    sanofi-aventis, or our other significant shareholders or we,
    sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public
    market, or the perception that such sales may occur exists, the
    market price of our Common Stock could fall. Sales of Common
    Stock by our significant shareholders, including sanofi-aventis,
    also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by
    selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a
    time and price that we deem appropriate.

Our
    existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence
    over matters requiring shareholder approval.

Holders of Class A Stock, who are generally the
    shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our
    initial public offering, are entitled to ten votes per share,
    while holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per
    share. As of December 31, 2006, holders of Class A
    Stock held 26.5% of the combined voting power of all of Common
    Stock and Class A Stock then outstanding. These
    shareholders, if acting together, would be in a position to
    significantly influence the election of our directors and to
    effect or prevent certain corporate transactions that require
    majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes,
    including mergers and other business combinations. This may
    result in our company taking corporate actions that you may not
    consider to be in your best interest and may affect the price of
    our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2006:

•

our current officers and directors beneficially owned 13.3% of
    our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming conversion of
    their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of
    all options held by such persons which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2006, and 30.5% of the
    combined voting power of our outstanding shares of Common Stock
    and Class A Stock, assuming the exercise of all options
    held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days
    of December 31, 2006; and

•

our seven largest shareholders beneficially owned 41.1% of our
    outstanding shares of Common Stock assuming, in the case of
    Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Executive
    Officer, and P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., our Chairman, the conversion
    of their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise
    of all options held by them which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2006. In addition, these seven
    shareholders held 48.7% of the combined voting power of our
    outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock,
    assuming the exercise of all options held by our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chairman which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2006.

The
    anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and
    of New York corporate law, could deter, delay, or prevent an
    acquisition or other “change in control” of us and
    could adversely affect the price of our common
    stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our
    by-laws and the New York Business Corporation Law contain
    various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or
    preventing a change in control of our company or our management
    that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. Some of
    these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it
    more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors
    and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also
    limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the
    future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:

•

authorization to issue “blank check” preferred stock,
    which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the
    board of directors without prior shareholder approval, with
    rights senior to those of our common shareholders;



•

a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three
    successive annual meetings to replace all of our directors;

•

a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for
    cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty
    percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for
    directors, as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the
    board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors;

•

any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of
    shareholders may be taken without a meeting, only if, prior to
    such action, all of our shareholders consent, the effect of
    which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at
    a duly convened meeting;

•

any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual
    meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this
    intention in writing and meet various other
    requirements; and

•

under the New York Business Corporation Law, a plan of merger or
    consolidation of the Company must be approved by two-thirds of
    the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.
    See the risk factor immediately above captioned

“Our
    existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence
    over matters requiring shareholder approval.”

In addition, we have a Change in Control Severance Plan and our
    chief executive officer has an employment agreement that
    provides severance benefits in the event our officers are
    terminated as a result of a change in control of the Company.
    Many of our stock options issued under our 2000 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan may become fully vested in connection with a
    “change in control” of our company, as defined in the
    plan.

Properties

We conduct our research, development, manufacturing, and
    administrative activities at our owned and leased facilities. We
    currently lease approximately 236,000 square feet of
    laboratory and office space in Tarrytown, New York.

In December 2006, we entered into a new operating lease
    agreement for approximately 221,000 square feet of
    laboratory and office space at our current Tarrytown location.
    The new lease includes approximately 27,000 square feet
    that we currently occupy (our retained facilities) and
    approximately 194,000 square feet to be located in new
    facilities that will be constructed and which are expected to be
    completed in early-2009. The term of the lease is expected to
    commence in early-2008 and will expire approximately
    16 years later. Under the new lease we also have various
    options and rights on additional space at the Tarrytown site,
    and will continue to lease our present facilities until the new
    facilities are ready for occupancy. In addition, the lease
    contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease
    by five years each and early termination options for our
    retained facilities only. The lease provides for monthly
    payments over the term of the lease related to our retained
    facilities, the costs of construction and tenant improvements
    for our new facilities, and additional charges for utilities,
    taxes, and operating expenses.

We own a facility in Rensselaer, New York, consisting of two
    buildings totaling approximately 123,500 square feet of
    research, manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. We also
    lease an additional 75,000 square feet of manufacturing,
    office, and warehouse space in Rensselaer.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and
    intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the
    treatment of serious medical conditions. We are currently
    focused on three development programs: IL-1 Trap (rilonacept) in
    various inflammatory indications, the VEGF Trap in oncology, and
    the VEGF Trap-Eye formulation in eye diseases using intraocular
    delivery. The VEGF Trap is being developed in oncology in
    collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group. In October 2006, we
    entered into collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC for the
    development of the VEGF Trap-Eye. Our preclinical research
    programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis,
    ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases
    and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and
    cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases. We expect that our
    next generation of product candidates will be based on our
    proprietary technologies for developing human monoclonal
    antibodies.

Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant
    risk and expense. Since inception we have not generated any
    sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
    product candidates and we may never receive such revenues.
    Before revenues from the commercialization of our product
    candidates can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must
    overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully
    completing research and development and obtaining regulatory
    approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other
    countries. In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
    industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new
    developments may render our products and technologies
    uncompetitive or obsolete.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
    2006, we had a cumulative loss of $687.6 million. In the
    absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product
    candidates or other sources, the amount, timing, nature, and
    source of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue as
    we conduct our research and development activities. We expect to
    incur substantial losses over the next several years as we
    continue the clinical development of the VEGF Trap-Eye and IL-1
    Trap; advance new product candidates into clinical development
    from our existing research programs utilizing our new technology
    for designing fully human monoclonal antibodies; continue our
    research and development programs; and commercialize product
    candidates that receive regulatory approval, if any. Also, our
    activities may expand over time and require additional
    resources, and we expect our operating losses to be substantial
    over at least the next several years. Our losses may fluctuate
    from quarter to quarter and will depend, among other factors, on
    the progress of our research and development efforts, the timing
    of certain expenses, and the amount and timing of payments that
    we receive from collaborators.

As a company that does not expect to be profitable over the next
    several years, management of cash flow is extremely important.
    The most significant use of our cash is for research and
    development activities, which include drug discovery,
    preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the manufacture of
    drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials. In
    2006, our research and development expenses totaled
    $137.1 million. We expect these expenses to increase
    substantially in 2007 as we begin Phase 3 clinical trials
    of the VEGF Trap-Eye, expand our IL-1 Trap clinical program,
    advance our antibody development program, and increase our
    research and development headcount. The principal sources of
    cash to-date have been sales of common equity and convertible
    debt and funding from our collaborators in the form of up-front
    payments, research progress payments, and payments for our
    research and development activities.



A primary driver of our expenses is our number of full-time
    employees. Our annual average headcount in 2006 was 573 compared
    with 696 in 2005 and 721 in 2004. In 2006, our average annual
    headcount decreased primarily as a result of reductions made in
    the fourth quarter of 2005 and mid-year in 2006. These workforce
    reductions were associated with narrowing the focus of our
    research and development efforts, substantial improvements in
    manufacturing productivity, the June 2005 expiration of our
    collaboration with Procter & Gamble, and the completion
    of contract manufacturing for Merck in October 2006. In 2007, we
    expect our annual average headcount to increase to approximately
    650 due, in part, to our expanded development programs for the
    VEGF Trap-Eye and IL-1 Trap, and our plans to move two new
    antibody candidates into clinical trials every year beginning
    around the end of 2007.

The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs
    are significant factors that can affect our operating and
    financial results. In our clinical programs, key events in 2006
    and plans for 2007 are as follows:

Collaborations

Our current collaboration agreements with sanofi-aventis, Bayer,
    and Novartis Pharma AG, and our expired agreement with The
    Procter & Gamble Company are summarized below.

The
    sanofi-aventis Group

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
    with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (now a member of the
    sanofi-aventis Group) to collaborate on the development and
    commercialization of the VEGF Trap in all countries other than
    Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap. Sanofi-aventis made a
    non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and
    purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our
    Common Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration
    agreement to exclude rights to develop and commercialize the
    VEGF Trap for intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection
    with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a $25.0 million
    non-refundable payment to us.

In December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our
    collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the
    companies are collaborating on the development of the VEGF Trap
    to include Japan. In connection with this amendment,
    sanofi-aventis agreed to make a $25.0 million
    non-refundable up-front payment to us, which was received in
    January 2006. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we
    and sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
    sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap outside of Japan, for disease
    indications included in our collaboration. We are entitled to a
    royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of the VEGF Trap in
    Japan, subject to certain potential adjustments. We may also
    receive up to $400.0 million in milestone payments upon
    receipt of specified marketing approvals. This total includes up
    to $360.0 million in milestone payments related to the
    receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF Trap
    oncology and other indications in the United States or the
    European Union. Another $40.0 million of milestone payments
    relate to receipt of marketing approvals for up to five VEGF
    Trap oncology indications in Japan. In December 2004, we earned
    a $25.0 million payment from sanofi-aventis, which was
    received in January 2005, upon the achievement of an early-stage
    clinical milestone.

Regeneron has agreed to manufacture clinical supplies of the
    VEGF Trap at our plant in Rensselaer, New York. Sanofi-aventis
    has agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale
    manufacturing capacity for the VEGF Trap.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon
    worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during
    the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If
    the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses,
    including 50% of the $25.0 million payment received in
    connection with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration
    agreement, in accordance with a formula based on the amount of
    development expenses and our share of the



collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate
    at our option. Since inception of the collaboration through
    December 31, 2006, we and sanofi-aventis have incurred
    $205.0 million in agreed upon development expenses related
    to VEGF Trap program. In addition, if the first commercial sale
    of a VEGF Trap product for intraocular delivery to the eye
    predates the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product under
    the collaboration by two years, we will begin reimbursing
    sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of VEGF Trap
    development expenses in accordance with a formula until the
    first commercial VEGF Trap sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap
    development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
    rights to the VEGF Trap.

Bayer
    Healthcare LLC

In October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration
    agreement with Bayer to globally develop, and commercialize
    outside the United States, the VEGF Trap-Eye. Under the terms of
    the agreement, Bayer made a non-refundable up-front payment to
    us of $75.0 million. In addition, we are eligible to
    receive up to $110.0 million in development and regulatory
    milestones, including a total of $40.0 million upon the
    initiation of Phase 3 trials in defined major indications
    such as wet AMD and DME. We are also eligible to receive up to
    an additional $135.0 million in sales milestones when and
    if total annual sales of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United
    States achieve certain specified levels starting at
    $200.0 million.

We will share equally with Bayer in any future profits arising
    from the commercialization of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the
    United States. If the VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing
    authorization in a major market country outside the United
    States and the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be
    obligated to reimburse Bayer out of our share of the
    collaboration profits for 50% of the agreed upon development
    expenses that Bayer has incurred in accordance with a formula
    based on the amount of development expenses that Bayer has
    incurred and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a
    faster rate at our option. Within the United States, we are
    responsible for any future commercialization of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye and have retained exclusive rights to any future
    profits arising therefrom.

Agreed upon development expenses incurred by both companies,
    beginning in 2007, under a global development plan will be
    shared as follows:

2007:

Up to $50.0 million shared equally; we are solely
    responsible for up to the next $40.0 million; over
    $90.0 million shared equally.

2008:

Up to $70.0 million shared equally, we are solely
    responsible for up to the next $30.0 million; over
    $100.0 million shared equally.

2009 and thereafter:

All expenses shared equally.

Neither party will be reimbursed for any development expenses
    that it incurred prior to 2007.

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
    supply clinical and commercial product requirements.

Bayer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause
    with at least six months or twelve months advance notice
    depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination.
    In the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, we
    retain all rights to the VEGF Trap-Eye.

Novartis
    Pharma AG

In March 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap.
    Novartis made a non-refundable payment to us of
    $27.0 million.

IL-1 Trap development expenses incurred in 2003 were shared
    equally by Regeneron and Novartis. We funded our share of 2003
    development expenses through loans from Novartis. In March 2004,
    Novartis forgave its outstanding loans to us totaling
    $17.8 million, including accrued interest, based on
    Regeneron’s achieving a pre-defined development milestone,
    which was recognized as a research progress payment.



In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not
    to proceed with the joint development of the

IL-1

Trap,
    and subsequently paid us $42.75 million to satisfy its
    obligation to fund development costs for the nine month period
    following its notification and for the two months prior to that
    notice. All rights to the IL-1 Trap have reverted to Regeneron.
    In addition, we recognized contract research and development
    revenue of $22.1 million, which represents the remaining
    amount of the March 2003 up-front payment from Novartis that had
    previously been deferred.

Under the collaboration agreement, we retain the right to elect
    to collaborate in the future development and commercialization
    of a Novartis IL-1 antibody, which is in clinical development.
    Following completion of Phase 2 development and submission
    to us of a written report on the Novartis IL-1 antibody, we have
    the right, in consideration for an opt-in payment, to elect to
    co-develop and co-commercialize the Novartis IL-1 antibody in
    North America. If we elect to exercise this right, we are
    responsible for paying 45% of post-election North American
    development costs for the antibody product. In return, we are
    entitled to co-promote the Novartis IL-1 antibody and to receive
    45% of net profits on sales of the antibody product in North
    America. Under certain circumstances, we are also entitled to
    receive royalties on sales of the Novartis IL-1 antibody in
    Europe.

In addition, under the collaboration agreement, Novartis has the
    right to elect to collaborate in the development and
    commercialization of a second generation IL-1 Trap following
    completion of its Phase 2 development, should we decide to
    clinically develop such a second generation product candidate.
    Novartis does not have any rights or options with respect to our
    IL-1 Trap currently in clinical development.

The
    Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, we entered into a long-term collaboration with
    Procter & Gamble to discover, develop, and
    commercialize pharmaceutical products, and Procter &
    Gamble agreed to provide funding in support of our research
    efforts related to the collaboration. Effective
    December 31, 2000, in accordance with the companies’
    collaboration agreement, Procter & Gamble was obligated
    to fund our research on therapeutic areas that were of
    particular interest to Procter & Gamble through
    December 2005, with no further research obligations by either
    party thereafter. Under the collaboration agreement, research
    support from Procter & Gamble was $2.5 million per
    quarter, plus annual adjustments for inflation, through December
    2005.

In June 2005, we and Procter & Gamble amended our
    collaboration agreement. Under the terms of the modified
    agreement, the two companies agreed that the research activities
    being pursued under the collaboration agreement were completed
    on June 30, 2005, six months prior to the December 31,
    2005 expiration date in the collaboration agreement.
    Procter & Gamble agreed to make a one-time
    $5.6 million payment to Regeneron, which was received in
    July 2005, and to fund our research under the agreement through
    the second quarter of 2005. We agreed to pay Procter &
    Gamble approximately $1.0 million to acquire certain
    capital equipment owned by Procter & Gamble and located
    at our facilities. We and Procter & Gamble divided
    rights to research programs and preclinical product candidates
    that were developed during the research term of the
    collaboration. Neither party has the right to participate in the
    development or commercialization of the other party’s
    product candidates. We are entitled to receive royalties based
    on any future product sales of a Procter & Gamble
    preclinical candidate arising from the collaboration, and
    Procter & Gamble is entitled to receive a small royalty
    on any sales of a single Regeneron candidate that is not
    currently being developed. Neither party is entitled to receive
    either royalties or other payments based on any other products
    arising from the collaboration.

Other
    Agreements

AstraZeneca

In February 2007, we entered into a non-exclusive license
    agreement with AstraZeneca that will allow AstraZeneca to
    utilize our
    VelocImmune

®

technology in its internal research programs to discover
    human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement,
    AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million non-refundable up-front
    payment to us. AstraZeneca also will make up to five additional
    annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to its ability to
    terminate the agreement after making the first three additional
    payments or earlier if the technology does not meet minimum
    performance criteria. We are entitled to receive a
    mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
    products discovered by AstraZeneca using our VelocImmune
    technology.



National
    Institutes of Health

In September 2006, we were awarded a five-year grant from the
    National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the NIH’s
    Knockout Mouse Project. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Project
    is to build a comprehensive and broadly available resource of
    knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function
    and human diseases. We will use our
    VelociGene

®

technology to take aim at 3,500 of the most difficult genes to
    target and which are not currently the focus of other
    large-scale knockout mouse programs. We have also agreed to
    grant a limited license to a consortium of research
    institutions, the other major participants in the Knockout Mouse
    Project, to use components of our VelociGene technology in the
    Knockout Mouse Project. We will generate a collection of
    targeting vectors and targeted mouse embryonic stem cells
    (ES cells) which can be used to produce knockout mice.
    These materials will be made widely available to academic
    researchers without charge. We will receive a fee for each
    targeted ES cell line or targeting construct made by us or the
    research consortium and transferred to commercial entities.

Under the NIH grant, we will be entitled to receive a minimum of
    $17.9 million over a five-year period. We will receive
    another $1.0 million to optimize our existing C57BL/6 ES
    cell line and its proprietary growth medium, both of which will
    be supplied to the research consortium for its use in the
    Knockout Mouse Project. We will have the right to use, for any
    purpose, all materials generated by us and the research
    consortium.

Accounting
    for Stock-based Employee Compensation

Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value based
    method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. (SFAS) 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
    using the modified prospective method as described in
    SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.

As a
    result, in 2005, we recognized compensation expense, in an
    amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments
    (including stock option awards) on their date of grant, over the
    vesting period of the awards using graded vesting, which is an
    accelerated expense recognition method. Under the modified
    prospective method, compensation expense for Regeneron is
    recognized for (a) all share based payments granted on or
    after January 1, 2005 and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date. Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, we
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. (APB) 25,

Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations.
    Therefore, compensation expense related to employee stock
    options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period
    prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior period operating
    results have not been restated.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which is a revision
    of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting
    for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
    share-based payment transactions, and requires the recognition
    of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of
    the share-based payment (including stock options and restricted
    stock) issued to employees. SFAS 123R requires companies to
    estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited
    at the time of grant and to revise this estimate, if necessary,
    in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Effective January 1, 2005, and prior to our
    adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized the effect of
    forfeitures in stock-based compensation cost in the period when
    they occurred, in accordance with SFAS 123. Upon adoption
    of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, we were
    required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the
    effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards
    that are not expected to vest as of the SFAS 123R adoption
    date. This adjustment reduced our loss by $0.8 million and
    is included in our operating results for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as a cumulative-effect adjustment of a
    change in accounting principle. Exclusive of the
    cumulative-effect adjustment, the effect of the change from
    applying the provisions of SFAS 123 to applying the
    provisions of SFAS 123R on our loss from operations, net
    loss, and net loss per share for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was not significant, and there was no
    impact to our cash flows for the year ended December 31,
    2006.

Non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense related to
    stock option awards (Stock Option Expense) recognized in
    operating expenses totaled $18.4 million and
    $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. In addition, for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, $0.1 million of Stock Option
    Expense



was capitalized into inventory. As of December 31, 2006,
    there was $44.0 million of stock-based compensation cost
    related to outstanding nonvested stock options, net of estimated
    forfeitures, which had not yet been recognized in operating
    expenses. We expect to recognize this compensation cost over a
    weighted-average period of 1.9 years. In addition, there
    are 723,092 options which are unvested as of December 31,
    2006 and would become vested upon our products achieving certain
    sales targets and the optionee satisfying certain service
    conditions. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant
    date, related to these performance options totals
    $2.7 million and will begin to be recognized only if, and
    when, these options’ performance condition is considered to
    be probable of attainment.

Assumptions

We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
    each option granted under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Using this model, fair value is
    calculated based on assumptions with respect to
    (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of our board of directors are expected to hold their options
    prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend
    yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
    rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
    securities with maturities approximating the options’
    expected lives. Expected volatility has been estimated based on
    actual movements in our stock price over the most recent
    historical periods equivalent to the options’ expected
    lives. Expected lives are principally based on our limited
    historical exercise experience with option grants with similar
    exercise prices. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have
    never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any
    in the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes the
    weighted average values of the assumptions we used in computing
    the fair value of option grants during 2006, 2005 and 2004:




Expected volatility

Changes in any of these estimates may materially affect the fair

    compensation recognized in any period.

    partly of reimbursement for research and development expenses
    and partly of the recognition of revenue related to a total of
    $105.0 million of non-refundable, up-front payments
    received in 2003 and 2006. Non-refundable up-front payments are
    recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the

Sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron VEGF Trap
    expenses increased in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to
    higher costs related to our manufacture of VEGF Trap clinical
    supplies during the first half of 2006. Recognition of deferred
    revenue related to sanofi-aventis’ up-front payments also
    increased in 2006 from the same period in 2005, due to our
    receipt in January 2006 of a $25.0 million non-refundable,
    up-front payment from sanofi-aventis related to the expansion of
    the companies’ VEGF Trap collaboration to include Japan. As
    of December 31, 2006, $70.0 million of the original
    $105.0 million of up-front payments was deferred and will
    be recognized as revenue in future periods.

Contract research and development revenue earned from
    Procter & Gamble decreased in 2006 compared to 2005, as
    the research activities being pursued under our December 2000
    collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble, as
    amended, were completed on June 30, 2005, as described
    above under “Collaborations — The
    Procter & Gamble Company.” Since the second
    quarter of 2005, we have not received, and do not expect to
    receive, any further contract research and development revenue
    from Procter & Gamble.

As described above, in October 2006 we entered into a VEGF
    Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer. We will recognize revenue
    from Bayer, in connection with the companies’
    collaboration, in accordance with SAB 104 and EITF

00-21.

When
    we and Bayer have formalized our projected global development
    plans for the VEGF Trap-Eye, as well as the projected
    responsibilities of each of the companies under those
    development plans, we will begin recognizing contract research
    and development revenue related to payments from Bayer. As a
    result, there was no contract research and development revenue
    earned from Bayer in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the
    $75.0 million up-front payment received from Bayer in
    October 2006 was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in
    future periods.

Other contract research and development revenue includes
    $0.5 million recognized in connection with our NIH Grant,
    as described above.

Contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long-term
    agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., which expired in
    October 2006, to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our
    Rensselaer, New York facility. Contract manufacturing revenue
    decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a decrease in product
    shipments to Merck in 2006. Revenue and the related
    manufacturing expense were recognized as product was shipped,
    after acceptance by Merck. Included in contract manufacturing
    revenue in 2006 and 2005 were $1.2 million and
    $1.4 million, respectively, of deferred revenue associated
    with capital improvement reimbursements paid by Merck prior to
    commencement of production. We do not expect to receive any
    further contract manufacturing revenue from Merck and there was
    no Merck deferred revenue as of the end of 2006.

Expenses:

Total operating expenses decreased to $171.1 million in
    2006 from $190.6 million in 2005 due, in part, to our lower
    headcount, as described above. (Also see “Severance
    Costs” below.)



Operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 include a total of
    $18.4 million and $19.9 million of Stock Option
    Expense, respectively, as detailed below:

Payroll and benefits decreased principally due to our lower
    headcount in 2006. In addition, payroll and benefits in 2006 and
    2005 included $0.4 million and $2.2 million,
    respectively, of severance costs associated with our



workforce reduction plan that we initiated in October 2005.
    Clinical trial expenses decreased primarily due to lower IL-1
    Trap costs in 2006 as we discontinued clinical development of
    the IL-1 Trap in adult rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis
    in the second half of 2005. This decrease was partly offset by
    higher 2006 VEGF Trap-Eye costs related to Phase 1 and
    Phase 2 clinical trials that we are conducting in wet AMD.
    Clinical manufacturing costs decreased because of lower costs in
    2006 related to manufacturing IL-1 Trap clinical supplies, which
    were partially offset by higher costs related to manufacturing
    VEGF Trap clinical supplies. Research and preclinical
    development costs decreased principally because of lower costs
    for general research supplies in 2006 as we narrowed the focus
    of our research and development efforts due, in part, to the
    expiration of our collaboration with Procter & Gamble
    in June 2005, as described above. Occupancy and other operating
    costs decreased primarily due to our lower 2006 headcount and
    lower costs for utilities associated with our leased research
    facilities in Tarrytown, New York.

Contract
    Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses decreased to $8.1 million
    in 2006, compared to $9.6 million in 2005, primarily
    because we shipped less product to Merck in 2006.

General
    and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $25.9 million in 2006 from $25.4 million in the same
    period of 2005 as higher legal expenses related to general
    corporate matters and higher patent-and trademark-related costs
    were partly offset by lower professional fees for internal audit
    and other administrative advisory services and lower
    administrative facility costs.

Other
    Income and Expense:

In June 2005, we and Procter & Gamble amended our
    collaboration agreement and agreed that the research activities
    of both companies under the collaboration agreement were
    completed. In connection with the amendment, Procter &
    Gamble made a one-time $5.6 million payment to us, which we
    recognized as other contract income in 2005. In January 2005, we
    and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to
    exclude rights to develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap for
    intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with the
    amendment, sanofi-aventis made a one-time $25.0 million
    payment to us, which we recognized as other contract income in
    2005.

Investment income increased to $16.5 million in 2006 from
    $10.4 million in 2005, due primarily to higher balances of
    cash and marketable securities (due, in part, to the up-front
    payment received from Bayer in October 2006, as described above,
    and the receipt of net proceeds from the November 2006 public
    offering of our Common Stock), as well as higher effective
    interest rates on investment securities in 2006. Interest
    expense was $12.0 million in 2006 and 2005. Interest
    expense is attributable primarily to $200.0 million of
    convertible notes issued in October 2001, which mature in 2008
    and bear interest at 5.5% per annum.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004

Net
    Income (Loss):

Regeneron reported a net loss of $95.4 million, or
    $1.71 per share (basic and diluted) for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, compared with net income of
    $41.7 million, or $0.75 per basic share and
    $0.74 per diluted share, for 2004. Our net loss in 2005
    included $19.9 million of Stock Option Expense due to our
    adoption of SFAS 123 effective January 1, 2005, as
    described above.

Our total revenue decreased to $66.2 million in 2005 from
    $174.0 million in 2004, due primarily to lower revenues
    related to our collaboration with sanofi-aventis on the VEGF
    Trap and the absence in the 2005 period of revenues related to
    our collaboration with Novartis on the IL-1 Trap which ended in
    2004. We recognize revenue from the sanofi-aventis and Novartis
    collaborations in accordance with SAB 104 and EITF

00-21

(see
    Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
    Estimates). Collaboration revenue earned from sanofi-aventis and
    Novartis is comprised of contract research and development
    revenue and research progress payments. Contract research and
    development revenue, as detailed below, consists partly of
    reimbursement for research and development expenses and partly
    of the recognition of revenue related to non-refundable,
    up-front payments. Non-refundable up-front payments are recorded
    as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period
    during which we are obligated to perform services.

Contract research & development revenues earned from

Sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron VEGF Trap
    expenses decreased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to
    lower clinical supply manufacturing costs in 2005. We
    manufactured clinical supplies of the VEGF Trap throughout 2004,
    but only manufactured VEGF Trap clinical supplies during the
    fourth quarter of 2005. In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis
    provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint
    development of the IL-1 Trap and the remaining balance of the
    $27.0 million up-front payment received from Novartis in
    March 2003 was



recognized as contract research and development revenue. Since
    the first quarter of 2004, we have not received, and do not
    expect to receive, any further contract research and development
    revenue from Novartis.

Contract research and development revenue earned from
    Procter & Gamble also decreased in 2005 compared to
    2004, resulting from the June 2005 amendment to our December
    2000 collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble.
    Under the terms of the modified agreement, Procter &
    Gamble funded Regeneron’s research for the first two
    quarters of 2005, compared with a full year of collaborative
    research funding in 2004. Since the second quarter of 2005, we
    have not received, and do not expect to receive, any further
    contract research and development revenue from
    Procter & Gamble.

In December 2004, we earned a $25.0 million research
    progress payment from sanofi-aventis, which was received in
    January 2005, upon achievement of an early-stage VEGF Trap
    clinical milestone. In March 2004, Novartis forgave all of its
    outstanding loans, including accrued interest, to Regeneron
    totaling $17.8 million, based upon Regeneron’s
    achieving a pre-defined IL-1 Trap development milestone. These
    amounts were recognized as research progress payments in 2004.

Contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long-term
    agreement with Merck, which expired in October 2006. Contract
    manufacturing revenue decreased to $13.7 million in 2005
    from $18.1 million in 2004, principally due to a decrease
    in product shipments to Merck in 2005 compared to 2004. Revenue
    and the related manufacturing expense were recognized as product
    was shipped, after acceptance by Merck. Included in contract
    manufacturing revenue in 2005 and 2004 were $1.4 million
    and $3.6 million, respectively, of deferred revenue
    associated with capital improvement reimbursements paid by Merck
    prior to commencement of production.

Expenses:

Total operating expenses increased to $190.6 million in
    2005 from $168.4 million in 2004. Operating expenses in
    2005 include a total of $19.9 million of Stock Option
    Expense, as follows:

In addition, $0.1 million of Stock Option Expense was
    capitalized into inventory, for a total of $20.0 million of
    Stock Option Expense recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2005. As described under “Accounting for
    Stock-based Employee Compensation” above, Stock Option
    Expense was not included in operating expenses in 2004, as
    reported in our Statement of Operations. In 2004, had we adopted
    the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
    employee compensation under the provisions of SFAS 123,
    Stock Option Expense would have totaled $33.6 million. The
    decrease in total Stock Option Expense of $13.6 million in
    2005 was partly due to lower exercise prices of annual employee
    option grants made by us in December 2004 in comparison to the
    exercise prices of annual grants in recent prior years. Exercise
    prices of these option grants were generally equal to the fair
    market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant. The
    decrease in Stock Option Expense in 2005 was also due, in part,
    to the exchange of options by eligible employees in connection
    with our stock option exchange program in January 2005, as the
    unamortized fair value of the surrendered options on the date of
    the exchange is being recognized as Stock Option Expense over a
    longer time period (the vesting period of the replacement
    options) in accordance with SFAS 123.



Research
    and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses increased to
    $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $136.1 million for 2004 due, in part, to the inclusion
    of $11.9 million of Stock Option Expense in 2005 research
    and development expenses, resulting from the adoption of
    SFAS 123, effective January 1, 2005. The following
    table summarizes the major categories of our research and
    development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005
    and 2004:

Payroll and benefits, exclusive of Stock Option Expense,
    increased $4.5 million in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to
    2005 wage and salary increases, higher employee benefit costs,
    and severance costs (totaling $2.2 million in
    2005) associated with our workforce reduction plan that we
    initiated in October 2005. Clinical trial expenses increased
    $7.9 million in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to higher IL-1
    Trap costs associated with commencing clinical studies in new
    indications and discontinuing the Phase 2b study in adult
    rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical manufacturing costs, exclusive of
    Stock Option Expense, decreased $2.6 million in 2005 from
    2004, as lower costs in 2005 related to manufacturing clinical
    supplies of the VEGF Trap and the IL-4/13 Trap were partly
    offset by higher costs related to manufacturing clinical
    supplies of the IL-1 Trap. Research and preclinical development
    costs decreased $3.0 million in 2005 from 2004 due
    primarily to lower VEGF Trap preclinical development costs and
    lower costs for general research supplies in 2005. Occupancy and
    other operating costs increased $0.8 million in 2005 from
    2004, due primarily to higher costs for utilities, taxes, and
    operating expenses associated with our leased research
    facilities in Tarrytown, New York.

Contract
    Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses decreased to $9.6 million
    in 2005, compared to $15.2 million in 2004, primarily
    because we shipped less product to Merck in 2005 and we incurred
    unfavorable manufacturing costs in 2004, which were expensed in
    the period incurred.

General
    and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $25.4 million in 2005 from $17.1 million in 2004, due
    primarily to the inclusion of $7.6 million of Stock Option
    Expense in 2005 general and administrative expenses,



resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123, effective
    January 1, 2005. In addition, in 2005 administrative wage
    and salary increases, higher employee benefits costs and higher
    administrative facility costs were partly offset by
    (i) lower legal expenses related to Company litigation and
    general corporate matters and (ii) lower professional fees,
    principally associated with accounting and other services
    related to our first year of compliance in 2004 with the
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002.

Other
    Income and Expense:

In June 2005, we and Procter & Gamble amended our
    collaboration agreement and agreed that the research activities
    of both companies under the collaboration agreement were
    completed. In connection with the amendment, Procter &
    Gamble made a one-time $5.6 million payment to us, which we
    recognized as other contract income in 2005. In January 2005, we
    and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to
    exclude rights to develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap for
    intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with the
    amendment, sanofi-aventis made a one-time $25.0 million
    payment to us, which we recognized as other contract income in
    2005. In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis notified us of its
    decision to forgo its right under the collaboration to jointly
    develop the IL-1 Trap and subsequently paid us
    $42.75 million to satisfy its obligation to fund
    development costs for the IL-1 Trap for the nine-month period
    following its notification and for the two months prior to that
    notice. The $42.75 million was included in other contract
    income in 2004.

Investment income increased to $10.4 million in 2005 from
    $5.5 million in 2004, due primarily to higher effective
    interest rates on investment securities in 2005. Interest
    expense decreased slightly to $12.0 million in 2005 from
    $12.2 million in 2004. Interest expense is attributable
    primarily to $200.0 million of convertible notes issued in
    October 2001, which mature in 2008 and bear interest at
    5.5% per annum.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our operations
    primarily through offerings of our equity securities, a private
    placement of convertible debt, revenue earned under our past and
    present research and development and contract manufacturing
    agreements, including our agreements with sanofi-aventis, Bayer,
    and Merck, and investment income.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005

At December 31, 2006, we had $522.9 million in cash,
    cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared with
    $316.7 million at December 31, 2005. In January 2006,
    we received a $25.0 million up-front payment from
    sanofi-aventis, which was receivable at December 31, 2005,
    in connection with an amendment to our collaboration agreement
    to include Japan. In October 2006, we received a
    $75.0 million up-front payment in connection with our new
    VEGF Trap-Eye license and collaboration agreement with Bayer. In
    November 2006, we completed a public offering of
    7.6 million shares of our Common Stock and received
    proceeds, after expenses, of $174.6 million.

Cash
    Provided by (Used in) Operations:

Net cash provided by operations was $23.1 million in 2006,
    compared to net cash used in operations of $30.3 million in
    2005. Our net losses of $102.3 million in 2006 and
    $95.4 million in 2005 included $18.7 million and
    $21.9 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based
    employee compensation costs, of which $18.4 million and
    $19.9 million, respectively, represented Stock Option
    Expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R in January
    2006 and SFAS 123 in January 2005. In 2006,

end-of-year

accounts receivable balances decreased by $29.0 million
    compared to 2005, due to the January 2006 receipt of the
    $25.0 million up-front payment from sanofi-aventis, as
    described above, and lower amounts due from sanofi aventis for
    reimbursement of VEGF Trap development expenses. Also, our
    deferred revenue balances increased by $60.8 million in
    2006 compared to 2005, due primarily to the October 2006
    $75.0 million up-front payment from Bayer, as described
    above, partly offset by 2006 revenue recognition of
    $11.4 million from deferred sanofi-aventis up-front
    payments. In 2005,

end-of-year

accounts receivable balances decreased by $6.6 million
    compared to 2004, due to lower amounts due from sanofi-aventis
    for reimbursement of VEGF Trap development expenses and the June
    2005 completion of funding for Regeneron research activities
    under our collaboration with Procter & Gamble. Also,
    our deferred revenue balances increased



by $14.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to
    the January 2006 $25.0 million up-front payment from
    sanofi-aventis, which was receivable at December 31, 2005,
    partly offset by 2005 revenue recognition of $9.5 million
    from deferred sanofi-aventis up-front payments. The majority of
    cash used in our operations in both 2006 and 2005 was to fund
    research and development, primarily related to our clinical
    programs.

In both 2006 and 2005, we made two semi-annual interest payments
    totaling $11.0 million per year on our convertible senior
    subordinated notes.

Cash
    Provided by Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities was $155.1 million in
    2006 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of
    $115.5 million in 2005, due primarily to an increase in
    purchases of marketable securities net of sales or maturities.
    In 2006, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or
    maturities by $150.7 million, whereas in 2005, sales or
    maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by
    $120.5 million.

Cash
    Provided by Financing Activities:

Cash provided by financing activities increased to
    $185.4 million in 2006 from $4.1 million in 2005 due
    primarily to our completed public offering of 7.6 million
    shares of Common Stock in November 2006, as described above. In
    addition, proceeds from issuances of Common Stock in connection
    with exercises of employee stock options increased from
    $4.1 million in 2005 to $10.4 million in 2006.

Collaboration
    with the sanofi-aventis Group:

Under our collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, as
    described under “Collaborations” above, agreed upon
    worldwide VEGF Trap development expenses incurred by both
    companies during the term of the agreement, including costs
    associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supply, will be
    funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes
    profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for
    50% of these development expenses, including 50% of the
    $25.0 million payment received in connection with the
    January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement, in
    accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
    expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan
    royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. In addition, if
    the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product for intraocular
    delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale of a VEGF
    Trap product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin
    reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of VEGF
    Trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the
    first commercial VEGF Trap sale under the collaboration occurs.
    Since inception of the collaboration agreement through
    December 31, 2006, we and sanofi-aventis have incurred
    $205.0 million in agreed upon development expenses related
    to the VEGF Trap program. We and sanofi-aventis plan to initiate
    in 2007 multiple additional clinical studies to evaluate the
    VEGF Trap as both a single agent and in combination with other
    therapies in various cancer indications.

Sanofi-aventis funded $47.8 million, $43.4 million,
    and $67.8 million, respectively, of our VEGF Trap
    development costs in 2006, 2005, and 2004, of which
    $6.8 million, $10.5 million, and $13.9 million,
    respectively, were included in accounts receivable as of
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. In addition, we have
    received up-front payments of $80.0 million in September
    2003 and $25.0 million in January 2006 from sanofi-aventis
    in connection with our collaboration. Both up-front payments
    were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as
    contract research and development revenue ratably over the
    period during which we expect to perform services. In 2006 and
    2005, we recognized $11.4 million and $9.5 million of
    revenue, respectively, related to these up-front payments.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap
    development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
    rights to the VEGF Trap.



Collaboration
    with Bayer Healthcare:

Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer, as described under
    “Collaborations” above, agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye
    development expenses incurred by both companies, beginning in
    2007, under a global development plan, will be shared as follows:

2007:

Up to $50.0 million shared equally; we are solely
    responsible for up to the next $40.0 million; over
    $90.0 million shared equally.

2008:

Up to $70.0 million shared equally, we are solely
    responsible for up to the next $30.0 million; over
    $100.0 million shared equally.

2009 and thereafter: All expenses shared equally.

Neither party will be reimbursed for any development expenses
    that it incurred prior to 2007.

We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
    supply clinical and commercial product requirements.

If the VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing authorization in a
    major market country outside the United States and the
    collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to
    reimburse Bayer out of our share of the collaboration profits
    for 50% of the agreed upon development expenses that Bayer has
    incurred in accordance with a formula based on the amount of
    development expenses that Bayer has incurred and our share of
    the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option. In
    wet AMD, we and Bayer plan in 2007 to complete our Phase 2
    clinical study of the VEGF Trap-Eye currently in progress and to
    initiate the Phase 3 clinical program.

In October 2006, we received a $75.0 million up-front
    payment from Bayer in connection with our collaboration, which
    was recorded to deferred revenue. When we and Bayer have
    formalized our projected global development plans for the VEGF
    Trap-Eye, as well as the projected responsibilities of each of
    the companies under those development plans, we will begin
    recognizing revenue related to payments from Bayer.

Bayer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause
    with at least six months or twelve months advance notice
    depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination.
    In the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, we
    retain all rights to the VEGF Trap-Eye.

National
    Institutes of Health Grant:

Under our five-year grant from the NIH, as described under
    “Other Agreements” above, we will be entitled to
    receive a minimum of $17.9 million over a five-year period,
    subject to compliance with the grant’s terms and annual
    funding approvals, and another $1.0 million to optimize our
    existing C57BL/6 ES cell line and its proprietary growth medium.
    In 2006, we recognized $0.5 million of revenue related to
    the NIH Grant, which was receivable at the end of 2006. In 2007,
    we expect to receive funding of approximately $5 million
    for reimbursement of Regeneron expenses related to the NIH Grant.

License
    Agreement with AstraZeneca:

Under our non-exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca, as
    described under “Other Agreements” above, AstraZeneca
    made a $20.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us
    in February 2007. AstraZeneca also will make up to five
    additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to its
    ability to terminate the agreement after making the first three
    additional payments or if the technology does not meet minimum
    performance criteria.

Severance
    Costs:

In September 2005, we announced plans to reduce our workforce by
    approximately 165 employees in connection with narrowing the
    focus of our research and development efforts, substantial
    improvements in manufacturing productivity, the September 2005
    expiration of our collaboration with Procter & Gamble,
    and the completion of contract manufacturing for Merck in late
    2006. The majority of the headcount reduction occurred in the
    fourth quarter of 2005. The remaining headcount reductions
    occurred in 2006 as we completed activities related to contract
    manufacturing for Merck.



Costs associated with the workforce reduction were comprised
    principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, and outplacement services. Termination costs
    related to 2005 workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth
    quarter of 2005, and included $0.2 million of non-cash
    expenses. Estimated termination costs associated with the
    workforce reduction in 2006 were measured in October 2005 and
    expensed ratably over the expected service period of the
    affected employees in accordance with SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities.

Total costs associated with the 2005 and 2006
    workforce reductions were $2.6 million, of which
    $2.2 million was charged to expense in the fourth quarter
    of 2005 and $0.4 million was charged to expense in 2006.

Convertible
    Debt:

In 2001, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private
    placement and received proceeds, after deducting the initial
    purchasers’ discount and out-of pocket expenses, of
    $192.7 million. The notes bear interest at 5.5% per
    annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in 2008. The notes are
    convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion
    price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to
    adjustment in certain circumstances. We may redeem some or all
    of the notes if the closing price of our Common Stock has
    exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in effect for a
    specified period of time.

New
    Operating Lease — Tarrytown, New York
    Facilities

In December 2006, we entered into a new operating lease
    agreement for approximately 221,000 square feet of
    laboratory and office space at our current Tarrytown location.
    The new lease includes approximately 27,000 square feet
    that we currently occupy (our retained facilities) and
    approximately 194,000 square feet to be located in new
    facilities that will be constructed and which are expected to be
    completed in early-2009. The term of the lease is expected to
    commence in early 2008 and will expire approximately
    16 years later. Under the new lease we also have various
    options and rights on additional space at the Tarrytown site,
    and will continue to lease our present facilities until the new
    facilities are ready for occupancy. In addition, the lease
    contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease
    by five years each and early termination options for our
    retained facilities only. The lease provides for monthly
    payments over the term of the lease related to our retained
    facilities, the costs of construction and tenant improvements
    for our new facilities, and additional charges for utilities,
    taxes, and operating expenses.

In connection with the new lease agreement, in December 2006, we
    issued a letter of credit in the amount of $1.6 million to
    our landlord, which is collateralized by a $1.6 million
    bank certificate of deposit.

Capital
    Expenditures:

Our additions to property, plant, and equipment totaled
    $3.3 million in 2006, $4.7 million in 2005, and
    $6.0 million in 2004. In 2007, we expect to incur
    approximately $15 million in capital expenditures
    primarily  to support our manufacturing, development, and
    research activities.

Funding
    Requirements:

Our total expenses for research and development from inception
    through December 31, 2006 have been approximately
    $1,150 million. We have entered into various agreements
    related to our activities to develop and commercialize product
    candidates and utilize our technology platforms, including
    collaboration agreements, such as those with sanofi-aventis and
    Bayer, and agreements to use our
    Velocigene

®

technology platform. We incurred expenses associated with these
    agreements, which include an allocable portion of general and
    administrative costs, of $43.4 million, $42.2 million,
    and $75.3 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

We expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements
    primarily for research and development activities (including
    preclinical and clinical testing). Before taking into account
    reimbursements from collaborators, we currently anticipate that
    approximately 55%-65% of our expenditures for 2007 will be
    directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of
    product candidates, including the IL-1 Trap, VEGF Trap, VEGF
    Trap-Eye, and monoclonal antibodies; approximately 15%-25% of
    our expenditures for 2007 will be applied to our basic research
    activities and the continued development of our novel technology
    platforms; and the remainder of our expenditures for 2007 will
    be used for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.



In connection with our funding requirements, the following table
    summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31,
    2006 for leases and long-term debt.

Includes projected obligations based, in part, upon budgeted

    operating lease for facilities to be constructed in Tarrytown,
    New York, as described above. Excludes future contingent rental
    costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses.
    In 2006, these costs were $8.7 million.

In connection with certain clinical trial contracts with service
    providers, we may incur early termination penalties if the
    contracts are cancelled before

agreed-upon

services are completed.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend on various
    factors, including the status of competitive products, the
    success of our research and development programs, the potential
    future need to expand our professional and support staff and
    facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual
    property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any
    of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent,
    and success of our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer.
    Clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the
    size and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided
    by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the
    costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the
    trials, supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The
    amount of funding that will be required for our clinical
    programs depends upon the results of our research and
    preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory
    requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials
    underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to
    initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each
    trial as described above. In the future, if we are able to
    successfully develop, market, and sell certain of our product
    candidates, we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise
    share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our
    collaboration and licensing agreements.

We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution,
    defense, and enforcement of patent and other intellectual
    property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of
    patent filings and prosecutions in the United States and foreign
    countries.

We believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to
    meet operating needs through at least early 2010, without taking
    into consideration the $200.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior subordinated notes, which mature in
    October 2008. However, this is a forward-looking statement based
    on our current operating plan, and there may be a change in
    projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital
    being consumed significantly before such time. If there is
    insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and
    activities, we believe we would prioritize available capital to
    fund preclinical and clinical development of our product
    candidates. Other than the $1.6 million letter of credit
    issued to our landlord in connection with our new operating
    lease for facilities in Tarrytown, New York, as described above,
    we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we do
    not guarantee the obligations of any other entity. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had no established banking
    arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing
    or a line of credit. In the event we need additional financing
    for the operation of our business, we will consider
    collaborative arrangements and additional public or private
    financing, including additional equity financing. Factors
    influencing the availability of additional financing include our
    progress in product development, investor perception of our
    prospects, and the general condition of the financial markets.
    We may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new
    collaborative arrangements or additional public or private
    offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our



capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or
    eliminate certain of our research and development activities or
    future operations. This could materially harm our business.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
    Estimates

Revenue
    Recognition:

We recognize revenue from contract research and development and
    research progress payments in accordance with Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104) and Emerging Issues Task Force

00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
    Deliverables

(EITF

00-21).

We
    earn contract research and development revenue and research
    progress payments in connection with collaboration and other
    agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and
    utilize our technology platforms. The terms of these agreements
    typically include non-refundable up-front licensing payments,
    research progress (milestone) payments, and payments for
    development activities. Non-refundable up-front license
    payments, where continuing involvement is required of us, are
    deferred and recognized over the related performance period. We
    estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of
    each agreement, and adjust the performance periods, if
    appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances.
    Our performance period estimates are principally based on the
    results and progress of our research and development activities
    and revisions to these estimates could result in changes to the
    amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In
    addition, if a collaborator terminates the agreement in
    accordance with the terms of the contract, we would recognize
    the remainder of the up-front payment at the time of the
    termination. Payments which are based on achieving a specific
    substantive performance milestone, involving a degree of risk,
    are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the
    related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no
    future service obligation associated with that milestone, a
    reasonable amount of time has passed between receipt of an
    up-front payment and achievement of the milestone, and the
    amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the
    effort, value, and risk associated with achieving the milestone.
    Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered
    substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized
    over the related performance period. Payments for development
    activities are recognized as revenue as earned, over the period
    of effort. In addition, we record revenue in connection with a
    government research grant as we incur expenses related to the
    grant, subject to the grant’s terms and annual funding
    approvals.

Recognition
    of Deferred Revenue Related to Contract Manufacturing
    Agreement:

We entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with Merck,
    which expired in October 2006, under which we manufactured a
    vaccine intermediate at our Rensselaer, New York facility and
    performed services. We recognized contract manufacturing revenue
    from this agreement after the product was tested and approved
    by, and shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck, and as services
    were performed. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to
    modify portions of our Rensselaer facility to manufacture
    Merck’s vaccine intermediate and Merck agreed to reimburse
    us for the related capital costs. These capital cost payments
    were deferred and recognized as revenue as product was shipped
    to Merck, based upon our estimate of Merck’s order
    quantities each year through the expected end of the agreement
    which, for 2004 and prior years, was October 2005. In February
    2005, we agreed to extend the manufacturing agreement by one
    year through October 2006. Since we commenced production of the
    vaccine intermediate in November 1999, our estimates of
    Merck’s order quantities each year were not materially
    different from Merck’s actual orders.

Clinical
    Trial Accrual Estimates:

For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial
    costs, which are included in research and development expenses,
    are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in
    the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and the
    period over which clinical investigators or contract research
    organizations are expected to provide services. We believe that
    this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts
    we expend on a clinical trial. During the course of a trial, we
    adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual
    results differ from our estimates. No material adjustments to
    our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.



Depreciation
    of Property, Plant, and Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
    is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
    are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
    depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
    removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
    recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

7-30 years

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
    lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of
    construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized
    interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of
    the related asset.

In some situations, the life of the asset may be extended or
    shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe
    that the estimated life of the asset has changed. The life of
    leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of
    lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in the estimated
    lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the
    amount of depreciation recognized in future periods.

Stock-based
    Employee Compensation:

Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value based
    method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under
    the provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, using the modified prospective method as
    described in SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.

As a
    result, in 2005, we recognized compensation expense, in an
    amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments
    (including stock option awards) on their date of grant, over the
    vesting period of the awards using graded vesting, which is an
    accelerated expense recognition method. Under the modified
    prospective method, compensation expense for Regeneron is
    recognized for (a) all share based payments granted on or
    after January 1, 2005 and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date. Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, we
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in APB 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
    interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense related to
    employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses
    in any period prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior
    period operating results have not been restated.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which is a revision
    of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting
    for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
    share-based payment transactions, and requires the recognition
    of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of
    the share-based payment (including stock options and restricted
    stock) issued to employees. SFAS 123R requires companies to
    estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited
    at the time of grant and to revise this estimate, if necessary,
    in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Effective January 1, 2005, and prior to our
    adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized the effect of
    forfeitures in stock-based compensation cost in the period when
    they occurred, in accordance with SFAS 123. Upon adoption
    of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, we were
    required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the
    effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards
    that are not expected to vest as of the SFAS 123R adoption
    date. This adjustment reduced our loss by $0.8 million and
    is included in our operating results for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as a cumulative-effect adjustment of a
    change in accounting principle.

We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
    each option granted under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Using this model, fair value is
    calculated based on assumptions with respect to
    (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of our board of directors are expected to hold their options
    prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend
    yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
    rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
    securities with maturities approximating the options’
    expected lives. Expected volatility has been estimated based on
    actual movements in our stock price over the most recent
    historical



periods equivalent to the options’ expected lives. Expected
    lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise
    experience with option grants with similar exercise prices. The
    expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends
    and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable
    future.

Future
    Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109.

This interpretation clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
    transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. We will be required to adopt
    FIN 48 effective for the fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2007. Our management believes that the adoption
    of this standard will not have a material impact on our
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

, which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair
    value measurements. We will be required to adopt SFAS 157
    effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008.
    Our management is currently evaluating the potential impact of
    adopting SFAS 157 on our financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to
    changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of
    available cash balances in investment grade corporate,
    asset-backed, and U.S. government securities. We do not
    believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates.
    Under our current policies we do not use interest rate
    derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate
    changes. We estimated that a one percent change in interest
    rates would result in changes in the fair market value of our
    investment portfolio of approximately $1.7 million and
    $0.5 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase in the impact of an interest rate
    change at December 31, 2006, compared to December 31,
    2005, is due primarily to increases in our investment
    portfolio’s balance and duration to maturity at the end of
    2006 versus the end of 2005.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of our
    chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted
    an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer each concluded that, as of the end of such
    period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
    ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on
    a timely basis, and is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



Management
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation
    of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting using the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
    evaluation our management has concluded that our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2006. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our
    independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a
    report on management’s assessment and the effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, which report is included herein at

page F-2.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting
    will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
    matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
    reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
    system are met and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the
    inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
    controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
    and instances of fraud or deviations, if any, within the company
    have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board
    of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Financial
    statements

In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the
    accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
    the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
    an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
    conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in note 2 to the financial statements,
    effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method
    of accounting for share-based payment, to conform with FASB
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-based Payment.” On
    January 1, 2005, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for stock-based employee compensation, to conform
    with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.”

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-2


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

1.

Organization
    and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or
    “Regeneron”) was incorporated in January 1988 in the
    State of New York. The Company is engaged in research and
    development programs to discover and commercialize therapeutics
    to treat human disorders and conditions. The Company’s
    facilities are located in New York. The Company’s business
    is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to,
    uncertainties relating to conducting pharmaceutical research,
    obtaining regulatory approvals, commercializing products, and
    obtaining and enforcing patents.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and the balance
    sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
    with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported in the balance
    sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    determined based on standards that approximate the

first-in,

first-out method. Inventories are shown net of applicable
    reserves.

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
    is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
    are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
    depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
    removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
    recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

7-30 years

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
    lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of
    construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized
    interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of
    the related asset.

Accounting
    for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of
    long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and
    evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is determined to exist
    if estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the
    carrying amount in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 144,

Accounting
    for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

For all
    periods presented, no impairment losses were recorded.

Patents

As a result of the Company’s research and development
    efforts, the Company has obtained, applied for, or is applying
    for, a number of patents to protect proprietary technology and
    inventions. All costs associated with patents are expensed as
    incurred.

Revenue
    Recognition

a.
    Contract Research and Development and Research Progress
    Payments

The Company recognizes revenue from contract research and
    development and research progress payments in accordance with
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue
    Recognition

(“SAB 104”) and FASB Emerging
    Issue Task Force Issue

No. 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
    Deliverables

(“EITF

00-21”).

Contract research and development revenue and research progress
    payments are earned by the Company in connection with
    collaboration and other agreements to develop and commercialize
    product candidates and utilize the Company’s technology
    platforms. The terms of these agreements typically include
    non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress
    (milestone) payments, and payments for development activities.
    Non-refundable up-front license payments, where continuing
    involvement is required of the Company, are deferred and
    recognized over the related performance period. The Company
    estimates its performance period based on the specific terms of
    each agreement, and adjusts the performance periods, if
    appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances.
    Payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive
    performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are
    recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the
    related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no
    future service obligation associated with that milestone, a
    reasonable amount of time has passed between receipt of an
    up-front payment and achievement of the milestone, and the
    amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the
    effort, value, and risk associated with achieving the milestone.
    Payments for achieving milestones which are not considered
    substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized
    over the related performance period. Payments for development
    activities are recognized as revenue as earned, over the period
    of effort. In addition, we record revenue in connection with a
    government research grant as we incur expenses related to the
    grant, subject to the grant’s terms and annual funding
    approvals.

b.
    Contract Manufacturing

The Company manufactured product and performed services for a
    third party under a contract manufacturing agreement which
    expired in October 2006. Contract manufacturing revenue was
    recognized as product was shipped and as services were performed
    (see Note 13).

Investment
    Income

Interest income, which is included in investment income, is
    recognized as earned.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs directly
    attributable to the conduct of research and development
    programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
    maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
    collaboration and licensing agreements (see Note 11d), the
    cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
    services related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical
    trial expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
    research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, expenses
    related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to
    commencing commercial production of a product under contract
    manufacturing arrangements, and the allocable portions of
    facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and
    maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All
    costs associated with research and development are expensed as
    incurred.

For each clinical trial that the Company conducts, certain
    clinical trial costs, which are included in research and
    development expenses, are expensed based on the expected total
    number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients
    enter the trial, and the period over which clinical
    investigators or contract research organizations are

    share data)

expected to provide services. During the course of a clinical
    trial, the Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense
    recognition if actual results differ from the Company’s
    estimates.

Per
    Share Data

Net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is computed on
    the basis of the net income (loss) for the period divided by the
    weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
    Class A Stock outstanding during the period. The basic net
    income (loss) per share excludes restricted stock awards until
    vested. The diluted net income per share is based upon the
    weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
    Class A Stock outstanding, and of common stock equivalents
    outstanding when dilutive. Common stock equivalents include:
    (i) outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards
    under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plans, which are
    included under the treasury stock method when dilutive, and
    (ii) Common Stock to be issued under the assumed conversion
    of the Company’s outstanding convertible senior
    subordinated notes, which are included under the if-converted
    method when dilutive. The computation of diluted net loss per
    share for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 does
    not include common stock equivalents, since such inclusion would
    be antidilutive. The computation of diluted net income per share
    for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes dilutive
    common stock equivalents. Disclosures required by SFAS 128,

Earnings per Share

, have been included in Note 19.

Income
    Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
    method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined on
    the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts
    (“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in
    effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
    reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax
    assets for which realization is uncertain. See Note 17.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) represents the change in net assets
    of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
    other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
    Comprehensive income (loss) of the Company includes net income
    (loss) adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or loss on
    marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
    comprehensive income (loss) is immaterial. Comprehensive income
    for the year ended December 31, 2004 and comprehensive
    losses for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 have
    been included in the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents,
    marketable securities, and receivables from the sanofi-aventis
    Group. The Company generally invests its excess cash in
    obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, bank
    deposits, asset-backed securities, investment grade debt
    securities issued by corporations, governments, and financial
    institutions, and money market funds that invest in these
    instruments. The Company has established guidelines that relate
    to credit quality, diversification, and maturity, and that limit
    exposure to any one issue of securities.

Risks
    and Uncertainties

Regeneron has had no sales of its products and there is no
    assurance that the Company’s research and development
    efforts will be successful, that the Company will ever have
    commercially approved products, or that the Company will achieve
    significant sales of any such products. The Company has
    generally incurred net losses

REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

and negative cash flows from operations since its inception.
    Revenues to date have principally been limited to
    (i) payments from the Company’s collaborators and
    other entities for the Company’s development activities
    with respect to product candidates and to utilize the
    Company’s technology platforms, (ii) payments from two
    pharmaceutical companies for contract manufacturing, and
    (iii) investment income. The Company operates in an
    environment of rapid change in technology and is dependent upon
    the services of its employees, consultants, collaborators, and
    certain third-party suppliers, including single-source
    unaffiliated third-party suppliers of certain raw materials and
    equipment. Regeneron, as licensee, licenses certain technologies
    that are important to the Company’s business which impose
    various obligations on the Company. If Regeneron fails to comply
    with these requirements, licensors may have the right to
    terminate the Company’s licenses.

Contract research and development revenue in 2006 was primarily
    earned from sanofi-aventis under a collaboration agreement (see
    Note 12a). The Company recognizes revenue from its
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis in accordance with
    SAB 104 and EITF

00-21,

as
    described above. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement,
    agreed upon VEGF Trap development expenses incurred by Regeneron
    during the term of the agreement will be funded by
    sanofi-aventis. In addition, the Company earns revenue related
    to non-refundable, up-front payments from sanofi-aventis. The
    Company also may receive up to $400.0 million in milestone
    payments upon receipt of specified VEGF Trap marketing
    approvals. Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the
    agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance
    notice.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
    include (i) useful lives of property, plant, and equipment,
    (ii) the periods over which certain revenues and expenses
    will be recognized including contract research and development
    revenue recognized from non-refundable up-front payments and
    expense recognition of certain clinical trial costs which are
    included in research and development expenses, (iii) the
    extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset
    by a valuation allowance, and (iv) the fair value of stock
    options on their date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model, based on assumptions with respect to
    (a) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (b) the periods of time over which employees and members of
    the Company’s board of directors are expected to hold their
    options prior to exercise (expected lives), (c) expected
    dividend yield on the Company’s Common Stock, and
    (d) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted
    U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities
    approximating the options’ expected lives. In addition, in
    connection with the recognition of compensation expense in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R,

Share-Based
    Payment

, as described below, the Company is required to
    estimate, at the time of grant, the number of stock option
    awards that are expected to be forfeited.

Stock-based
    Employee Compensation

Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair
    value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
    compensation under the provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, using the
    modified prospective method as described in SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure.

As a result, in 2005, the Company
    recognized compensation expense, in an amount equal to the fair
    value of share-based payments (including stock option awards) on
    their date of grant, over the vesting period of the awards using
    graded vesting, which is an accelerated expense recognition
    method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation
    expense for the Company is recognized for (a) all share
    based payments granted on or after January 1, 2005
    (including replacement options granted under the Company’s
    stock option exchange program which concluded on January 5,
    2005 (see Note 14)) and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date.

F-12


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which
    is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R focuses primarily
    on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains
    employee services in share-based payment transactions, and
    requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount
    equal to the fair value of the share-based payment (including
    stock options and restricted stock) issued to employees.
    SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate, at the time of
    grant, the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited
    and to revise this estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods
    if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Effective
    January 1, 2005, and prior to the Company’s adoption
    of SFAS 123R, the Company recognized the effect of
    forfeitures in stock-based compensation cost in the period when
    they occurred, in accordance with SFAS 123. Upon adoption
    of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, the Company
    was required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect
    the effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding
    awards that are not expected to vest as of the SFAS 123R
    adoption date. This adjustment reduced the Company’s loss
    by $0.8 million and is included in the Company’s
    operating results in 2006 as a cumulative-effect adjustment of a
    change in accounting principle.

Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, the Company
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. (“APB”) 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
    interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense related to
    employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses
    in any period prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior
    period results have not been restated. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, $18.4 million and
    $19.9 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based
    employee compensation expense related to stock option awards
    (“Stock Option Expense”) was recognized in operating
    expenses. In addition, for the year ended December 31,
    2005, $0.1 million of Stock Option Expense was capitalized
    in inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2004, had the
    Company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for
    stock-based employee compensation under the provisions of
    SFAS 123, Stock Option Expense would have totaled
    $33.6 million and the effect on the Company’s net
    income and net income per share would have been as follows:

In 2004, the Company awarded 105,052 shares of Restricted
    Stock under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Long-Term
    Incentive Plan (see Notes 14). No Restricted Stock was
    awarded in 2006 or 2005. The Company records unearned
    compensation in Stockholders’ Equity related to these
    awards based on the fair market value of shares of

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date of the
    Restricted Stock award, which is expensed, on a pro rata basis,
    over the period that the restrictions on these shares lapse. In
    2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company recognized $0.3 million,
    $1.9 million, and $2.5 million, respectively, of
    compensation expense related to Restricted Stock awards.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $0.8 million,
    $0.2 million, and $0.6 million of capital
    expenditures, respectively.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
    December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $1.9 million,
    $0.6 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, of
    accrued 401(k) Savings Plan contribution expense. During the
    first quarter of 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company contributed
    120,960, 90,385, and 64,333 shares, respectively, of Common
    Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in satisfaction of these
    obligations.

Included in marketable securities at December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were $1.5 million, $1.2 million, and
    $2.6 million of accrued interest income, respectively.

Future
    Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No, 109. This
    interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for
    Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
    Company will be required to adopt FIN 48 effective for the
    fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007. Management believes
    that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value
    Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework
    for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
    principles (“GAAP”), and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. The Company will be required to adopt
    SFAS 157 effective for the fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the
    potential impact of adopting SFAS 157 on the Company’s
    financial statements.

3.

Severance
    Costs

In September 2005, the Company announced plans to reduce its
    workforce by approximately 165 employees in connection with
    narrowing the focus of the Company’s research and
    development efforts, substantial improvements in manufacturing
    productivity, the June 2005 expiration of the Company’s
    collaboration with The Procter & Gamble Company, and
    the completion of contract manufacturing for Merck &
    Co., Inc. in late 2006. The majority of the headcount reduction
    occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. The remaining headcount
    reductions occurred during 2006 as the Company completed
    activities related to contract manufacturing for Merck.

Costs associated with the workforce reduction are comprised
    principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, and outplacement services. Termination costs
    related to 2005 workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth
    quarter of 2005, and included non-cash expenses due to the
    accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted
    stock held by affected employees. Estimated termination costs
    associated with the planned workforce reduction in 2006 were
    measured in October 2005 and were expensed ratably over the
    expected service period of the affected employees in accordance
    with SFAS 146,

In addition, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006
    and 2005 included an unrealized holding gain of $12 thousand and

Realized gains and losses are included as a component of
    investment income. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004, gross realized gains and losses were not
    significant. In computing realized gains and losses, the Company
    computes the cost of its investments on a specific
    identification basis. Such cost includes the direct costs to
    acquire the securities, adjusted for the amortization of any
    discount or premium. The fair value of marketable securities has
    been estimated based on quoted market prices.

The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in
    corporate debt securities, U.S. government securities, and
    asset-backed securities were primarily caused by interest rate
    increases, which generally resulted in a decrease in the market
    value of the Company’s portfolio. Based upon the
    Company’s currently projected sources and uses of cash, the
    Company intends to hold these securities until a recovery of
    fair value, which may be maturity. Therefore, the Company does
    not consider these marketable securities at December 31,
    2006 and 2005 to be

Stockholders
    Equity

The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
    amended, provides for the issuance of up to 40 million
    shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and
    160 million shares of Common Stock, par value
    $0.001 per share. Shares of Class A Stock are
    convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into
    shares of Common Stock on a

share-for-share

basis. Holders of Class A Stock have rights and privileges
    identical to Common Stockholders except that Class A
    Stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share, while Common
    Stockholders are entitled to one vote per share. Class A
    Stock may only be transferred to specified Permitted
    Transferees, as defined. Under the Company’s Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, the Company’s
    Board of Directors (the “Board”) is authorized to
    issue up to 30 million shares of preferred stock, in
    series, with rights, privileges, and qualifications of each
    series determined by the Board.

In October 2001, the Company completed a private placement of
    $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior
    subordinated notes, which are convertible into shares of the
    Company’s Common Stock. See Note 11c.

In August 2003, Regeneron issued to Merck & Co., Inc.,
    109,450 newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s
    Common Stock as consideration for a non-exclusive license
    agreement granted by Merck to the Company. In August 2004, the
    Company repurchased these shares from Merck for a purchase price
    of $0.9 million based on the fair market value of the
    shares on August 19, 2004. The shares were subsequently
    retired. See Note 11d.

In November 2006, the Company completed a public offering of
    7.6 million shares of Common Stock at a price of
    $23.03 per share and received proceeds, after expenses, of
    $174.6 million.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

a.

Operating
    Leases

The Company currently leases approximately 236,000 square
    feet of laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York
    under operating lease agreements. In December 2006, the Company
    entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately
    221,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at the
    Company’s current Tarrytown location. The new lease
    includes approximately 27,000 square feet that the Company
    currently occupies (the “retained facilities”) and
    approximately 194,000 square feet to be located in new
    facilities that will be

F-19

    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

constructed and which are expected to be completed in early
    2009. The term of the lease is expected to commence in
    early-2008 and will expire approximately 16 years later.
    Under the new lease the Company also has various options and
    rights on additional space at the Tarrytown site, and will
    continue to lease its present facilities until the new
    facilities are ready for occupancy. In addition, the lease
    contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease
    by five years each and early termination options for the
    Company’s retained facilities only. The lease provides for
    monthly payments over the term of the lease related to the
    Company’s retained facilities, the costs of construction
    and tenant improvements for the Company’s new facilities,
    and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating
    expenses.

In connection with the new lease agreement, in December 2006,
    the Company issued a letter of credit in the amount of
    $1.6 million to its landlord, which is collateralized by a
    $1.6 million bank certificate of deposit. The certificate
    of deposit has been classified as restricted cash at
    December 31, 2006 in the accompanying financial statements.

The Company also leases manufacturing, office, and warehouse
    facilities in Rensselaer, New York under an operating lease
    agreement which expires in July 2012 and contains a renewal
    option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term and
    a purchase option. The leases provide for base rent plus
    additional rental charges for utilities, taxes, and operating
    expenses, as defined.

The Company leases certain laboratory and office equipment under
    operating leases which expire at various times through 2010.

Based, in part, upon budgeted construction and tenant
    improvement costs related to our new operating lease for
    facilities to be constructed in Tarrytown, New York, as
    described above, at December 31, 2006, the estimated future
    minimum noncancelable lease commitments under operating leases
    were as follows:

    $9.5 million, and $6.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

b.  Loan
    Payable

In March 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement with Novartis Pharma AG. In accordance with that
    agreement, Regeneron funded its share of 2003 collaboration
    development expenses through a loan from

F-20


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

Novartis, which bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the
    LIBOR rate plus 2.5%, compounded quarterly. In March 2004,
    Novartis forgave its outstanding loan to Regeneron totaling
    $17.8 million, including accrued interest, based on
    Regeneron’s achieving a pre-defined development milestone.
    See Note 12c.

c.  Convertible
    Debt

In October 2001, the Company issued $200.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated
    notes (“Notes”) in a private placement for proceeds to
    the Company of $192.7 million, after deducting the initial
    purchasers’ discount and

out-of-pocket

expenses (collectively, “Deferred Financing Costs”).
    The Notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable
    semi-annually, and mature on October 17, 2008. Deferred
    Financing Costs, which are included in other assets, are
    amortized as interest expense over the period from the
    Notes’ issuance to stated maturity. The Notes are
    convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into
    shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price
    of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to adjustment in
    certain circumstances. Regeneron may also redeem some or all of
    the Notes at any time if the closing price of the Company’s
    Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in
    effect for a specified period of time. The fair market value of
    the Notes fluctuates over time. The estimated fair value of the
    Notes at December 31, 2006 was approximately
    $209.4 million.

d.  Research
    Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company’s research and development efforts,
    the Company enters into research collaboration and licensing
    agreements with related and unrelated companies, scientific
    collaborators, universities, and consultants. These agreements
    contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and
    milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be provided,
    and ownership rights to certain proprietary technology developed
    under the agreements. Some of the agreements contain provisions
    which require the Company to pay royalties, as defined, at rates
    that range from 0.25% to 16.5%, in the event the Company sells
    or licenses any proprietary products developed under the
    respective agreements.

Certain agreements under which the Company is required to pay
    fees permit the Company, upon 30 to

90-day

written notice, to terminate such agreements. With respect to
    payments associated with these agreements, the Company incurred
    expenses of $1.1 million, $1.0 million, and
    $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively.

In July 2002, Amgen Inc. and Immunex Corporation (now part of
    Amgen) granted the Company a non-exclusive license to certain
    patents and patent applications which may be used in the
    development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap. The license
    followed two other licensing arrangements under which Regeneron
    obtained a non-exclusive license to patents owned by
    ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Tularik Inc. for use in connection with
    the IL-1 Trap program. These license agreements would require
    the Company to pay royalties based on the net sales of the IL-1
    Trap if and when it is approved for sale. In total, the royalty
    rate under these three agreements would be in the mid-single
    digits.

In August 2003, Merck & Co., Inc. granted the Company a
    non-exclusive license agreement to certain patents and patent
    applications which may be used in the development and
    commercialization of products that act on the ciliary
    neurotrophic factor, or CNTF, receptor for the treatment of
    obesity. As consideration, the Company issued to Merck 109,450
    newly issued unregistered shares of its Common Stock (the
    “Merck Shares”), valued at $1.5 million based on
    the fair market value of shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock on the agreement’s effective date. In August 2004,
    the Company repurchased from Merck, and subsequently retired,
    the Merck Shares for $0.9 million based on the fair market
    value of the shares on August 19, 2004. The Company also
    made a cash payment of $0.6 million to Merck as required
    under the license agreement. The agreement also requires the
    Company to make an additional payment to Merck upon receipt of
    marketing approval for a product covered by the licensed
    patents. In

F-21


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

addition, the Company would be required to pay royalties, at
    staggered rates in the mid-single digits, based on the net sales
    of products covered by the licensed patents.

12.

Research
    and Development Agreements

The Company has entered into various agreements related to its
    activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and
    utilize its technology platforms. Amounts earned by the Company
    in connection with these agreements, which were recognized as
    contract research and development revenue, research progress
    payments, or other contract income, as applicable, totaled
    $51.1 million, $83.1 million, and $198.7 million
    in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Total Company incurred
    expenses associated with these agreements, which include
    reimbursable and non-reimbursable amounts and an allocable
    portion of general and administrative costs, were
    $43.4 million, $42.2 million and $75.3 million in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Significant agreements of
    this kind are described below.

a.  The
    sanofi-aventis Group

In September 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement (the “Aventis Agreement”) with the Aventis
    Pharmaceuticals Inc. (now a member of the sanofi-aventis Group),
    to jointly develop and commercialize the Company’s Vascular
    Endothelial Growth Factor (“VEGF”) Trap. In connection
    with this agreement, sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable
    up-front payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552
    newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the
    Aventis Agreement to exclude intraocular delivery of the VEGF
    Trap to the eye (“Intraocular Delivery”) from joint
    development under the agreement, and product rights to the VEGF
    Trap in Intraocular Delivery reverted to Regeneron. In
    connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a
    $25.0 million non-refundable payment to Regeneron (the
    “Intraocular Termination Payment”) in January 2005.

In December 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the
    Aventis Agreement to expand the territory in which the companies
    are collaborating on the development of the VEGF Trap to include
    Japan. In connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis agreed
    to make a $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to
    the Company, which was received in January 2006. Under the
    Aventis Agreement, as amended, the Company and sanofi-aventis
    will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of
    the VEGF Trap outside of Japan, for disease indications included
    in the companies’ collaboration. The Company is entitled to
    a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of the VEGF Trap
    in Japan, subject to certain potential adjustments. The Company
    may also receive up to $400.0 million in additional
    milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing
    approvals. This total includes up to $360.0 million in
    milestone payments related to the receipt of marketing approvals
    for up to eight VEGF Trap oncology and other indications in the
    United States or the European Union. Another $40.0 million
    of milestone payments relate to receipt of marketing approvals
    for up to five VEGF Trap oncology indications in Japan. In
    December 2004, the Company earned a $25.0 million payment
    from sanofi-aventis, which was received in January 2005, upon
    the achievement of an early-stage clinical milestone.

Under the Aventis Agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide
    development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
    of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the
    collaboration becomes profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses,
    or half of $205.0 million as of December 31, 2006, in
    accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
    expenses and Regeneron’s share of the collaboration profits
    and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at Regeneron’s
    option. Regeneron has the option to conduct additional
    pre-Phase III studies at its own expense. In connection
    with the January 2005 amendment to the Aventis Agreement, the
    Intraocular Termination Payment of $25.0 million will be
    considered a VEGF Trap development expense and will be subject
    to 50% reimbursement by Regeneron to

F-22


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

sanofi-aventis, as described above, if the collaboration becomes
    profitable. In addition, if the first commercial sale of a VEGF
    Trap product in Intraocular Delivery predates the first
    commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product under the collaboration
    by two years, Regeneron will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis
    for up to $7.5 million of VEGF Trap development expenses in
    accordance with a formula until the first commercial VEGF Trap
    sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, Regeneron’s
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis, for 50% of VEGF Trap
    development expenses will terminate, and the Company will retain
    all rights to the VEGF Trap.

Revenue related to payments from sanofi-aventis is being
    recognized in accordance with SAB 104 and EITF

00-21

(see
    Note 2). The up-front payments received in September 2003
    and January 2006, of $80.0 million and $25.0 million,
    respectively, and reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred
    development expenses, are being recognized as contract research
    and development revenue over the related performance period.
    Milestone payments are classified as research progress payments.
    In addition to the $25.0 million research progress payment
    earned in 2004, the Company recognized $47.8 million,
    $43.4 million, and $78.3 million of contract research
    and development revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
    in connection with the Aventis Agreement. The Company also
    recognized the $25.0 million Intraocular Termination
    Payment as other contract income in 2005. At December 31,
    2006 and 2005, amounts receivable from sanofi-aventis totaled
    $6.9 million and $36.4 million, respectively, and
    deferred revenue was $70.0 million and $81.6 million,
    respectively.

b.  Bayer
    Healthcare LLC

In October 2006, the Company entered into a license and
    collaboration agreement (the “Bayer Agreement”) with
    Bayer HealthCare LLC to globally develop, and commercialize
    outside the United States, the Company’s VEGF Trap for the
    treatment of eye disease by local administration (“VEGF
    Trap-Eye”). Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer made a
    non-refundable up-front payment to the Company of
    $75.0 million. In addition, the Company is eligible to
    receive up to $110.0 million in development and regulatory
    milestones, including a total of $40.0 million upon the
    initiation of Phase 3 trials in defined major indications.
    The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional
    $135.0 million in sales milestones when and if total annual
    sales of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States achieve
    certain specified levels starting at $200.0 million.

The Company will share equally with Bayer in any future profits
    arising from the commercialization of the VEGF Trap-Eye outside
    the United States. If the VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing
    authorization in a major market country outside the United
    States and the collaboration becomes profitable, the Company
    will be obligated to reimburse Bayer out of the Company’s
    share of the collaboration profits for 50% of the agreed upon
    development expenses that Bayer has incurred in accordance with
    a formula based on the amount of development expenses that Bayer
    has incurred and the Company’s share of the collaboration
    profits, or at a faster rate at the Company’s option.
    Within the United States, the Company is responsible for any
    future commercialization of the VEGF Trap-Eye and has retained
    exclusive rights to any future profits arising therefrom.

Agreed upon development expenses incurred by both companies,
    beginning in 2007, under a global development plan will be
    shared as follows:

2007:

Up to $50.0 million shared equally; the Company is solely
    responsible for up to the next $40.0 million; over
    $90.0 million shared equally.

2008:

Up to $70.0 million shared equally, the Company is solely
    responsible for up to the next $30.0 million; over
    $100.0 million shared equally.

2009 and thereafter:

All expenses shared equally.

F-23


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

Neither party will be reimbursed for any development expenses
    that it incurred prior to 2007.

Regeneron is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
    supply clinical and commercial product requirements.

Bayer has the right to terminate the Bayer Agreement without
    cause with at least six months or twelve months advance notice
    depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination.
    In the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, the
    Company retains all rights to the VEGF Trap-Eye.

Revenue related to the Bayer Agreement will be recognized in
    accordance with SAB 104 and EITF

00-21

(see
    Note 2). The $75.0 million up-front payment received
    in October 2006 was deferred upon receipt. When the Company and
    Bayer have formalized their projected global development plans
    for the VEGF Trap-Eye, as well as the projected responsibilities
    of each of the companies under such development plans, the
    Company will begin recognizing contract research and development
    revenue related to payments from Bayer. At December 31,
    2006, there were no amounts receivable from Bayer, and deferred
    revenue was $75.0 million.

c.  Novartis
    Pharma AG

In March 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement (the “Novartis Agreement”) with Novartis
    Pharma AG to jointly develop and commercialize the
    Company’s Interleukin-1 Cytokine Trap (“IL-1
    Trap”). In connection with this agreement, Novartis made a
    non-refundable up-front payment  to the Company of
    $27.0 million.

Development expenses incurred during 2003 were shared equally by
    the Company and Novartis. Regeneron funded its share of 2003
    development expenses through a loan (the “2003 Loan”)
    from Novartis, which bore interest at a rate per annum equal to
    the LIBOR rate plus 2.5%, compounded quarterly. As of
    December 31, 2003, the 2003 Loan balance due Novartis,
    including accrued interest, totaled $13.8 million. In March
    2004, Novartis forgave the 2003 Loan and accrued interest
    thereon, totaling $17.8 million, based on Regeneron’s
    achieving a pre-defined development milestone.

In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not
    to proceed with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap. In March
    2004, Novartis agreed to pay the Company $42.75 million to
    satisfy its obligation to fund development costs for the IL-1
    Trap for the nine month period following its notification and
    for the two months prior to that notice. The Company recorded
    the $42.75 million as other contract income in 2004.
    Regeneron and Novartis each retain rights under the
    collaboration agreement to elect to collaborate in the future on
    the development and commercialization of certain other IL-1
    antagonists.

In 2004, the Company recognized contract research and
    development revenue of $22.1 million in connection with the
    Novartis Agreement, which represented the remaining amount of
    the $27.0 million up-front payment from Novartis that had
    previously been deferred. In addition, forgiveness of the 2003
    Loan and accrued interest in 2004 was recognized as a research
    progress payment.

d.  The
    Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, the Company entered into a long-term collaboration
    with The Procter & Gamble Company to discover, develop,
    and commercialize pharmaceutical products, and
    Procter & Gamble agreed to provide funding for
    Regeneron’s research efforts related to the collaboration.
    Effective December 31, 2000, in accordance with the
    companies’ collaboration agreement (the “P&G
    Agreement”), Procter & Gamble was obligated to
    fund Regeneron research on therapeutic areas that were of
    particular interest to Procter & Gamble through
    December 2005, with no further research obligations by either
    party thereafter. Under the P&G Agreement, research support
    from Procter & Gamble was $2.5 million per
    quarter, plus adjustments for inflation, through December 2005.

    share data)

In June 2005, the Company and Procter & Gamble amended
    the P&G Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the modified
    agreement, the Company and Procter & Gamble agreed that
    the research activities of the parties under the P&G
    Agreement were completed on June 30, 2005, six months prior
    to the December 31, 2005 expiration date in the P&G
    Agreement. In connection with the amendment, Procter &
    Gamble made a one-time $5.6 million payment to Regeneron
    and the Company paid approximately $1.0 million to
    Procter & Gamble to acquire certain capital equipment
    owned by Procter & Gamble and located at the
    Company’s facilities. Procter & Gamble and the
    Company divided rights to research programs and pre-clinical
    product candidates that were developed during the research term
    of the P&G Agreement. Neither party has the right to
    participate in the development or commercialization of the other
    party’s product candidates. The Company is entitled to
    receive royalties based on any future product sales of a
    Procter & Gamble pre-clinical candidate arising from
    the collaboration, and Procter & Gamble is entitled to
    receive a small royalty on any sales of a single Regeneron
    candidate that is currently not being developed. Neither party
    is entitled to receive royalties or other payments based on any
    other products arising from the collaboration.

Contract research and development revenue related to the
    Company’s collaboration with Procter & Gamble was
    $6.0 million and $10.5 million in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. In addition, the one-time $5.6 million
    payment made by Procter & Gamble to the Company in
    connection with the amendment to the P&G Agreement was
    recognized as other contract income in 2005.

e.  Serono,
    S.A.

In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement (the
    “Serono Agreement”) with Serono S.A. to use
    Regeneron’s proprietary
    VelociGene

®

technology platform to provide Serono with knock-out and
    transgenic mammalian models of gene function
    (“Materials”). Serono made an advance payment of
    $1.5 million (the “Retainer”) to Regeneron in
    December 2002, which was accounted for as deferred revenue.
    Regeneron recognizes revenue and reduces the Retainer as
    Materials are shipped to and accepted by Serono. The Serono
    Agreement contains provisions for minimum yearly order
    quantities and replenishment of the Retainer when the balance
    declines below a specified threshold. In 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    the Company recognized $1.8 million, $2.2 million, and
    $2.1 million, respectively, of contract research and
    development revenue in connection with the Serono Agreement.

f.  National
    Institutes of Health

In September 2006, the Company was awarded a grant from the
    National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) as part of the
    NIH’s Knockout Mouse Project. The NIH grant provides a
    minimum of $17.9 million in funding over a five-year
    period, subject to compliance with its terms and annual funding
    approvals, for the Company’s use of its VelociGene
    technology to generate a collection of targeting vectors and
    targeted mouse embryonic stem cells (“ES Cells”) which
    can be used to produce knockout mice. The Company will also
    receive another $1.0 million in funding to optimize certain
    existing technology for use in the Knockout Mouse Project. In
    2006, the Company recognized contract research and development
    revenue of $0.5 million from the NIH Grant.

13.

Manufacturing
    Agreement

During 1995, the Company entered into a long-term manufacturing
    agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., as amended, (the
    “Merck Agreement”) to produce an intermediate (the
    “Intermediate”) for a Merck pediatric vaccine at the
    Company’s Rensselaer, New York facility. The Company
    modified portions of its facility for manufacture of the
    Intermediate and assisted Merck in securing regulatory approval
    for such manufacture in the Company’s facility. The Merck
    Agreement called for the Company to manufacture Intermediate for
    Merck for a specified period of time (the “Production
    Period”), with certain minimum order quantities each year.
    The Production Period commenced in

F-25


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

November of 1999 and originally extended for six years. In
    February 2005, the Company and Merck amended the Merck Agreement
    to extend the Production Period through October 2006, at which
    time the Merck Agreement terminated.

Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the capital costs to
    modify the facility (“Capital Costs”). Merck also
    agreed to pay an annual facility fee (the “Facility
    Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning March 1995, subject to
    annual adjustment for inflation. During the Production Period,
    Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for certain manufacturing
    costs, pay the Company a variable fee based on the quantity of
    Intermediate supplied to Merck, and make additional bi-annual
    payments (“Additional Payments”), as defined. In
    addition, Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the cost of
    Company activities performed on behalf of Merck prior to the
    Production Period and for miscellaneous costs during the
    Production Period (“Internal Costs”). These payments
    were recognized as contract manufacturing revenue as follows:
    (i) payments for Internal Costs were recognized as the
    activities were performed, (ii) the Facility Fee and
    Additional Payments were recognized over the period to which
    they related, (iii) payments for Capital Costs were
    deferred and recognized as Intermediate was shipped to Merck,
    and (iv) payments related to the manufacture of
    Intermediate during the Production Period (“Manufacturing
    Payments”) were recognized after the Intermediate was
    tested and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to,
    Merck.

In 2006, 2005, and 2004, Merck contract manufacturing revenue
    totaled $12.3 million, $13.7 million, and
    $18.1 million, respectively. Such amounts include
    $1.2 million, $1.4 million, and $3.6 million of
    previously deferred Capital Costs, respectively.

14.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plans

During 2000, the Company established the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2000
    Incentive Plan”) which, as amended, provides for the
    issuance of up to 18,500,000 shares of Common Stock in
    respect of awards. In addition, shares of Common Stock
    previously approved by shareholders for issuance under the
    Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan
    (“1990 Incentive Plan”) that are not issued under the
    1990 Incentive Plan, may be issued as awards under the 2000
    Incentive Plan. Employees of the Company, including officers,
    and nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members
    of the Company’s board of directors, (collectively,
    “Participants”) may receive awards as determined by a
    committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The
    awards that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include:
    (a) Incentive Stock Options (“ISOs”) and
    Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
    (c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and
    (e) Other Awards.

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right to purchase
    shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the Committee;
    however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise price will
    not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common
    Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest over a
    period of time determined by the Committee, generally on a pro
    rata basis over a three to five year period. The Committee also
    determines the expiration date of each Option; however, no ISO
    is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares of restricted
    Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase such shares at a
    price determined by the Committee. Such shares are
    nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee
    (“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as
    defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the
    Restricted Stock, which has not vested, will be transferred to
    the Company, except under defined circumstances with Committee
    approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the
    Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company
    requires a return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the
    right to require a return of all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the right to
    receive, within 30 days of the date on which the share
    vests, an amount, in cash

and/or

shares of the Company’s Common Stock as determined by the
    Committee,

F-26


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

equal to the sum of the fair market value of a share of Common
    Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests and the
    aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to a share
    of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of the
    share of Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests.
    Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock
    which are granted at the discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are valued based on
    the Company’s Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of
    the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions of such Other
    Awards are determined solely on the authority of the Committee.

During 1990, the Company established the 1990 Incentive Plan
    which, as amended, provided for a maximum of
    6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of awards.
    Employees of the Company, including officers, and nonemployees,
    including consultants and nonemployee members of the
    Company’s board of directors, received awards as determined
    by a committee of independent directors. Under the provisions of
    the 1990 Incentive Plan, there will be no future awards from the
    plan. Awards under the 1990 Incentive Plan consisted of
    Incentive Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock Options which
    generally vest on a pro rata basis over a three or five year
    period and have a term of ten years.

The 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans contain provisions that allow
    for the Committee to provide for the immediate vesting of awards
    upon a change in control of the Company, as defined.

As of December 31, 2006, there were 4,132,249 shares
    available for future grants under the 2000 Incentive Plan.

Non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense recognized in
    operating expenses is provided in Note 2. As of
    December 31, 2006, there was $44.0 million of
    stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding nonvested
    stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, which had not yet
    been recognized in operating expenses. The Company expects to
    recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period
    of 1.9 years. In addition, there are 723,092 options which
    are unvested as of December 31, 2006 and would become
    vested upon the attainment of certain performance and service
    conditions. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant
    date, related to these performance options totals
    $2.7 million and will begin to be recognized only if, and
    when, these options’ performance condition is considered to
    be probable of attainment.

Fair
    value Assumptions:

The fair value of each option granted under the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Incentive Plan during 2006, 2005, and
    2004 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. Using this model, fair value is calculated
    based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected
    volatility of the Company’s Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of the Company’s board of directors are expected to hold
    their options prior to exercise (expected lives),
    (iii) expected dividend yield on the Company’s Common
    Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based
    on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with
    maturities approximating the options’ expected lives.
    Expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements
    in the Company’s stock price over the most recent
    historical periods equivalent to the options’ expected
    lives. Expected lives are principally based on the
    Company’s limited historical exercise experience with
    option grants with similar exercise prices. The expected
    dividend yield is zero as the Company has never paid dividends
    and does not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable
    future. The following table summarizes the weighted average
    values of the assumptions used in computing the fair value of
    option grants during 2006, 2005, and 2004.

    Stock Option Exchange:

In December 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved a
    stock option exchange program. Under the program, Company
    regular employees who work an average of 20 hours per week,
    other than the Company’s chairman and the Company’s
    president and chief executive officer, were provided the
    opportunity to make a one-time election to surrender options
    granted under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans that had an
    exercise price of at least $18.00 and exchange them for
    replacement options granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan in
    accordance with the following exchange ratios:

Exchange Ratio

(Number of Eligible

Options to be

Surrendered and

Cancelled for Each

$18.00 to $28.00

1.50

$28.01 to $37.00

2.00

$37.01 and up

3.00

Participation in the stock option exchange program was
    voluntary, and non-employee directors, consultants, former
    employees, and retirees were not eligible to participate. The
    participation deadline for the program was January 5, 2005.
    Eligible employees elected to exchange options with a total of
    3,665,819 underlying shares of Common Stock, and the Company
    issued 1,977,840 replacement options with an exercise price of
    $8.50 per share on January 5, 2005.

Each replacement option was completely unvested upon grant. Each
    replacement option granted to an employee other than our
    executive vice president and senior vice presidents will
    ordinarily become vested and exercisable with respect to
    one-fourth of the shares initially underlying such option on
    each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the
    grant date so that such replacement option will be fully vested
    and exercisable four years after it was granted. Each
    replacement option granted to our executive vice president and
    senior vice presidents will ordinarily vest with respect to all
    shares underlying such option if both (i) the
    Company’s products have achieved gross sales of at least
    $100 million during any consecutive twelve month period
    (either directly by the Company or through its licenses) and
    (ii) the specific executive or senior vice president has
    remained employed by the Company for at least three years from
    the date of grant. For all replacement options, the
    recipient’s vesting and exercise rights are contingent upon
    the recipients continued employment through the applicable
    vesting date and subject to the other terms of the 2000
    Incentive Plan and the applicable option award agreement. As is
    generally the case with respect to the option award agreements
    for options that were eligible for exchange pursuant to the
    stock option exchange program, the option award agreements for
    replacement options include provisions whereby the replacement
    options may be fully vested in connection with a “Change in
    Control” of the Company, as defined in the 2000 Incentive
    Plan.

Under the stock option exchange program, each replacement option
    has a term equal to the greater of (i) the remaining term
    of the surrendered option it replaces and (ii) six years
    from the date of grant of the replacement option. This was
    intended to ensure that the employees who participated in the
    stock option exchange program would not derive any additional
    benefit from an extended option term unless the surrendered
    option had a remaining term of less than six years.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the
    Company recorded unearned compensation in Stockholders’
    Equity related to grants of Restricted Stock awards. This amount
    was based on the fair market value of shares of the
    Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and was
    expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the period that the
    restriction on these shares lapsed, which was approximately two
    years for grants issued in 2003 and 18 months for grants
    issued in 2004. In addition, unearned compensation in
    Stockholders’ Equity was reduced due to forfeitures of
    Restricted Stock resulting from employee terminations. Prior to
    the adoption of SFAS 123R, unearned compensation was
    included as a separate component of Stockholders’ Equity.
    Effective January 1, 2006, unearned compensation was
    combined with additional paid-in capital in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123R.

In connection with grants of Restricted Stock awards, the
    Company recorded unearned compensation in Stockholders’
    Equity of $1.0 million in 2004 and in connection with
    forfeitures of these awards, the Company reduced unearned
    compensation by $17 thousand, $0.1 million, and
    $0.3 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The
    Company recognized non-cash compensation expense from Restricted
    Stock awards of $0.3 million, $1.9 million, and
    $2.5 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2006, there were no unvested shares of
    restricted stock outstanding and all compensation expense
    related to these awards had been recognized.

15.

Executive
    Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock Purchase Plan
    (the “Plan”) under which 1,027,500 shares of
    Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock awards.
    The Plan provides for the compensation committee of the board of
    directors to award employees, directors, consultants, and other
    individuals (“Plan participants”) who render service
    to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock at a
    price set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides for
    the vesting of shares as determined by the compensation
    committee and, should the Company’s relationship with a
    Plan participant terminate before all shares are vested,
    unvested shares will be repurchased by the Company at a price
    per share equal to the original amount paid by the Plan
    participant. During

1989 and 1990, a total of 983,254 shares were issued, all
    of which vested as of December 31, 1999. As of
    December 31, 2006, there were 44,246 shares available
    for future grants under the Plan.

16.

Employee
    Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Savings
    Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide for employees
    who have met defined service requirements to participate in the
    Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the Savings Plan a
    percentage of their compensation to be set aside to pay their
    future retirement benefits, as defined. The Savings Plan, as
    amended and restated, provides for the Company to make
    discretionary contributions (“Contribution”), as
    defined. The Company recorded Contribution expense of
    $1.3 million in 2006, $2.0 million in 2005, and
    $0.8 million in 2004; such amounts were accrued as
    liabilities at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively. During the first quarter of 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    the Company contributed, 64,532, 120,960, and
    90,385 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings
    Plan in satisfaction of these obligations.

17.

Income
    Taxes

In 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company recognized a net operating
    loss for tax purposes and, accordingly, no provision for income
    taxes has been recorded in the accompanying financial
    statements. There is no benefit for federal or state income
    taxes for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004
    since the Company has incurred net operating losses for tax
    purposes since inception and established a valuation allowance
    equal to the total deferred tax asset.

The tax effect of temporary differences, net operating loss
    carry-forwards, and research and experimental tax credit
    carry-forwards as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
    as follows:

The Company’s valuation allowance increased by
    $44.9 million in 2006, due primarily to increases in the
    Company’s net operating loss carry-forward and the
    temporary difference related to deferred revenue, principally
    resulting from the non-refundable up-front payment received from
    Bayer HealthCare in 2006 (see Note 12b). The Company’s
    valuation allowance increased by $40.5 million in 2005, due
    primarily to an increase in the Company’s net operating
    loss carry-forward, and decreased by $14.2 million in 2004,
    due primarily to a reduction in the temporary difference related
    to deferred revenue.

For all years presented, the Company’s effective income tax
    rate is zero. The difference between the Company’s
    effective income tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 34%
    is attributable to state tax benefits and tax credit
    carry-forwards offset by an increase in the deferred tax
    valuation allowance.

REGENERON

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had available for tax
    purposes unused net operating loss carry-forwards of
    $446.1 million, which will expire in various years from
    2007 to 2026 and included $3.0 million of net operating loss
    carry-forwards related to exercises of Nonqualified Stock
    Options and disqualifying dispositions of Incentive Stock
    Options, the tax benefit from which, if realized, will be
    credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company’s
    research and experimental tax credit carry-forwards expire in
    various years from 2007 to 2026. Under the Internal Revenue Code
    and similar state provisions, substantial changes in the
    Company’s ownership have resulted in an annual limitation
    on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit
    carry-forwards that can be utilized in future years to offset
    future taxable income. This annual limitation may result in the
    expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards
    before utilization.

18.

Legal
    Matters

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings
    in the course of the Company’s business. The Company does
    not expect any such current legal proceedings to have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business or financial
    condition.

19.

Net
    Income (Loss) Per Share

The Company’s basic net income (loss) per share amounts
    have been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
    average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding.
    The diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted
    average number of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock
    outstanding, and of the common stock equivalents outstanding
    when dilutive. In 2006 and 2005, the Company reported net
    losses; therefore, no common stock equivalents were included in
    the computation of diluted net loss per share since such
    inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of
    basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:

Segment
    Information

Through 2006, the Company’s operations were managed in two
    business segments: research and development, and contract
    manufacturing. Due to the expiration of the Company’s
    manufacturing agreement with Merck in October 2006, beginning in
    2007, the Company only has a research and development business
    segment.

Research and development:

Includes all
    activities related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products
    for the treatment of serious medical conditions, and the
    development and commercialization of these discoveries. Also
    includes revenues and expenses related to (i) the
    development of manufacturing processes prior to commencing
    commercial production of a product under contract manufacturing
    arrangements and (ii) the supply of specified, ordered
    research materials using Regeneron-developed proprietary
    technology (see Note 12).

Contract manufacturing:

Includes all revenues
    and expenses related to the commercial production of products
    under contract manufacturing arrangements. During 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, the Company produced Intermediate under the Merck
    Agreement, which expired in October 2006 (see Note 13).

Subsequent
    Event — License Agreement

On February 5, 2007, the Company entered into a
    non-exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca that will allow
    AstraZeneca to utilize the Company’s
    VelocImmune

®

technology in its internal research programs to discover
    human monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement,
    AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million non-refundable up-front
    payment to the Company. AstraZeneca also will make up to five
    additional annual payments of $20.0 million, subject to its
    ability to terminate the agreement after making the first three
    additional payments or earlier if the technology does not meet
    minimum performance criteria. The Company is entitled to receive
    a mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of antibody
    products discovered by AstraZeneca using the Company’s
    VelocImmune technology.
