    programs, the timing and nature of the clinical and research
    programs now underway or planned, and the future sources and
    uses of capital and our financial needs. These statements are
    made by us based on management’s current beliefs and
    judgment. In evaluating such statements, stockholders and
    potential investors should specifically consider the various
    factors identified under the caption “Risk Factors”
    which could cause actual events or results to differ materially
    from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. We do
    not undertake any obligation to update publicly any
    forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
    information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by
    law.

General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company
    that discovers, develops, and intends to commercialize
    pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical
    conditions. We are currently focused on three clinical
    development programs: VEGF Trap in oncology, VEGF Trap eye
    formulation (VEGF Trap-Eye) in eye diseases using intraocular
    delivery, and IL-1 Trap in various systemic inflammatory
    indications. The VEGF Trap oncology development program is being
    developed jointly with the sanofi-aventis Group under a
    September 2003 collaboration agreement. Our preclinical research
    programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis,
    ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases
    and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and
    cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases. We expect that our
    next generation of product candidates will be based on our
    proprietary technologies for developing Traps and Human
    Monoclonal Antibodies. Developing and commercializing new
    medicines entails significant risk and expense. Since inception
    we have not generated any sales or profits from the
    commercialization of any of our product candidates.

Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in
    basic scientific research and discovery-enabling technology and
    combine that foundation with our manufacturing and clinical
    development capabilities to build a successful, integrated
    biopharmaceutical company. Our efforts have yielded a diverse
    pipeline of product candidates that we believe has the potential
    to address a variety of serious medical conditions. We believe
    that our ability to develop product candidates is enhanced by
    the application of our technology platforms. Our discovery
    platforms are designed to identify specific genes of therapeutic
    interest for a particular disease or cell type and validate
    targets through high-throughput production of mammalian models.
    Our Traps, Human Monoclonal Antibody
    (VelocImmune

tm

),
    and cell line expression technologies may then be utilized to
    design and produce new product candidates directed against the
    disease target. We continue to invest in the development of
    enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to identify,
    develop, and commercialize new product candidates.

Clinical
    Programs:

1.  VEGF
    Trap — Oncology

The VEGF Trap is a protein-based product candidate designed to
    bind all forms of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (called
    VEGF-A, also known as Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF) and
    the related Placental Growth Factor (called PlGF), and prevent
    their interaction with cell surface receptors. VEGF-A (and to a
    less validated degree, PlGF) is required for the growth of new
    blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent
    regulator of vascular permeability and leakage. The VEGF Trap is
    being developed in cancer indications in collaboration with
    sanofi-aventis, as described in the section below entitled
    “Collaboration with the sanofi-aventis Group.”

In September 2005, we announced that we and sanofi-aventis were
    expanding the VEGF Trap oncology program and would initiate
    trials in various cancer indications. The companies have
    initiated a single-agent phase 2 study of the VEGF Trap in
    non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. Two additional phase 2
    single-agent safety/efficacy studies, in advanced ovarian cancer
    and symptomatic malignant ascites, are planned to begin during
    the first quarter of 2006. In 2004, the United States Food and
    Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to the
    VEGF Trap for the treatment of symptomatic malignant ascites.



The companies plan to conduct three trials using the VEGF Trap
    in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens; two of which
    are planned to begin as early as the second half of 2006,
    assuming successful completion of initial safety and
    tolerability studies. Three of these safety and tolerability
    combination studies were initiated in 2005 and two more began in
    the first quarter of 2006. The companies are also working with
    the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapeutics
    Evaluation Program to commence up to ten additional cancer
    trials in 2006.

Cancer is a heterogeneous set of diseases and one of the leading
    causes of death in the developed world. A mutation in any one of
    dozens of normal genes can eventually result in a cell becoming
    cancerous; however, a common feature of cancer cells is that
    they need to obtain nutrients and remove waste products, just as
    normal cells do. The vascular system normally supplies nutrients
    to and removes waste from normal tissues. Cancer cells can use
    the vascular system either by taking over preexisting blood
    vessels or by promoting the growth of new blood vessels (a
    process known as angiogenesis). VEGF is secreted by many tumors
    to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels to support the
    tumor. Countering the effects of VEGF, thereby blocking the
    blood supply to tumors, has been shown to provide therapeutic
    benefits. This approach, of inhibiting angiogenesis as a
    mechanism of action for an oncology medicine, was validated in
    February 2004, when the FDA approved Genentech, Inc.’s VEGF
    inhibitor,
    Avastin

®

.
    Avastin is an antibody product designed to inhibit VEGF and
    interfere with the blood supply to tumors.

Collaboration
    with the sanofi-aventis Group

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
    with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (now a member of the
    sanofi-aventis Group) to collaborate on the development and
    commercialization of the VEGF Trap in all countries other than
    Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap. Sanofi-aventis made a
    non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and
    purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our
    Common Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration
    agreement to exclude from the scope of the collaboration the
    development and commercialization of the VEGF Trap for
    intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with the
    amendment, sanofi-aventis made a one-time payment to us of
    $25.0 million in January 2005, of which 50% is repayable to
    sanofi-aventis following commercialization of the VEGF Trap in
    accordance with the terms of the amendment.

In December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our
    collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the
    companies are collaborating on the development of the VEGF Trap
    to include Japan. In connection with this amendment,
    sanofi-aventis agreed to make a $25.0 million
    non-refundable up-front payment to us, which was received in
    January 2006. We may also receive up to $40.0 million in
    milestone payments upon receipt of marketing approvals in Japan
    and a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of the VEGF
    Trap in Japan, subject to certain potential adjustments.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and
    sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
    sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap outside of Japan, for disease
    indications included in our collaboration. We may also receive
    up to $400.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
    receipt of specified marketing approvals, including up to
    $360.0 million in milestone payments for up to eight VEGF
    Trap indications in the United States or the European Union. In
    December 2004, we earned a $25.0 million payment from
    sanofi-aventis, which was received in January 2005, upon the
    achievement of an early-stage clinical milestone.

Regeneron has agreed to continue to manufacture clinical
    supplies of the VEGF Trap at our plant in Rensselaer, New York.
    Sanofi-aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing
    commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the VEGF Trap.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon
    worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during
    the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If
    the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses,
    including 50% of the $25.0 million payment received in
    connection with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration
    agreement, in accordance with a formula based on the amount of
    development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits
    and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. Since
    inception of the collaboration through December 31, 2005,
    we and sanofi-aventis have incurred $130.5 million in
    agreed upon development



expenses related to the VEGF Trap program. In addition, if the
    first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product for intraocular
    delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale of a VEGF
    Trap product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin
    reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of VEGF
    Trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the
    first commercial VEGF Trap sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap
    development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
    rights to the VEGF Trap.

2.  VEGF
    Trap — Eye Diseases

We are developing the VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of certain
    eye diseases. This product candidate has been purified and
    formulated in concentrations suitable for direct injection into
    the eye. We retain the exclusive right to develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of eye
    diseases utilizing local (intravitreal) delivery to the eye.

In February 2006, we announced positive preliminary results from
    an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in patients with the neovascular form of age-related
    macular degeneration (wet AMD). The phase 1 trial is a
    two-part, dose-escalating study designed to assess the safety
    and tolerability of the VEGF Trap-Eye in patients with wet AMD.
    In part A of this trial, patients received a single dose of
    the VEGF Trap-Eye delivered by intravitreal injection into the
    eye, after which they are evaluated for three months to measure
    the durability of effects and provide guidance for dosing
    regimens to be used in future trials. A total of
    21 patients received a single dose of VEGF Trap-Eye at
    doses up to 4 milligrams (mg) intravitreally. All dose
    levels were generally well tolerated, and a maximum tolerated
    dose was not reached in the study. Clinical  investigators at a
    scientific conference recently reported positive preliminary
    results of this study at doses up to 2 mg. The
    investigators reported that patients receiving the VEGF Trap-Eye
    demonstrated rapid, substantial, and prolonged (up to four
    weeks) reductions in retinal thickness, a clinical measure of
    disease activity in wet AMD. Although dosing has been completed,
    patients in this trial are still being evaluated to measure the
    durability of drug effect (as measured by optical coherence
    tomography) pursuant to the study protocol.

In February 2006, we initiated part B of the phase 1
    trial. In this part of the trial, we plan to evaluate the safety
    and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye compared with
    Macugen

®

(Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), an approved treatment for wet
    AMD. We plan to initiate a phase 2 trial of the VEGF
    Trap-Eye delivered intravitreally in patients with wet AMD in
    the first half of 2006.

VEGF-A both stimulates angiogenesis and increases vascular
    permeability. It has been shown in preclinical studies to be a
    major pathogenic factor in both wet AMD and Diabetic
    Retinopathy, and it is believed to be involved in other medical
    problems affecting the eyes. In clinical trials, blocking VEGF-A
    has been shown to be effective in patients with wet AMD, and
    Macugen has been approved to treat patients with this condition.

Wet AMD and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) are two of the leading
    causes of adult blindness in the developed world. In both
    conditions, severe visual loss is caused by a combination of
    retinal edema and neovascular proliferation. It is estimated
    that, in the U.S., 6% of individuals aged 65-74 and 20% of those
    older than 75 are affected with wet AMD. DR is a major
    complication of diabetes mellitus that can lead to significant
    vision impairment. DR is characterized, in part, by vascular
    leakage, which results in the collection of fluid in the retina.
    When the macula, the central area that is responsible for fine
    visual acuity, is involved, loss of visual acuity occurs. This
    is referred to as Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). DME is the most
    prevalent cause of moderate visual loss in patients with
    diabetes.

3.  IL-1
    Trap — Inflammatory Diseases

The IL-1 Trap is a protein-based product candidate designed to
    bind the interleukin-1 (called IL-1) cytokine and prevent its
    interaction with cell surface receptors.

We are evaluating the IL-1 Trap in a number of diseases and
    disorders where IL-1 may play an important role, including
    diseases associated with inflammation. These diseases include
    Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA), Polymyalgia
    Rheumatica (PMR), certain inflammatory vascular diseases, and a
    spectrum of rare diseases called

CIAS

1-Associated
    Periodic Syndrome (CAPS).



In the fourth quarter of 2005, we initiated a pivotal study of
    the IL-1 Trap in patients with CAPS. This study will include a
    six-month, placebo-controlled efficacy phase, followed by a
    six-month open-label extension phase. We plan to complete the
    efficacy phase of this trial by the end of 2006. In December
    2004, the FDA granted orphan drug status to the IL-1 Trap for
    the treatment of CAPS.

We currently have underway

proof-of-concept

trials of the IL-1 Trap in patients with SJIA and PMR. In April
    2005, the FDA granted orphan drug status to the IL-1 Trap for
    the treatment of SJIA. Following successful completion of these
    trials, we may initiate additional trials for these indications.

An IL-1 receptor antagonist,
    Kineret

®

(Amgen Inc.), has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
    rheumatoid arthritis. It has been publicly reported that in
    small trials,
    Kineret

®

appears to reduce the symptoms in CAPS patients and SJIA
    patients, which supports the role of IL-1 in these diseases.
    CAPS includes rare genetic disorders, such as Familial Cold
    Auto-Inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Muckle Wells Syndrome, and
    Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder (NOMID), which
    affect a small group of people. Patients with these disorders
    develop fever, joint aches, headaches, and rashes. In certain
    indications, these symptoms can be extremely serious. There are
    no currently approved therapies for CAPS. SJIA is a severe
    inflammatory disorder, which may be debilitating or fatal. It is
    estimated that there are between 5,000 and 10,000 children with
    SJIA in the United States.

Research
    Technologies:

One way that a cell communicates with other cells is by
    releasing specific signaling proteins, either locally or into
    the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct functions, and are
    classified into different “families” of molecules,
    such as peptide hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. All of
    these secreted (or signaling) proteins travel to and are
    recognized by another set of proteins, called
    “receptors,” which reside on the surface of responding
    cells. These secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and
    biological processes, causing diverse effects ranging from the
    regulation of growth of particular cell types, to inflammation
    mediated by white blood cells. Secreted proteins can at times be
    overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases. In these
    disease settings, blocking the action of secreted proteins can
    have clinical benefit.

Regeneron scientists have developed two different technologies
    to design protein therapeutics to block the action of specific
    secreted proteins. The first technology, termed the
    “Trap” technology, was used to generate our current
    clinical pipeline, including the VEGF Trap, the VEGF Trap-Eye,
    and the IL-1 Trap. These novel “Traps” are composed of
    fusions between two distinct receptor components and the
    constant region of an antibody molecule called the “Fc
    region”, resulting in high affinity product candidates. Our
    new technology for designing protein therapeutics focuses on the
    production of fully human monoclonal antibodies. With the global
    market for approved monoclonal antibody therapeutics exceeding
    $11 billion, there is a growing demand for monoclonal
    antibody technologies to help turn genomic discoveries into
    product candidates. We call our technology
    VelocImmune

tm

and, as described below, believe that it is a unique way of
    generating a wide variety of high affinity therapeutic, human
    monoclonal antibodies.

VelocImmune

tm

(Human Monoclonal Antibodies)

We have developed a novel mouse technology platform, called
    VelocImmune, for producing fully human monoclonal antibodies.
    The VelocImmune mouse platform was generated by exploiting our
    VelociGene technology platform (see below), in a process in
    which several megabases of mouse immune gene loci were replaced
    or “humanized” with corresponding human immune gene
    loci. The VelocImmune mice can be used to efficiently generate
    fully human monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic
    interest. VelocImmune and our related technologies offer the
    potential to increase the speed and efficiency through which
    human monoclonal antibody therapeutics may be discovered and
    validated, thereby improving the overall efficiency of our early
    stage drug development activities. We are utilizing the
    VelocImmune technology to produce our next generation of drug
    candidates for preclinical development and are exploring the
    possibility of entering into licensing or collaborative
    arrangements with third parties related to VelocImmune and
    related technologies.



VelociGene

tm

and
    VelociMouse

tm

(Target Validation)

Our VelociGene platform allows custom and precise manipulation
    of very large sequences of DNA to produce highly customized
    alterations of a specified target gene and accelerates the
    production of knock-out and transgenic expression models without
    using either positive/negative selection or isogenic DNA. In
    producing knock-out models, a color or fluorescent marker is
    substituted in place of the actual gene sequence, allowing for
    high-resolution visualization of precisely where the gene is
    active in the body, during normal body functioning, as well as
    in disease processes. For the optimization of preclinical
    development and toxicology programs, VelociGene offers the
    opportunity to humanize targets by replacing the mouse gene with
    the human homolog. Thus, VelociGene allows scientists to rapidly
    identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or
    over-expressing the target gene, as well as to characterize and
    test potential therapeutic molecules.

The VelociMouse technology also allows for the direct and
    immediate generation of genetically altered mice from
    ES cells, avoiding the lengthy process involved in
    generating and breeding knock-out mice from chimeras. Mice
    generated through this method are normal and healthy and exhibit
    a 100% germ-line transmission frequency. Furthermore,
    Regeneron’s Velocimice are suitable for direct phenotyping
    or other studies.

Cell
    Line Expression Technologies

Many proteins that are of potential pharmaceutical value are
    proteins which are “secreted” from the cells into the
    bloodstream. Examples of secreted proteins include growth
    factors (such as insulin and growth hormone) and antibodies.
    Current technologies for the isolation of cells engineered to
    produce high levels of secreted proteins are both laborious and
    time consuming. We have developed enabling platforms for the
    high-throughput, rapid generation of high-producing cell lines
    for our Traps and VelocImmune Human Monoclonal Antibodies.

Research
    Programs

:

Oncology
    and Angiogenesis

In many clinical settings, positively or negatively regulating
    blood vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits,
    as could the repair of damaged and leaky vessels. Vascular
    Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) was the first growth factor
    shown to be specific for blood vessels, by virtue of having its
    receptor specifically expressed on blood vessel cells. In 1994,
    we discovered a second family of angiogenic growth factors,
    termed the Angiopoietins, and we have received patents covering
    members of this family. The Angiopoietins include naturally
    occurring positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis, as
    described in numerous scientific manuscripts published by our
    scientists and their collaborators. The Angiopoietins are being
    evaluated in preclinical research by us and our academic
    collaborators. Our preclinical studies have revealed that VEGF
    and the Angiopoietins normally function in a coordinated and
    collaborative manner during blood vessel growth. In terms of
    blocking vessel growth, manipulation of both VEGF and
    Angiopoietins seems to be of value. We have research programs
    focusing on several targets in the areas of oncology and
    angiogenesis.

Metabolic
    and Related Diseases

Food intake and metabolism are regulated by complex interactions
    between diverse neural and hormonal signals that serve to
    maintain an optimal balance between energy intake, storage, and
    utilization. The hypothalamus, a small area at the base of the
    brain, is critically involved in the integration of peripheral
    signals which reflect nutritional status and neural outputs
    which regulate appetite, food seeking behaviors, and energy
    expenditure. Metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes,
    reflect a dysregulation in the systems which ordinarily tightly
    couple energy intake to energy expenditure. Our preclinical
    research program in this area encompasses the study of
    peripheral (hormonal) regulators of food intake and metabolism
    in health and disease. We have identified several targets in
    these therapeutic areas and are evaluating potential antibodies
    to evaluate in preclinical studies.

Muscle
    Diseases and Disorders

Muscle atrophy occurs in many neuromuscular diseases and also
    when muscle is unused, as often occurs during prolonged hospital
    stays and during convalescence. Currently, physicians have few
    options to treat subjects



with muscle atrophy or other muscle conditions which afflict
    millions of people globally. Thus, a treatment that has
    beneficial effects on skeletal muscle could have significant
    clinical benefit. Our muscle research program is currently
    focused on conducting in vivo and in vitro experiments with
    the objective of demonstrating and further understanding the
    molecular pathways involved in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy,
    and discovering therapeutic candidates that can modulate these
    pathways. We have several molecules in late stage research and
    are evaluating them for possible further development.

Other
    Therapeutic Areas

We have research programs focusing on inflammatory and immune
    diseases, pain, bone and cartilage, ophthalmology, and
    cardiovascular diseases.

Manufacturing

In 1993, we purchased our 104,000 square foot Rensselaer,
    New York manufacturing facility, and in 2003 completed a
    19,500 square foot expansion. This facility is used to
    manufacture therapeutic candidates for our own preclinical and
    clinical studies. We also use the facility to manufacture a
    product for Merck & Co., Inc. under a contract that
    expires in October 2006. In July 2002, we leased
    75,000 square feet in a building near our Rensselaer
    facility which is being used for the manufacture of Traps and
    for warehouse space. At December 31, 2005, we employed 230
    people at these owned and leased manufacturing facilities. There
    were no impairment losses associated with long-lived assets at
    these facilities as of December 31, 2005.

In 1995, we entered into a long-term manufacturing agreement
    with Merck (called, as amended, the Merck Agreement) to produce
    an intermediate for a Merck pediatric vaccine at our Rensselaer
    facility. In February 2005, we and Merck extended the Merck
    Agreement through October 2006. Merck pays us an annual facility
    fee of $1.0 million (plus annual adjustments for
    inflation), reimburses us for certain manufacturing costs, pays
    us a variable fee based on the quantity of intermediate supplied
    to Merck, subject to certain minimum order quantities each year,
    and makes certain additional payments. We recognized contract
    manufacturing revenue related to the Merck Agreement of
    $13.7 million in 2005, $18.1 million in 2004, and
    $10.1 million in 2003.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a
    medicine is the requirement that the prospective
    manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
    conform to the GMP regulations of the health authority. In
    complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
    manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in
    the area of production and quality control to ensure full
    technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign
    and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the
    authority of the FDA and by other national, federal, state, and
    local agencies. If our manufacturing facilities fail to comply
    with FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be required
    to suspend manufacturing. This will have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and
    cash flow.

Competition

There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and
    pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
    and chemical companies (see “Risk
    Factors —

Even if our product candidates are
    ever approved, their commercial success is highly uncertain
    because our competitors may get to the marketplace before we do
    with better or lower cost drugs or the market for our product
    candidates may be too small to support commercialization or
    sufficient profitability

.”). Our competitors may
    include Genentech, Novartis Pharma AG, Pfizer Inc., Eyetech
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now part of OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.),
    the Bayer Group, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Abbott
    Laboratories, sanofi-aventis, Merck, Amgen, Roche, and others.
    Many of our competitors have substantially greater research,
    preclinical, and clinical product development and manufacturing
    capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than
    we do. Our smaller competitors may also be significant if they
    acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
    arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
    if we achieve product commercialization, one or more of our
    competitors may achieve product commercialization earlier than
    we do or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely
    affects our activities. Our ability to compete will depend on
    how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates,
    complete clinical testing and approval processes, and supply
    commercial quantities of the product to the market. Competition
    among



product candidates approved for sale will also be based on
    efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent
    position, and other factors.

VEGF Trap and VEGF Trap-Eye.

Many companies
    are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block the
    actions of VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A
    variety of approaches have been employed, including antibodies
    to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF receptor, small molecule
    antagonists to the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, and other
    anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of these alternative
    approaches may offer competitive advantages to our VEGF Trap in
    efficacy, side-effect profile, or method of delivery.
    Additionally, some of these molecules are either already
    approved for marketing or are at a more advanced stage of
    development than our product candidate.

In particular, in February 2004, Genentech was granted approval
    by the FDA to market and sell
    Avastin

®

(Genentech), a monoclonal antibody to VEGF in patients with
    colorectal cancer. The marketing approvals for Avastin and
    Genentech’s extensive, ongoing clinical development plans
    for Avastin, make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in
    clinical trials to support the VEGF Trap oncology program. This
    may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap. Other companies are developing
    small molecule inhibitors to VEGF tyrosine kinases in different
    cancer settings.

We face significant competition in our VEGF Trap-Eye programs.
    For example, Eyetech Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer are marketing an
    approved VEGF inhibitor for the treatment of wet AMD. Genentech
    and Novartis have completed phase 3 development of a VEGF
    antibody fragment in wet AMD and have submitted a marketing
    application for their product candidate in this indication. In
    addition, it has been reported that ophthalmologists are
    successfully using a third-party reformulated version of
    Genentech’s approved VEGF antagonist, Avastin, for the
    treatment of wet AMD. These competing VEGF blockers make it more
    difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials for the
    VEGF Trap-Eye in these indications and may delay or impair our
    ability to successfully develop and commercialize the VEGF
    Trap-Eye in eye diseases.

IL-1 Trap.

The availability of highly
    effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists such as
    Enbrel

®

(Amgen),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret (Amgen), and
    other marketed therapies makes it difficult to successfully
    develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap. Even if the
    IL-1 Trap is ever approved for sale, it will be difficult
    for our drug to compete against these FDA approved
    TNF-antagonists because doctors and patients will have
    significant experience using these effective medicines.
    Moreover, there are both small molecules and antibodies in
    development by third parties that are designed to block the
    synthesis of interleukin-1 or inhibit the signaling of
    interleukin-1. For example, Novartis is developing an antibody
    to interleukin-1 and Amgen is developing an antibody to the
    interleukin-1 receptor. These drug candidates could offer
    competitive advantages over the IL-1 Trap. The successful
    development of these competing molecules could delay or impair
    our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the IL-1
    Trap.

Other Areas.

Many pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies are attempting to discover new
    therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time
    and resources. In these and related areas, intellectual property
    rights have been sought and certain rights have been granted to
    competitors and potential competitors of ours, and we may be at
    a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result
    of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained
    personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic
    competitors are involved in the discovery and development of
    novel therapeutics that are the focus of other research or
    development programs we are now conducting. These competitors
    include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many others. Many firms
    and entities are engaged in research and development in the
    areas of cytokines, interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle
    conditions. Some of these competitors are currently conducting
    advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these
    areas. These and other competitors may have established
    substantial intellectual property and other competitive
    advantages.

If a competitor announces a successful clinical study involving
    a product that may be competitive with one of our product
    candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory
    agency for a competitive product, the announcement may have an
    adverse effect on our operations or future prospects or on the
    market price of our common stock.



We also compete with academic institutions, governmental
    agencies, and other public or private research organizations,
    which conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish
    collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of
    products that would provide royalties or other consideration for
    use of their technology. These institutions are becoming more
    active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements
    to collect royalties or other consideration for use of the
    technology that they have developed. Products developed in this
    manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also
    compete with others in acquiring technology from these
    institutions, agencies, and organizations.

Patents,
    Trademarks, and Trade Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents,
    maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing
    on the proprietary rights of third parties (see “Risk
    Factors —

We may be restricted in our
    development

and/or

commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage
    awards if we are found to have infringed, third party patents or
    other proprietary rights.”).

Our policy is to file
    patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and
    improvements that we consider important to our business and
    operations. We are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of
    additional U.S. patents and patent applications. We also
    rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological
    innovation in an effort to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We or our licensors or collaborators have filed patent
    applications on various products and processes relating to our
    product candidates as well as other technologies and inventions
    in the United States and in certain foreign countries. We intend
    to file additional patent applications, when appropriate,
    relating to improvements in these technologies and other
    specific products and processes. We plan to aggressively
    prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents and other proprietary
    technology.

Patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in
    the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are
    subject to this additional uncertainty. Others may independently
    develop similar products or processes to those developed by us,
    duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are
    issued to us, design around any products and processes covered
    by our patents. We expect to continue, when appropriate, to file
    product and process patent applications with respect to our
    inventions. However, we may not file any such applications or,
    if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or
    licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of
    others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can
    be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is
    favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued to or
    licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may
    find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third
    parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the
    development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into
    account patent rights of third parties.

Government
    Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the United States and
    foreign countries is a significant factor in the research,
    development, manufacture, and marketing of our product
    candidates (see “Risk Factors —

If we do
    not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we
    will not be able to market or sell
    them.”).

All of our product candidates will
    require regulatory approval before they can be commercialized.
    In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to
    rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-market
    approval requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many
    aspects of the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign
    pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during
    recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a
    number of jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome and impact of such
    reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted.

The activities required before a product candidate may be
    marketed in the United States begin with preclinical tests.
    Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal
    studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the
    product candidate and its formulations. The results of these
    studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an
    Investigational New Drug Application, which must be reviewed by
    the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically,
    clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In
    phase 1, trials are conducted with a small number of
    subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product
    candidate. In phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with
    subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to
    provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety,



tolerability, and efficacy of different potential doses of the
    product candidate. In phase 3, large-scale clinical trials
    are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific disease
    or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand the
    efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as
    required by the FDA. The results of the preclinical and clinical
    testing of a biologic product candidate are then submitted to
    the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application, or BLA,
    for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be
    approved for commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA
    may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or
    deny the application.

Any approval required by the FDA for any of our product
    candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The
    designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase
    is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be
    sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and
    a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase
    notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a
    particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or early
    stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or
    efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more
    broadly in humans.

Approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory
    authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to
    commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The
    approval procedure varies among countries and may involve
    additional testing, and the time required to obtain such
    approval may differ from that required for FDA approval.

Various federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations
    also govern or influence the research, manufacture, safety,
    labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport, or
    other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates. The lengthy
    process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with
    applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of
    substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or
    licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory
    approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing
    of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty
    revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and future business
    will be subject to regulation under the United States Atomic
    Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances
    Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
    national restrictions, and other current and potential future
    local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Business
    Segments

Our operations are managed in two business segments: research
    and development, and contract manufacturing. The research and
    development segment includes all activities related to the
    discovery of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of
    serious medical conditions, and the development and
    commercialization of these discoveries. It also includes
    revenues and expenses related to (i) the development of
    manufacturing processes prior to commencing commercial
    production of a product under contract manufacturing
    arrangements and (ii) the supply of specified, ordered
    research materials using Regeneron-developed proprietary
    technology. The contract manufacturing segment includes all
    revenues and expenses related to the commercial production of
    products under contract manufacturing arrangements. During 2005,
    2004, and 2003, the Company produced an intermediate under the
    Merck Agreement, as described under “Manufacturing”
    above. For financial information about these segments, see
    Note 19, “Segment Information”, beginning on

page F-33

in our Financial Statements.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we had 588 full-time
    employees, of whom 87 held a Ph.D. or M.D. degree or both. We
    believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and
    experienced personnel in a highly competitive environment;
    however, competition for these personnel is intense. None of our
    personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and
    our management considers its relations with our employees to be
    good.



Available
    Information

We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy
    statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    or the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials
    that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference
    Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. The
    public may obtain information on the operation of the Public
    Reference Room by calling the SEC at

1-800-SEC-0330.

Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains
    reports, proxy and information statements, and other information
    regarding issuers, including Regeneron, that file electronically
    with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file
    with the SEC at

    Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we
    electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the
    SEC.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We operate in an environment that involves a number of
    significant risks and uncertainties. We caution you to read the
    following risk factors, which have affected,

and/or

in
    the future could affect, our business, operating results,
    financial condition, and cash flows. The risks described below
    include forward-looking statements, and actual events and our
    actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in
    these forward-looking statements. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
    Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties are described
    under other captions in this report and should be considered by
    our investors.

Risks
    Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Additional
    Financing

We
    have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve
    profitability. If we continue to incur operating losses, we may
    be unable to continue our operations.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
    2005, we had a cumulative loss of $585.3 million. If we
    continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a
    profitable company, we may be unable to continue our operations.
    We have no products that are available for sale and do not know
    when we will have products available for sale, if ever. In the
    absence of revenue from the sale of products or other sources,
    the amount, timing, nature or source of which cannot be
    predicted, our losses will continue as we conduct our research
    and development activities. We currently receive contract
    manufacturing revenue from our agreement with Merck and, until
    June 30, 2005, we received contract research and
    development revenue from our agreement with The
    Procter & Gamble Company. Our agreement with
    Procter & Gamble expired in June 2005 and our agreement
    with Merck will expire before the end of 2006. The expiration of
    these agreements results in a significant loss of revenue to the
    Company.

We
    will need additional funding in the future, which may not be
    available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce or
    eliminate our product development programs or commercialization
    efforts.

We will need to expend substantial resources for research and
    development, including costs associated with clinical testing of
    our product candidates. We believe our existing capital
    resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at
    least mid-2008; however, our projected revenue may decrease or
    our expenses may increase and that would lead to our capital
    being consumed significantly before such time. We will likely
    require additional financing in the future and we may not be
    able to raise such additional funds. If we are able to obtain
    additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible
    debt securities, such sales may be dilutive to our shareholders.
    Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain
    assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business
    activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may
    contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders.
    If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the
    development of our product candidates, we may face delay,
    reduction or elimination of our research and development
    programs or preclinical or clinical trials, in which case our
    business, financial condition or results of operations may be
    materially harmed.



We
    have a significant amount of debt and may have insufficient cash
    to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations. In
    addition, the amount of our debt could impede our operations and
    flexibility.

We have a significant amount of convertible debt and semi-annual
    interest payment obligations. This debt, unless converted to
    shares of our common stock, will mature in October 2008. We may
    be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain
    funds necessary to make required payments on our debt. Even if
    we are able to meet our debt service obligations, the amount of
    debt we already have could hurt our ability to obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes. In
    addition, our debt obligations could require us to use a
    substantial portion of cash to pay principal and interest on our
    debt, instead of applying those funds to other purposes, such as
    research and development, working capital, and capital
    expenditures.

We
    have adopted, effective January 1, 2005, the fair market
    value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
    compensation. This will materially increase operating expenses
    in our Statement of Operations, primarily due to non-cash
    compensation costs related to stock options.

We have adopted, effective January 1, 2005, the fair value
    based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
    under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. (SFAS) 123,

Accounting for Stock Based
    Compensation

, using the modified prospective method as
    described in SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.

As
    a result, effective January 1, 2005, we have been
    recognizing expense in an amount equal to the fair value of
    share-based payments (including stock option awards) on their
    date of grant over the vesting period of the awards. In 2005,
    non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense of
    $19.9 million related to stock options awards was
    recognized in operating expenses in our Statement of Operations,
    which increased our basic and diluted net loss per share. Also,
    if we had adopted SFAS 123 effective January 1, 2004,
    our net income for the full year 2004 would have decreased by
    approximately $33.6 million and our basic and diluted net
    income per share in 2004 would have been $0.15 per share
    instead of $0.75 per share (basic) and $0.74 per share
    (diluted).

In addition, in December 2004, the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board issued SFAS 123R,

Share-Based
    Payment

, which is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes
    Accounting Principles Board No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees.

SFAS 123R requires the recognition
    of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of
    share-based payments (including stock options) issued to
    employees. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R effective for
    the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006. The impact of
    adopting SFAS 123R has not yet been quantified.

The negative impact on our income (loss) as a result of adopting
    SFAS 123 as of January 1, 2005, and subsequently
    adopting SFAS 123R commencing January 1, 2006, may
    negatively affect our stock price.

Risks
    Related to Development of Our Product Candidates

Successful
    development of any of our product candidates is highly
    uncertain.

Only a small minority of all research and development programs
    ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We have
    never developed a drug that has been approved for marketing and
    sale, and we may never succeed in developing an approved drug.
    Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness of
    any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the
    necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial
    success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their
    acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party
    payers and on our partners’ ability to successfully
    manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Our
    product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion
    or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are
    generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule
    delivery. If our products are not successfully commercialized,
    we will not be able to recover the significant investment we
    have made in developing such products and our business would be
    severely harmed.

We intend to study our lead product candidates, the VEGF Trap,
    VEGF Trap-Eye, and IL-1 Trap, in a wide variety of indications.
    We intend to study the VEGF Trap in a variety of cancer
    settings, the VEGF Trap-Eye in different eye diseases and
    ophthalmologic indications, and the IL-1 Trap in a variety of
    systemic inflammatory



disorders. Most of these current trials are exploratory studies
    designed to identify what diseases and uses, if any, are best
    suited for our product candidates. It is likely that our product
    candidates will not demonstrate the requisite efficacy

and/or

safety profile to support continued development for most of the
    indications that are to be studied. In fact, our product
    candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and safety
    profile to support the continued development for any of the
    indications or uses.

Clinical
    trials required for our product candidates are expensive and
    time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. If any of
    our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results, we
    will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory
    approval for our product candidates.

We must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates
    before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell
    them. We need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and
    human clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a lengthy,
    time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and trials
    may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including,
    among others, failure of the product candidate to demonstrate
    safety or efficacy, the development of serious or
    life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or
    connected with exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in
    enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial, lack
    of sufficient supplies of the product candidate, and the failure
    of clinical investigators, trial monitors and other consultants,
    or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol. A
    clinical trial may fail because it did not include a sufficient
    number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or
    reach statistical significance. A clinical trial may also fail
    because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in the
    trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal
    effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting. For
    example, we are studying higher doses of the IL-1 Trap in
    different diseases after a phase 2 trial using lower doses
    of the IL-1 Trap in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis failed to
    achieve its primary endpoint.

We will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test
    favorably and either conduct new trials, which are expensive and
    time consuming, or abandon the drug development program. Even if
    we obtain positive results from preclinical or clinical trials,
    we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Many
    companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including us, have
    suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after
    promising results have been obtained in earlier trials. The
    failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and
    effectiveness for the desired indication(s) could harm the
    development of the product candidate(s), and our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations may be materially
    harmed.

The
    development of serious or life-threatening side effects with any
    of our product candidates would lead to delay or discontinuation
    of development, which could severely harm our
    business.

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes
    in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts,
    to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine
    whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these
    conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have
    been reported from

time-to-time

during clinical trials of our product candidates. Although our
    current drug candidates appeared to be generally well tolerated
    in clinical trials conducted to date, it is possible as we test
    any of them in larger, longer, and more extensive clinical
    programs, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were
    observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not
    occur or went undetected in smaller previous trials, will be
    reported by patients. Many times, side effects are only
    detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large
    scale, phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after
    they are made available to patients after approval. If
    additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product
    candidates has many side effects or causes serious or
    life-threatening side effects, the development of the product
    candidate may fail or be delayed, which would severely harm our
    business.

Our VEGF Trap is being studied for the potential treatment of
    certain types of cancer and our VEGF Trap-Eye candidate is being
    studied in diseases of the eye. There are many potential safety
    concerns associated with significant blockade of vascular
    endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. These risks, based on the
    clinical and preclinical experience of systemically delivered
    VEGF inhibitors, including the systemic delivery of the VEGF
    Trap, include bleeding, hypertension, and proteinuria. These
    serious side effects and other serious side effects have been
    reported in our systemic VEGF Trap studies in cancer and
    diseases of the eye. In addition, patients given infusions of
    any protein, including the VEGF Trap delivered through
    intravenous administration, may develop severe hypersensitivity
    reactions, referred to as infusion reactions. These and other
    complications or side effects



could harm the development of the VEGF Trap for the treatment of
    cancer or the VEGF Trap-Eye for the treatment of diseases of the
    eye.

Although the IL-1 Trap was generally well tolerated and was not
    associated with any drug-related serious adverse events in the
    phase 2 rheumatoid arthritis study completed in 2003,
    safety or tolerability concerns may arise as we test higher
    doses of the IL-1 Trap in patients with other inflammatory
    diseases and disorders. Like

TNF-antagonists

such as
    Enbrel

®

(Amgen)
    and
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), the IL-1 Trap affects the immune defense system of
    the body by blocking some of its functions. Therefore, there may
    be an increased risk for infections to develop in patients
    treated with the IL-1 Trap. In addition, patients given
    infusions of the IL-1 Trap have developed hypersensitivity
    reactions, referred to as infusion reactions. These and other
    complications or side effects could harm the development of the
    IL-1 Trap.

Our
    product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that
    could cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of
    harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic
    protein.

In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and
    regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the
    administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an
    immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against
    the therapeutic protein. The antibodies can have no effect or
    can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or
    require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic
    effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react with the
    patient’s own proteins, resulting in an
    “auto-immune” type disease. Whether antibodies will be
    created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical
    experiments, and their appearance is often delayed, so that
    there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not
    be created at a later date — in some cases even
    after pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Subjects who
    received the IL-1 Trap in clinical trials have developed
    antibodies. It is possible that as we test the VEGF Trap with
    more sensitive assays in different patient populations and
    larger clinical trials, we will find that subjects given the
    VEGF Trap develop antibodies to the product candidate.

We may
    be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in
    a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial
    use.

Changes in product formulations and manufacturing processes may
    be required as product candidates progress in clinical
    development and are ultimately commercialized. If we are unable
    to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing
    processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product
    candidates, including the VEGF Trap, VEGF Trap-Eye, IL-1 Trap,
    and IL-4/13 Trap, we may be unable to supply necessary materials
    for our clinical trials, which would delay the development of
    our product candidates. Similarly, if we are unable to supply
    sufficient quantities of our product or develop product
    formulations suitable for commercial use, we will not be able to
    successfully commercialize our product candidates.

Risks
    Related to Intellectual Property

If we
    cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our
    patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our
    business and competitive position will be harmed.

Our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology
    and other information that we protect as trade secrets. We seek
    to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through
    confidentiality agreements. If our trade secrets are improperly
    exposed, either by our own employees or our collaborators, it
    would help our competitors and adversely affect our business. We
    will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized
    use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are
    covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
    maintained as trade secrets. The patent position of
    biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual
    questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted
    with certainty. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated, or
    circumvented. Patent applications filed outside the United
    States may be challenged by third parties who file an
    opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly common
    in the European Union and are costly to defend. We have patent
    applications that are being opposed and it is likely that we
    will need to defend additional patent applications in the
    future. Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary
    position or



competitive advantages against competitors. Furthermore, even if
    the outcome is favorable to us, the enforcement of our
    intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time
    consuming.

We may
    be restricted in our development

and/or

commercialization activities by, and could be subject to damage
    awards if we are found to have infringed, third party patents or
    other proprietary rights.

Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to
    operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary
    rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that they have
    blocking patents to our products in clinical development, either
    because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition
    of a product or the way it is manufactured or used.

We are aware of patents and pending applications owned by
    Genentech that claim certain chimeric VEGF receptor
    compositions. Although we do not believe that the VEGF Trap or
    VEGF Trap-Eye infringes any valid claim in these patents or
    patent applications, Genentech could initiate a lawsuit for
    patent infringement and assert its patents are valid and cover
    the VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap-Eye. Genentech may be motivated to
    initiate such a lawsuit at some point in an effort to impair our
    ability to develop and sell the VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap-Eye,
    which represents a potential competitive threat to
    Genentech’s VEGF-binding products and product candidates.
    An adverse determination by a court in any such potential patent
    litigation would likely materially harm our business by
    requiring us to seek a license, which may not be available, or
    resulting in our inability to manufacture, develop and sell the
    VEGF Trap or VEGF Trap-Eye or in a damage award.

We are aware of certain United States and foreign patents
    relating to particular IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. Our IL-4/13
    Trap includes portions of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. In
    addition, we are aware of a broad patent held by Genentech
    relating to proteins fused to certain immunoglobulin domains.
    Our Trap product candidates include proteins fused to
    immunoglobulin domains. Although we do not believe that we are
    infringing valid and enforceable third party patents, the
    holders of these patents may sue us for infringement and a court
    may find that we are infringing one or more validly issued
    patents, which may materially harm our business.

Any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent
    us from manufacturing, selling, or developing our drug
    candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly
    issued patents of third parties. In the event that the
    manufacture, use, or sale of any of our clinical candidates
    infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of
    third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product
    development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our drugs
    and may be required to pay costly damages. Such a result may
    materially harm our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations. Legal disputes are likely to be costly and time
    consuming to defend.

We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment,
    such licenses are needed. If any licenses are required, we may
    not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable
    terms, if at all. The failure to obtain any such license could
    prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of
    our product candidates, which could severely harm our business.

Regulatory
    and Litigation Risks

If we
    do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we
    will not be able to market or sell them.

We cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval.
    If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our
    product candidates, the value of our company and our results of
    operations will be harmed. In the United States, we must obtain
    and maintain approval from the United States Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) for each drug we intend to sell. Obtaining
    FDA approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process, and
    approval is highly uncertain. Foreign governments also regulate
    drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country
    is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is
    highly uncertain. None of our product candidates has ever
    received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the
    United States or any other country. We may never receive
    regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.



If the
    testing or use of our products harms people, we could be subject
    to costly and damaging product liability claims. We could also
    face costly and damaging claims arising from employment law,
    securities law, environmental law, or other applicable laws
    governing our operations.

The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use
    in people expose us to product liability risk. Any informed
    consent or waivers obtained from people who sign up for our
    clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of
    litigation. Our product liability insurance may not cover all
    potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability
    arising from any such litigation. Moreover, we may not have
    access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our
    insurance on acceptable terms.

Our
    operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to
    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. We may
    incur substantial liability arising from our activities
    involving the use of hazardous materials.

As a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing
    operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health,
    and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the
    use of hazardous materials. Our research and development and
    manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of
    chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous
    materials. The cost of compliance with environmental, health,
    and safety regulations is substantial. If an accident involving
    these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we
    could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face
    regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or
    insurance coverage.

Changes
    in the securities laws and regulations have increased, and are
    likely to continue to increase, our costs.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which became law in July 2002,
    has required changes in some of our corporate governance,
    securities disclosure, and compliance practices. In response to
    the requirements of that Act, the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock
    Market have promulgated new rules and listing standards covering
    a variety of subjects. Compliance with these new rules and
    listing standards has increased our legal costs, and
    significantly increased our accounting and auditing costs, and
    we expect these costs to continue. These developments may make
    it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain
    directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
    Likewise, these developments may make it more difficult for us
    to attract and retain qualified members of our board of
    directors, particularly independent directors, or qualified
    executive officers.

In
    future years, if we or our independent registered public
    accounting firm are unable to conclude that our internal control
    over financial reporting is effective, the market value of our
    common stock could be adversely affected.

As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to
    include a report of management on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting in their annual reports on

Form 10-K

that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness
    of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition,
    the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our
    financial statements must attest to and report on
    management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting. Our independent
    registered public accounting firm provided us with an
    unqualified report as to our assessment and the effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005, which report is included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2005. However, we cannot
    assure you that management or our independent registered public
    accounting firm will be able to provide such an assessment or
    unqualified report as of future year-ends. In this event,
    investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our
    financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the
    market value of our common stock.



Risks
    Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties

If our
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis for the VEGF Trap is
    terminated, our business operations and our ability to develop,
    manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap in the time
    expected, or at all, would be harmed.

We rely heavily on sanofi-aventis to assist with the development
    of the VEGF Trap oncology program. Sanofi-aventis funds all of
    the development expenses incurred by both companies in
    connection with the VEGF Trap oncology program. If the VEGF Trap
    oncology program continues, we will rely on sanofi-aventis to
    assist with funding the VEGF Trap program, provide commercial
    manufacturing capacity, enroll and monitor clinical trials,
    obtain regulatory approval, particularly outside the United
    States, and provide sales and marketing support. While we cannot
    assure you that the VEGF Trap will ever be successfully
    developed and commercialized, if sanofi-aventis does not perform
    its obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to
    develop, manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap in cancer
    indications will be significantly adversely affected.
    Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate its collaboration
    agreement with us at any time upon twelve months advance notice.
    If sanofi-aventis were to terminate its collaboration agreement
    with us, we would not have the resources or skills to replace
    those of our partner, which could cause significant delays in
    the development

and/or

manufacture of the VEGF Trap and result in substantial
    additional costs to us. We have no sales, marketing, or
    distribution capabilities and would have to develop or outsource
    these capabilities. Termination of the sanofi-aventis
    collaboration agreement would create substantial new and
    additional risks to the successful development of the VEGF Trap
    oncology program.

Our
    collaborators and service providers may fail to perform
    adequately in their efforts to support the development,
    manufacture, and commercialization of our drug
    candidates.

We depend upon third-party collaborators, including
    sanofi-aventis and service providers such as clinical research
    organizations, outside testing laboratories, clinical
    investigator sites, and third-party manufacturers and product
    packagers and labelers, to assist us in the development of our
    product candidates. If any of our existing collaborators or
    service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us
    or does not perform its development or manufacturing services
    under an agreement in a timely manner or at all, we could
    experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the
    development or ultimate commercialization of our product
    candidates.

Risks
    Related to the Manufacture of Our Product Candidates

We
    have limited manufacturing capacity, which could inhibit our
    ability to successfully develop or commercialize our
    drugs.

Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA
    requires that the facilities at which the product will be
    manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing
    practices, or cGMP requirements. Manufacturing product
    candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is
    complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our
    products must be manufactured for development, following
    approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with
    regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any
    of our product collaborators or third-party manufacturers,
    product packagers, or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory
    compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including,
    among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for
    a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing
    approval. As a result, our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations may be materially harmed.

Our manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce
    sufficient quantities of product for commercial sale. We intend
    to rely on our corporate collaborators, as well as contract
    manufacturers, to produce the large quantities of drug material
    needed for commercialization of our products. We rely entirely
    on third-party manufacturers for filling and finishing services.
    We will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver
    material on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory
    requirements. If we are unable to supply sufficient material on
    acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or
    difficulties in our relationships with our corporate
    collaborators or contract manufacturers, our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.



We may expand our own manufacturing capacity to support
    commercial production of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or
    API, for our product candidates. This will require substantial
    additional funds, and we will need to hire and train significant
    numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our
    facility.

Start-up

costs can be large and

scale-up

entails significant risks related to process development and
    manufacturing yields. We may be unable to develop manufacturing
    facilities that are sufficient to produce drug material for
    clinical trials or commercial use. In addition, we may be unable
    to secure adequate filling and finishing services to support our
    products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations may be materially harmed.

We may be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for
    the manufacture of our product candidates. In addition, we may
    face difficulties in developing or acquiring production
    technology and managerial personnel to manufacture sufficient
    quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in
    compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental
    regulations and governmental permitting requirements.

If any
    of our clinical programs are discontinued, we may face costs
    related to the unused capacity at our manufacturing
    facilities.

We have large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New
    York. Under a long-term manufacturing agreement with Merck,
    which expires in October 2006, we produce an intermediate for a
    Merck pediatric vaccine at our facility in Rensselaer, New York.
    We also use our facilities to produce API for our own clinical
    and preclinical candidates. When we no longer use our facilities
    to manufacture the Merck intermediate or if clinical candidates
    are discontinued, we will have to absorb overhead costs and
    inefficiencies.

Certain
    of our raw materials are single-sourced from third parties;
    third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability
    to supply our products.

Certain raw materials necessary for manufacturing and
    formulation of our product candidates are provided by
    single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. We would be
    unable to obtain these raw materials for an indeterminate period
    of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to
    cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these
    materials or products to us for any reason, including due to
    regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial
    developments at or affecting the supplier, or due to labor
    shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product
    candidates for use in clinical trials, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business and future prospects.

Also, certain of the raw materials required in the manufacturing
    and the formulation of our clinical candidates may be derived
    from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine
    serum, and human serum albumin. There are certain European
    regulatory restrictions on using these biological source
    materials. If we are required to substitute for these sources to
    comply with European regulatory requirements, our clinical
    development activities may be delayed or interrupted.

Risks
    Related to Commercialization of Products

If we
    are unable to establish sales, marketing, and distribution
    capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to do
    so, we will be unable to successfully market and sell future
    products.

We have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities and
    have only a small staff with marketing capabilities. If we are
    unable to obtain those capabilities, either by developing our
    own organizations or entering into agreements with service
    providers, we will not be able to successfully sell any products
    that we may obtain regulatory approval for and bring to market
    in the future. In that event, we will not be able to generate
    significant revenue, even if our product candidates are
    approved. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the
    qualified sales and marketing personnel we need or that we will
    be able to enter into marketing or distribution agreements with
    third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all. Under the
    terms of our collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, we
    currently rely on sanofi-aventis for sales, marketing, and
    distribution of the VEGF Trap in cancer indications, should it
    be approved in the future by regulatory authorities for
    marketing. We will have to rely on a third party or devote
    significant resources to develop our own sales, marketing, and
    distribution capabilities for our other product candidates,
    including the VEGF Trap-Eye, and we may be unsuccessful in
    developing our own sales, marketing, and distribution
    organization.



Even
    if our product candidates are approved for marketing, their
    commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors
    may get to the marketplace before we do with better or lower
    cost drugs or the market for our product candidates may be too
    small to support commercialization or sufficient
    profitability.

There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and
    pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
    and chemical companies. Many of our competitors have
    substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical product
    development and manufacturing capabilities, and financial,
    marketing, and human resources than we do. Our smaller
    competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they
    acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
    arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
    if we achieve product commercialization, our competitors have
    achieved, and may continue to achieve, product commercialization
    before our products are approved for marketing and sale.

Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist,
    Avastin

®

(Genentech),
    on the market for treating certain cancers and many different
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to
    develop competing VEGF antagonists, including Novartis, Eyetech
    Pharmaceuticals, and Pfizer. Many of these molecules are farther
    along in development than the VEGF Trap and may offer
    competitive advantages over our molecule. Novartis has an
    ongoing phase 3 clinical development program evaluating an
    orally delivered VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor in different
    cancer settings. Onyx Pharmaceuticals and Bayer have received
    approval from the FDA to market and sell the first oral
    medication that targets tumor cell growth and new vasculature
    formation that fuels the growth of tumors. The marketing
    approvals for Genentech’s VEGF antagonist, Avastin, and
    their extensive, ongoing clinical development plan for Avastin
    in other cancer indications, may make it more difficult for us
    to enroll patients in clinical trials to support the VEGF Trap
    and to obtain regulatory approval of the VEGF Trap in these
    cancer settings. This may delay or impair our ability to
    successfully develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap. In
    addition, even if the VEGF Trap is ever approved for sale for
    the treatment of certain cancers, it will be difficult for our
    drug to compete against Avastin and the Onyx/Bayer kinase
    inhibitor, because doctors and patients will have significant
    experience using these medicines. In addition, an oral
    medication may be considerably less expensive for patients than
    a biologic medication, providing a competitive advantage to
    companies that market such products.

The market for eye diseases is also very competitive. Eyetech
    Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer are marketing an approved VEGF
    inhibitor for age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).
    Novartis and Genentech are collaborating on the development of a
    VEGF antibody fragment for the treatment of wet AMD that is in
    phase 3 development. In December 2005, Genentech announced
    that it filed an application with the FDA to market and sell
    this VEGF inhibitor in patients with wet AMD. In addition, it
    has been reported that ophthalmologists are using a third-party
    reformulated version of Genentech’s approved VEGF
    antagonist, Avastin with success for the treatment of wet AMD.
    The marketing approval of the Eyetech/Pfizer VEGF inhibitor and
    the potential off-label use of Avastin and approval of the
    Novartis/Genentech VEGF antibody fragment make it more difficult
    for us to successfully develop the VEGF Trap-Eye. Even if the
    VEGF Trap-Eye is ever approved for sale for the treatment of eye
    diseases, it will be difficult for our drug to compete against
    the Eyetech/Pfizer drug and, if approved by the FDA, the
    Novartis/Genentech VEGF inhibitor, because doctors and patients
    will have significant experience using these medicines.
    Moreover, the relatively low cost of therapy with Avastin in
    patients with wet AMD presents a further competitive challenge
    in this indication.

The availability of highly effective FDA approved
    TNF-antagonists such as
    Enbrel

®

(Amgen),
    Remicade

®

(Centocor), and
    Humira

®

(Abbott Laboratories), and the IL-1 receptor antagonist
    Kineret

®

(Amgen), and other marketed therapies makes it more difficult to
    successfully develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap. This is
    one of the reasons we discontinued the development of the IL-1
    Trap in adult rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, even if the
    IL-1 Trap is ever approved for sale, it will be difficult for
    our drug to compete against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists
    in indications where both are useful because doctors and
    patients will have significant experience using these effective
    medicines. Moreover, in such indications these approved
    therapeutics may offer competitive advantages over the IL-1
    Trap, such as requiring fewer injections.

There are both small molecules and antibodies in development by
    third parties that are designed to block the synthesis of
    interleukin-1 or inhibit the signaling of interleukin-1. For
    example, Novartis is developing an antibody to interleukin-1 and
    Amgen is developing an antibody to the interleukin-1 receptor.
    These drug candidates could



offer competitive advantages over the IL-1 Trap. The successful
    development of these competing molecules could delay or impair
    our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the IL-1
    Trap. For example, we may find it difficult to enroll patients
    in clinical trials for the IL-1 Trap if the companies developing
    these competing interleukin-1 inhibitors commence clinical
    trials in the same indications.

We are developing the IL-1 Trap for the treatment of a spectrum
    of rare diseases associated with mutations in the

CIAS

    gene. These rare genetic disorders affect a small group of
    people, estimated to be between several hundred and a few
    thousand. There may be too few patients with these genetic
    disorders to profitably commercialize the IL-1 Trap in this
    indication.

The
    successful commercialization of our product candidates will
    depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these
    products from third-party payers.

Sales of biopharmaceutical products largely depend on the
    reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government
    health care programs and private health insurers. Without the
    financial support of the governments or third-party payers, the
    market for any biopharmaceutical product will be limited. These
    third-party payers increasingly challenge the price and examine
    the cost-effectiveness of products and services. Significant
    uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of any new
    therapeutic, particularly if there exist lower-cost standards of
    care. Third-party payers may not reimburse sales of our
    products, which would harm our business.

Risk
    Related to Employees

We are
    dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and
    retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and
    commercial organizations, our business will be
    harmed.

We are highly dependent on our executive officers. If we are not
    able to retain any of these persons or our Chairman, our
    business may suffer. In particular, we depend on the services of
    P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., the Chairman of our board of
    directors, Leonard Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our
    President and Chief Executive Officer, George D.
    Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice
    President, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron
    Research Laboratories, Murray A. Goldberg, our Senior Vice
    President, Finance & Administration, Chief Financial
    Officer, Treasurer, and Assistant Secretary, Neil
    Stahl, Ph.D., our Senior Vice President, Preclinical
    Development and Biomolecular Science, and Randall G.
    Rupp, Ph.D., our Senior Vice President, Manufacturing
    Operations. There is intense competition in the biotechnology
    industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in
    the development, manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We
    may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified
    personnel necessary for developing our business.

Risks
    Related to Our Common Stock

Our
    stock price is extremely volatile.

There has been significant volatility in our stock price and
    generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies’
    securities. Various factors and events may have a significant
    impact on the market price of our common stock. These factors
    include, by way of example:

•

progress, delays, or adverse results in clinical trials;

•

announcement of technological innovations or product candidates
    by us or competitors;

•

fluctuations in our operating results;

•

public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of our product
    candidates;

•

developments in our relationship with collaborative partners;

•

developments in the biotechnology industry or in government
    regulation of healthcare;

•

large sales of our common stock by our executive officers,
    directors, or significant shareholders;



•

arrivals and departures of key personnel; and

•

general market conditions.

The trading price of our common stock has been, and could
    continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to
    these and other factors, including the sale or attempted sale of
    a large amount of our common stock in the market. Broad market
    fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our
    common stock.

Future
    sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us
    may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise
    funds in new share offerings.

A small number of our shareholders beneficially own a
    substantial amount of our common stock. As of December 31,
    2005, our seven largest shareholders, including sanofi-aventis,
    beneficially owned 47.0% of our outstanding shares of Common
    Stock, assuming, in the case of Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D.
    Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, and P. Roy
    Vagelos, M.D., our Chairman, the conversion of their
    Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of all
    options held by them which are exercisable within 60 days
    of December 31, 2005. As of that date, sanofi-aventis owned
    2,799,552 shares of Common Stock, representing
    approximately 5.2% of the shares of Common Stock then
    outstanding. Under our stock purchase agreement with
    sanofi-aventis, through September 5, 2006, sanofi-aventis
    may sell no more than 250,000 of these shares in any calendar
    quarter. After September 5, 2006, sanofi-aventis may sell
    no more than 500,000 of these shares in any calendar quarter. If
    sanofi-aventis, or our other significant shareholders or we,
    sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public
    market, or the perception that such sales may occur exists, the
    market price of our Common Stock could fall. Sales of Common
    Stock by our significant shareholders, including sanofi-aventis,
    also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by
    selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a
    time and price that we deem appropriate.

Our
    existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence
    over matters requiring shareholder approval.

Holders of Class A Stock, who are generally the
    shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our
    initial public offering, are entitled to ten votes per share,
    while holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per
    share. As of December 31, 2005, holders of Class A
    Stock held 4.2% of all shares of Common Stock and Class A
    Stock then outstanding, and had 30.3% of the combined voting
    power of all of Common Stock and Class A Stock then
    outstanding. These shareholders, if acting together, would be in
    a position to significantly influence the election of our
    directors and to effect or prevent certain corporate
    transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of
    the combined classes, including mergers and other business
    combinations. This may result in our company taking corporate
    actions that you may not consider to be in your best interest
    and may affect the price of our Common Stock. As of
    December 31, 2005:

•

our current officers and directors beneficially owned 14.8% of
    our outstanding shares of Common Stock, assuming conversion of
    their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of
    all options held by such persons which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2005, and 33.6% of the
    combined voting power of our outstanding shares of Common Stock
    and Class A Stock, assuming the exercise of all options
    held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days
    of December 31, 2005; and

•

our seven largest shareholders beneficially owned 47.0% of our
    outstanding shares of Common Stock assuming, in the case of
    Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Executive
    Officer, and P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., our Chairman, the conversion
    of their Class A Stock into Common Stock and the exercise
    of all options held by them which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2005. In addition, these seven
    shareholders held 53.4% of the combined voting power of our
    outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock,
    assuming the exercise of all options held by our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chairman which are exercisable within
    60 days of December 31, 2005.



The
    anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and
    rights agreement, and of New York corporate law, could deter,
    delay, or prevent an acquisition or other “change in
    control” of us and could adversely affect the price of our
    common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our
    by-laws, our rights agreement and the New York Business
    Corporation Law contain various provisions that could have the
    effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our
    company or our management that shareholders may consider
    favorable or beneficial. Some of these provisions could
    discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and
    other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate
    actions. These provisions could also limit the price that
    investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
    our common stock. These provisions include:

•

authorization to issue “blank check” preferred stock,
    which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the
    board of directors without prior shareholder approval, with
    rights senior to those of our common shareholders;

•

a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three
    successive annual meetings to replace all of our directors;

•

a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for
    cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty
    percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for
    directors, as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the
    board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors;

•

any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of
    shareholders may be taken without a meeting, only if, prior to
    such action, all of our shareholders consent, the effect of
    which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at
    a duly convened meeting;

•

any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual
    meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this
    intention in writing and meet various other
    requirements; and

•

under the New York Business Corporation Law, a plan of merger or
    consolidation of the Company must be approved by two-thirds of
    the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.
    See the risk factor immediately above captioned

“Our
    existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence
    over matters requiring shareholder approval.”

We have a shareholder rights plan which could make it more
    difficult for a third party to acquire us without the support of
    our board of directors and principal shareholders. In addition,
    many of our stock options issued under our 2000 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan may become fully vested in connection with a
    “change in control” of the Company, as defined in the
    plan.

Legal
    Proceedings

In May 2003, securities class action lawsuits were commenced
    against Regeneron and certain of our officers and directors in
    the United States District Court for the Southern District of
    New York. A consolidated amended class action complaint was
    filed in October 2003. The complaint, which was purported to be
    brought on behalf of a class consisting of investors in our
    publicly traded securities between March 28, 2000 and
    March 30, 2003, alleged that the defendants misstated or
    omitted material information concerning the safety and efficacy
    of AXOKINE, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
    Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder.

On November 14, 2005, the United States District Court for
    the Southern District of New York approved the terms of a
    settlement between plaintiffs and Regeneron settling all claims
    against us in this lawsuit. The settlement requires no payment
    by us or any of the individual defendants named in the lawsuit.
    Our primary insurance carrier agreed to make the required
    payment under the settlement, the amount of which is immaterial
    to us. The settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing by
    Regeneron or any of the individual defendants. Separately, the
    plaintiffs and the individual defendants named in the lawsuit
    entered into a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, which
    dismissed all claims against the individuals with prejudice.

From time to time, we are a party to other legal proceedings in
    the course of our business. We do not expect any such other
    current legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on
    our business or financial condition.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and
    intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the
    treatment of serious medical conditions. We are currently
    focused on three clinical development programs: VEGF Trap in
    oncology, VEGF Trap-Eye in eye diseases using intraocular
    delivery, and IL-1 Trap in certain systemic inflammatory
    indications. The VEGF Trap oncology development program is being
    developed jointly with the sanofi-aventis Group under a
    September 2003 collaboration agreement. Our preclinical research
    programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis,
    ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases
    and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and
    cartilage, pain, and cardiovascular diseases. We expect that our
    next generation of product candidates will be based on our
    proprietary technologies for developing Traps and Human
    Monoclonal Antibodies.

Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant
    risk and expense. Since inception we have not generated any
    sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
    product candidates and may never receive such revenues. Before
    revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates
    can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a
    number of hurdles which include successfully completing research
    and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA
    and regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, the
    biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving
    and highly competitive, and new developments may render our
    products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
    2005, we had a cumulative loss of $585.3 million. In the
    absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product
    candidates or other sources, the amount, timing, nature, and
    source of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue as
    we conduct our research and development activities. We expect to
    incur substantial losses over the next several years as we
    continue the clinical development of the VEGF Trap-Eye and IL-1
    Trap; advance new product candidates into clinical development
    from our existing research programs; continue our research and
    development programs; and commercialize product candidates that
    receive regulatory approval, if any. Also, our activities may
    expand over time and require additional resources, and we expect
    our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next
    several years. Our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter
    and will depend, among other factors, on the progress of our
    research and development efforts, the timing of certain
    expenses, and the amount and timing of payments that we receive
    from collaborators.

As a company that does not expect to generate product revenues
    or profits over the next several years, management of cash flow
    is extremely important. The most significant use of our cash is
    for research and development activities, which include drug
    discovery, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the
    manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and
    clinical trials. In 2005, our research and development expenses
    totaled $155.6 million. We expect these expenses to
    increase 5-10% in 2006, depending on the progress of our
    clinical programs. The principal sources of cash to-date have
    been sales of common equity and convertible debt and funding
    from our collaborators in the form of up-front payments,
    research progress payments, payments for our research and
    development activities, and purchases of our common stock. We
    also receive payments for contract manufacturing.

A primary driver of our expenses is our number of full-time
    employees. Our annual average headcount in 2005 was 696 compared
    to 721 in 2004 and 675 in 2003. In 2006, we expect our annual
    average headcount to decrease to approximately 600, primarily as
    a result of reductions made in the fourth quarter of 2005 and
    planned for mid-2006. The workforce reductions, which we
    announced in September 2005, are associated with narrowing the
    focus of our research and development efforts, substantial
    improvements in manufacturing productivity, the June 2005
    expiration of our collaboration with Procter & Gamble,
    and the expected completion of contract manufacturing for Merck
    in late 2006.



The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs
    are significant factors that can affect our operating and
    financial results. In our clinical programs, key events in 2005
    and plans for 2006 are as follows:

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
    with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (now a member of the
    sanofi-aventis Group) to collaborate on the development and
    commercialization of the VEGF Trap in all countries other than
    Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap. Sanofi-aventis made a
    non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and
    purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our
    Common Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration
    agreement to exclude rights to develop and commercialize the
    VEGF Trap for intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection
    with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a $25.0 million
    non-refundable payment to us.

In December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our
    collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the
    companies are collaborating on the development of the VEGF Trap
    to include Japan. As a result, the collaboration now includes
    joint development of the VEGF Trap throughout the world in all
    indications, except for intraocular delivery to the eye. In
    connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis agreed to make a
    $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us, which
    was received in January 2006. We may also receive up to
    $40.0 million in milestone payments upon receipt of
    specified marketing approvals for up to five VEGF Trap
    indications in Japan and a royalty of approximately 35% on
    annual sales of the VEGF Trap in Japan, subject to certain
    potential adjustments.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and
    sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
    sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap outside of Japan, for disease
    indications included in our collaboration. We may also receive
    up to $400.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
    receipt of specified marketing approvals, including up to
    $360.0 million in milestone payments for up to eight VEGF
    Trap indications in the United States or the European Union. In
    December 2004, we earned a $25.0 million payment from
    sanofi-aventis, which was received in January 2005, upon the
    achievement of an early-stage clinical milestone.

Regeneron has agreed to continue to manufacture clinical
    supplies of the VEGF Trap at our plant in Rensselaer, New York.
    Sanofi-aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing
    commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the VEGF Trap.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon
    worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during
    the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If
    the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses,
    including 50% of the $25.0 million payment received in
    connection with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration
    agreement, in accordance with a formula based on the amount of
    development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits
    and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. Since
    inception of the collaboration through December 31, 2005,
    we and sanofi-aventis have incurred $130.5 million in
    agreed upon development expenses related to the VEGF Trap
    program. In addition, if the first commercial sale of a VEGF
    Trap product for intraocular delivery to the eye predates the
    first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product under the
    collaboration by



two years, we will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to
    $7.5 million of VEGF Trap development expenses in
    accordance with a formula until the first commercial VEGF Trap
    sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap
    development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
    rights to the VEGF Trap.

Novartis
    Pharma AG

In March 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap.
    Novartis made a non-refundable payment of $27.0 million and
    purchased 7,527,050 newly issued unregistered shares of our
    Common Stock for $48.0 million.

IL-1 Trap development expenses incurred in 2003 were shared
    equally by Regeneron and Novartis. We funded our share of 2003
    development expenses through loans from Novartis. In March 2004,
    Novartis forgave its outstanding loans to us totaling
    $17.8 million, including accrued interest, based on
    Regeneron’s achieving a pre-defined development milestone,
    which was recognized as a research progress payment.

In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not
    to proceed with the joint development of the

IL-1

Trap,
    and subsequently paid us $42.75 million to satisfy its
    obligation to fund development costs for the nine month period
    following its notification and for the two months prior to that
    notice. All rights to the IL-1 Trap have reverted to Regeneron.
    In addition, we recognized contract research and development
    revenue of $22.1 million, which represents the remaining
    amount of the March 2003 up-front payment from Novartis that had
    previously been deferred. Under the collaboration agreement, we
    retain the right to elect to collaborate in the future
    development and commercialization of a Novartis IL-1 antibody,
    which is in clinical development, and Novartis has the right to
    elect to collaborate in the development and commercialization of
    our second generation IL-1 Trap, should we decide to develop
    this product candidate.

The
    Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, we entered into a long-term collaboration agreement
    with Procter & Gamble to discover, develop, and
    commercialize pharmaceutical products. In connection with the
    collaboration, Procter & Gamble agreed to provide
    funding in support of our research efforts related to the
    collaboration. Effective December 31, 2000, we and
    Procter & Gamble entered into a new long-term
    collaboration agreement, replacing the companies’ 1997
    agreement. The new agreement extended Procter &
    Gamble’s obligation to fund our research under the new
    collaboration agreement through December 2005, with no further
    research obligations by either party thereafter. We and
    Procter & Gamble divided rights to the programs from
    the 1997 collaboration agreement that were no longer part of the
    companies’ collaboration. Under the December 2000
    agreement, research support from Procter & Gamble was
    $2.5 million per quarter, plus annual adjustments for
    inflation, through December 2005.

In June 2005, we and Procter & Gamble amended our
    December 2000 collaboration agreement. Under the terms of the
    modified agreement, the two companies agreed that the research
    activities being pursued under the collaboration agreement were
    completed on June 30, 2005, six months prior to the
    December 31, 2005 expiration date in the collaboration
    agreement. Procter & Gamble agreed to make a one-time
    $5.6 million payment to Regeneron, which was received in
    July 2005, and to fund our research under the agreement through
    the second quarter of 2005. We agreed to pay Procter &
    Gamble approximately $1.0 million to acquire certain
    capital equipment owned by Procter & Gamble and located
    at our facilities. We and Procter & Gamble divided
    rights to research programs and preclinical product candidates
    that were developed during the research term of the
    collaboration. Neither party has the right to participate in the
    development or commercialization of the other party’s
    product candidates. We are entitled to receive royalties based
    on any future product sales of a Procter & Gamble
    preclinical candidate arising from the collaboration. Neither
    party is entitled to receive either royalties or other payments
    based on any other products arising from the December 2000
    collaboration agreement.

Accounting
    for Stock-based Employee Compensation

Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value based
    method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. (SFAS) 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
    using the modified prospective method as described in
    SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.

As
    a result, effective January 1, 2005, we have been



recognizing expense, in an amount equal to the fair value of
    share-based payments (including stock option awards) on their
    date of grant, over the vesting period of the awards. Under the
    modified prospective method, we recognize compensation expense
    for (a) all share based payments granted on or after
    January 1, 2005, (including replacement options granted
    under our stock option exchange program which concluded on
    January 5, 2005) and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date. Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, we
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. (APB) 25,

Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations.
    Therefore, compensation expense related to employee stock
    options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period
    prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior period operating
    results have not been restated. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, non-cash stock-based employee
    compensation expense related to stock options awards (Stock
    Option Expense) totaled $20.0 million, of which
    $19.9 million was recognized in operating expenses and
    $0.1 million was capitalized in inventory.

Assumptions

We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
    each option granted under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Using this model, fair value is
    calculated based on assumptions with respect to
    (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of our board of directors are expected to hold their options
    prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend
    yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
    rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
    securities with maturities approximating the options’
    expected lives. Expected volatility, which is re-evaluated at
    least quarterly, has been estimated based on actual movements in
    our stock price over the most recent historical periods
    equivalent to the options’ expected lives. Expected lives
    are principally based on our limited historical exercise
    experience with option grants with similar exercise prices. The
    expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends
    and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable
    future. The following table summarizes the weighted average
    values of the assumptions we used in computing the fair value of
    option grants during 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Changes in any of these estimates may materially affect the fair

    compensation recognized in any period.

Results
    of Operations

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures:

As described above, effective January 1, 2005, Regeneron
    began recognizing Stock Option Expense in accordance with
    SFAS 123 in each of the categories of expense in our
    Statement of Operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123,
    Stock Option Expense was not reflected in operating expenses and
    prior period operating results have not been restated.

The discussion of our results of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 includes certain financial
    measures that are calculated in a manner different from
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are
    considered non-GAAP financial measures under United States
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. These non-GAAP
    financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2005
    are: (1) pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per
    share (basic and diluted), exclusive of Stock Option Expense,
    and (2) research and development expenses, general and
    administrative expenses, and contract manufacturing expenses,
    all exclusive of Stock Option Expense. Our management does not
    intend that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures be
    considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared
    in accordance with GAAP.



Our management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures
    described above present helpful information to investors and
    other users of Regeneron’s financial statements by
    providing greater transparency about the nature of and trends in
    our operating expenses and net income (loss) and a more useful
    basis for comparing our operating results for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004. In addition, Regeneron’s
    management uses non-GAAP financial measures which exclude Stock
    Option Expense internally for operating, budgeting, and
    financial planning purposes. In our discussion below we have
    included tables which provide a reconciliation of the
    differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the
    most directly comparable financial measures calculated and
    presented in accordance with GAAP.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004

Net
    Income (Loss):

Regeneron reported a net loss of $95.4 million, or
    $1.71 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, compared with net income of
    $41.7 million, or $0.75 per basic share and
    $0.74 per diluted share, for 2004. Excluding Stock Option
    Expense, Regeneron had a pro forma net loss of
    $75.5 million, or $1.35 per share (basic and diluted),
    in 2005 as follows:

Our total revenue decreased to $66.2 million in 2005 from
    $174.0 million in 2004, due primarily to lower revenues
    related to our collaboration with sanofi-aventis on the VEGF
    Trap and the absence in the 2005 period of revenues related to
    our collaboration with Novartis on the IL-1 Trap which ended in
    2004. Collaboration revenue earned from sanofi-aventis and
    Novartis is comprised of contract research and development
    revenue and research progress payments. Contract research and
    development revenue, as detailed below, consists partly of
    reimbursement for research and development expenses and partly
    of the recognition of revenue related to non-refundable,
    up-front payments. Non-refundable up-front payments are recorded
    as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over



the period over which we are obligated to perform services in
    accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104) (see Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates).

Sanofi-aventis’ reimbursement of Regeneron VEGF Trap
    expenses decreased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to
    lower clinical supply manufacturing costs in 2005. We
    manufactured clinical supplies of the VEGF Trap throughout 2004,
    but only manufactured VEGF Trap clinical supplies during the
    fourth quarter of 2005. In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis
    provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint
    development of the IL-1 Trap and the remaining balance of the
    $27.0 million up-front payment received from Novartis in
    March 2003 was recognized as contract research and development
    revenue. Since the first quarter of 2004, we have not received,
    and do not expect to receive, any further contract research and
    development revenue from Novartis.

Contract research and development revenue earned from
    Procter & Gamble also decreased in 2005 compared to
    2004, resulting from the June 2005 amendment to our December
    2000 collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble, as
    described above under “Collaborations — The
    Procter & Gamble Company.” Under the terms of the
    modified agreement, Procter & Gamble funded
    Regeneron’s research for the first two quarters of 2005,
    compared with a full year of collaborative research funding in
    2004. We do not expect to receive any further contract research
    and development revenue from Procter & Gamble.

In December 2004, we earned a $25.0 million research
    progress payment from sanofi-aventis, which was received in
    January 2005, upon achievement of an early-stage VEGF Trap
    clinical milestone. In March 2004, Novartis forgave all of its
    outstanding loans, including accrued interest, to Regeneron
    totaling $17.8 million, based upon Regeneron’s
    achieving a pre-defined IL-1 Trap development milestone. These
    amounts were recognized as research progress payments in 2004.

Contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long-term
    agreement with Merck, which expires in October 2006, to
    manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our Rensselaer, New York
    facility. Contract manufacturing revenue decreased to
    $13.7 million in 2005 from $18.1 million in 2004,
    principally due to a decrease in product shipments to Merck in
    2005 compared to 2004. Revenue and the related manufacturing
    expense are recognized as product is shipped, after acceptance
    by Merck. Included in contract manufacturing revenue in 2005 and
    2004 are $1.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively,
    of deferred revenue associated with capital improvement
    reimbursements paid by Merck prior to commencement of
    production. This deferred revenue is being recognized as product
    is shipped to Merck based on the total amount of product
    expected to be shipped over the term of the agreement. In
    February 2005, we agreed to extend the manufacturing agreement
    by one year through October 2006. As a result, in 2005 we began
    recognizing the remaining deferred balance of Merck’s
    capital improvement reimbursements as of December 31, 2004,
    which totaled $2.7 million, as revenue as product is
    shipped to Merck, based upon Merck’s order quantities
    through October 2006.



Expenses:

Total operating expenses increased to $190.6 million in
    2005 from $168.4 million in 2004. Operating expenses in
    2005 include a total of $19.9 million of Stock Option
    Expense, as follows:

In addition, $0.1 million of Stock Option Expense was
    capitalized into inventory, for a total of $20.0 million of
    Stock Option Expense recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Stock Option Expense was not included in
    operating expenses in 2004, as reported in our Statement of
    Operations. In 2004, had we adopted the fair value based method
    of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under the
    provisions of SFAS 123, Stock Option Expense would have
    totaled $33.6 million. The decrease in total Stock Option
    Expense of $13.6 million in 2005 was partly due to lower
    exercise prices of annual employee option grants made by us in
    December 2004 in comparison to the exercise prices of annual
    grants in recent prior years. Exercise prices of these option
    grants were generally equal to the fair market value of our
    Common Stock on the date of grant. The decrease in Stock Option
    Expense in 2005 was also due, in part, to the exchange of
    options by eligible employees in connection with our stock
    option exchange program in January 2005, as the unamortized fair
    value of the surrendered options on the date of the exchange is
    being recognized as Stock Option Expense over a longer time
    period (the vesting period of the replacement options) in
    accordance with SFAS 123.

Research
    and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses, exclusive of Stock Option
    Expense, increased to $143.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 from $136.1 million for 2004. The
    following table summarizes the major categories of our research
    and development expenses for the years ended December 31,

(2)

In 2004, research and development expenses as reported in our
    Statement of Operations did not include Stock Option Expense.



Payroll and benefits, exclusive of Stock Option Expense,
    increased $4.7 million in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to
    2005 wage and salary increases, higher employee benefit costs,
    and severance costs (totaling $2.2 million in
    2005) associated with our workforce reduction plan that we
    initiated in October 2005. Clinical trial expenses increased
    $7.9 million in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to higher IL-1
    Trap costs associated with commencing clinical studies in new
    indications and discontinuing the Phase 2b study in adult
    rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical manufacturing costs, exclusive of
    Stock Option Expense, decreased $3.8 million in 2005 from
    2004, as lower costs in 2005 related to manufacturing clinical
    supplies of the VEGF Trap and the IL-4/13 Trap were partly
    offset by higher costs related to manufacturing clinical
    supplies of the IL-1 Trap. Research and preclinical development
    costs decreased $2.4 million in 2005 from 2004, due
    primarily to lower VEGF Trap preclinical development costs and
    lower costs for general research supplies in 2005. Occupancy and
    other operating costs increased by $1.2 million in 2005
    from 2004, due primarily to higher costs for utilities, taxes,
    and operating expenses associated with our leased research
    facilities in Tarrytown, New York.

Contract
    Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses, exclusive of Stock Option
    Expense, decreased to $9.2 million in 2005, compared to
    $15.2 million in 2004, primarily because we shipped less
    product to Merck in 2005 and we incurred unfavorable
    manufacturing costs in 2004, which were expensed in the period
    incurred.

General
    and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses, exclusive of Stock Option
    Expense, increased to $17.8 million in 2005 from
    $17.1 million in 2004, as 2005 administrative wage and
    salary increases, higher employee benefits costs and higher
    administrative facility costs were partly offset by
    (i) lower legal expenses related to Company litigation and
    general corporate matters and (ii) lower professional fees,
    principally associated with accounting and other services
    related to our first year of compliance in 2004 with the
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002.

Other
    Income and Expense:

In June 2005, we and Procter & Gamble amended our
    collaboration agreement and agreed that the research activities
    of both companies under the collaboration agreement were
    completed. In connection with the amendment, Procter &
    Gamble made a one-time $5.6 million payment to us, which we
    recognized as other contract income in 2005. In January 2005, we
    and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to
    exclude rights to develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap for
    intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with the
    amendment, sanofi-aventis made a one-time $25.0 million
    payment to us, which we recognized as other contract income in
    2005. In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis notified us of its
    decision to forgo its right under the collaboration to jointly
    develop the IL-1 Trap and subsequently paid us
    $42.75 million to satisfy its obligation to fund
    development costs for the IL-1 Trap for the nine-month period
    following its notification and for the two months prior to that
    notice. The $42.75 million was included in other contract
    income in 2004.

Investment income increased to $10.4 million in 2005 from
    $5.5 million in 2004, due primarily to higher effective
    interest rates on investment securities in 2005. Interest
    expense decreased slightly to $12.0 million in 2005 from
    $12.2 million in 2004. Interest expense is attributable
    primarily to $200.0 million of convertible notes issued in
    October 2001, which mature in 2008 and bear interest at
    5.5% per annum.

Our total revenue increased to $174.0 million in 2004 from
    $57.5 million in 2003, due primarily to higher revenues
    related to our collaboration with sanofi-aventis on the VEGF
    Trap and our prior collaboration with Novartis on the IL-1 Trap.
    Collaboration revenue earned from sanofi-aventis and Novartis is
    comprised of contract research and development revenue and
    research progress payments. Contract research and development
    revenue, as detailed below, consists partly of reimbursement for
    research and development expenses and partly of the recognition
    of revenue related to non-refundable, up-front payments.
    Non-refundable up-front payments are recorded as deferred
    revenue and recognized ratably over the period over which we are
    obligated to perform services in accordance with SAB 104
    (see Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
    Estimates). In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis provided
    notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint
    development of the IL-1 Trap and the $22.1 million
    remaining balance of the $27.0 million up-front payment
    received from Novartis in March 2003 was recognized as contract
    research and development revenue.

Sanofi-aventis and Novartis contract research &

In December 2004, we earned a $25.0 million research
    progress payment from sanofi-aventis, which was received in
    January 2005, upon achievement of an early-stage VEGF Trap
    clinical milestone. In March 2004, Novartis forgave all its
    outstanding loans, including accrued interest, to Regeneron
    totaling $17.8 million, based upon Regeneron’s
    achieving a pre-defined IL-1 Trap development milestone. These
    amounts were recognized as research progress payments in 2004.

Contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long-term
    agreement with Merck, which expires in October 2006. Contract
    manufacturing revenue increased to $18.1 million in 2004
    from $10.1 million in 2003, principally due to an increase
    in product shipments to Merck in 2004 compared to 2003. Revenue
    and the related manufacturing expense are recognized as product
    is shipped, after acceptance by Merck. Included in contract
    manufacturing revenue in 2004 and 2003 are $3.6 million and
    $1.7 million, respectively, of deferred revenue associated
    with capital improvement reimbursements paid by Merck prior to
    commencement of production. This deferred revenue is being
    recognized as product is shipped to Merck based on the total
    amount of product expected to be shipped over the life of the
    manufacturing agreement. In February 2005, we agreed to extend
    the manufacturing agreement by one year through October 2006.

Research
    and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses increased slightly to
    $136.1 million in 2004 from $136.0 million in 2003.
    The following table summarizes the major categories of our
    research and development expenses for the years ended
    December 31, 2004 and 2003:

Represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
    research, preclinical development, and clinical trials,
    including related payroll and benefits, manufacturing materials
    and supplies, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our
    Rensselaer manufacturing facility.

Payroll and benefits increased $5.1 million in 2004 from
    2003 as we added research and development personnel to support
    our clinical and research programs, especially for the VEGF Trap
    and IL-1 Trap. Clinical trial expenses decreased
    $14.7 million in 2004 from 2003 due primarily to the
    completion of the double-blind treatment portion of our AXOKINE
    phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of obesity in
    2003, the completion of other AXOKINE trials in 2004, and the
    completion of our IL-4/13 Trap phase 1 trial in 2004. These
    decreases were partly offset by higher clinical trial expenses
    related to our VEGF Trap and IL-1 Trap clinical programs.
    Clinical manufacturing costs increased $6.6 million in 2004
    from 2003, as we manufactured supplies of our clinical product
    candidates in our expanded Rensselaer manufacturing facility for
    the full year of 2004. Research and preclinical development
    costs increased $3.5 million due primarily to higher
    preclinical development costs related to our VEGF Trap program
    and higher research-related costs for outside services in 2004
    than in 2003. Occupancy and other operating costs decreased
    slightly by $0.4 million in 2004 from 2003 resulting
    primarily from lower depreciation costs due to extending the
    lease on our Tarrytown, New York facilities in early 2004.

Contract
    Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses increased to $15.2 million
    in 2004, compared to $6.7 million in 2003, primarily
    because more product was shipped to Merck in 2004 and the
    Company incurred unfavorable manufacturing costs, which were
    expensed in the period incurred, in 2004 compared to 2003.



General
    and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $17.1 million in 2004 from $14.8 million in 2003, due
    primarily to a $1.4 million increase in professional fees,
    principally associated with accounting and other services
    related to our efforts to comply with the requirements of
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The
    remainder of the 2004 increase was principally due to increases
    in payroll and related costs associated, in part, with higher
    administrative headcount in 2004 to support the Company’s
    operations.

Other
    Income and Expense:

In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis notified us of its
    decision to forego its right under our collaboration to jointly
    develop the IL-1 Trap and subsequently paid us
    $42.75 million to satisfy its obligation to fund
    development costs for the IL-1 Trap for the nine-month period
    following its notification and for the two months prior to that
    notice. The $42.75 million was included in other contract
    income in 2004.

Investment income increased to $5.5 million in 2004 from
    $4.5 million in 2003 due primarily to higher effective
    interest rates on investment securities. Interest expense
    increased slightly to $12.2 million in 2004 from
    $11.9 million in 2003. Interest expense is attributable
    primarily to $200.0 million of convertible notes issued in
    October 2001, which mature in 2008 and bear interest at
    5.5% per annum.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our operations
    primarily through offerings of our equity securities, a private
    placement of convertible debt, revenue earned under our past and
    present research and development and contract manufacturing
    agreements, including our agreements with sanofi-aventis,
    Novartis, Procter & Gamble, and Merck, and investment
    income.

Change
    in Classification

We have revised in our previously issued financial statements
    included in this Report on

Form 10-K

the classification of our investments in auction rate securities
    from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments.
    Auction rate securities are securities that have stated
    maturities beyond three months, but are priced and traded as
    short-term investments due to the liquidity provided through the
    auction mechanism that generally resets interest rates every 28
    or 35 days. The change in classification resulted in a
    decrease in cash and cash equivalents and corresponding increase
    in short-term marketable securities at each balance sheet date.
    In addition, we revised our statements of cash flows included in
    this Report on

Form 10-K

to reflect the purchases and sales of these securities as
    investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash
    equivalents. This change in classification had no impact on our
    previously reported current assets, net income (loss), or cash
    flows from operations. We held no auction rate securities at
    December 31, 2005.

The impact of the revision to the classification of our
    investments in auction rate securities on previously reported
    amounts for cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable
    securities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and cash flows
    provided by (used in) investing activities for the three month,

Years
    Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004

Cash Used
    in Operations:

At December 31, 2005, we had $316.7 million in cash,
    cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared with
    $348.9 million at December 31, 2004. In January 2006,
    we received a $25.0 million up-front payment from
    sanofi-aventis, which was receivable at December 31, 2005,
    in connection with an amendment to our collaboration agreement
    to include Japan. In January 2005, we received two
    $25.0 million payments from sanofi-aventis. One payment was
    related to a VEGF Trap clinical milestone that was earned in
    2004. The second payment related to changes to our collaboration
    agreement with sanofi-aventis that were made in January 2005.

Net cash used in operations was $30.3 million in 2005
    compared to $16.9 million in 2004. In 2005, our net loss of
    $95.4 million included $21.9 million of non-cash
    stock-based employee compensation costs, of which
    $19.9 million represents Stock Option Expense resulting
    from our adoption of SFAS 123 in January 2005. Our deferred
    revenue balances increased by $14.5 million in 2005
    compared to 2004, due primarily to the January 2006
    $25.0 million up-front payment from sanofi-aventis (as
    described above), which was receivable at December 31,
    2005, partly offset by 2005 revenue recognition of
    $9.5 million from deferred sanofi-aventis up-front
    payments. In addition,

end-of-year

accounts receivable balances decreased by $6.6 million in
    2005 compared to 2004, due to lower amounts due from
    sanofi-aventis for reimbursement of VEGF Trap development
    expenses and the June 2005 completion of funding for Regeneron
    research activities under our collaboration with
    Procter & Gamble. In 2004, our net income of
    $41.7 million included (i) the March 2004 forgiveness
    of all outstanding loans from Novartis in an amount, including
    accrued interest, of $17.8 million, which we recognized as
    a research progress payment and (ii) revenue recognition of
    (a) $10.5 million from the deferred $80.0 million
    up-front payment received from sanofi-aventis in September 2003
    and (b) $22.1 million which represents the remaining
    deferred balance of the $27.0 million up-front payment
    received from Novartis in March 2003. In addition,

end-of-year

accounts receivable



balances increased by $27.6 million in 2004 due primarily
    to the $25.0 million milestone payment from sanofi- aventis
    that was earned in 2004 and paid in January 2005. The majority
    of cash used in operations in both 2005 and 2004 was to fund
    research and development, primarily related to our clinical
    programs.

In connection with our collaboration agreement with
    sanofi-aventis to jointly develop and commercialize the VEGF
    Trap, we have received up-front payments of $80.0 million
    in September 2003 and $25.0 million in January 2006 (which
    was receivable at December 31, 2005). Both up-front
    payments were recorded to deferred revenue and are being
    recognized as contract research and development revenue ratably
    over the period during which we expect to perform services. In
    2005 and 2004, we recognized $9.5 million and
    $10.5 million of revenue, respectively, related to these
    up-front payments and we anticipate, based on current VEGF Trap
    product development plans, that we will recognize approximately
    $12.2 million of revenue over each of the next 6 years
    and approximately $2.8 million for the subsequent
    3 years. Under the collaboration agreement, agreed upon
    worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies under
    the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. Sanofi-aventis
    funded $43.4 million, $67.8 million, and
    $10.7 million, respectively, of our VEGF Trap development
    costs in 2005, 2004, and 2003, of which $10.5 million,
    $13.9 million, and $8.9 million, respectively, were
    included in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005,
    2004, and 2003.

In both 2005 and 2004, we made two semi-annual interest payments
    totaling $11.0 million per year on our convertible senior
    subordinated notes.

Cash
    Provided by Investing Activities:

Net cash provided by investing activities increased to
    $115.5 million in 2005 from $10.2 million in 2004, due
    primarily to an increase in sales or maturities of marketable
    securities, net of purchases. In 2005, sales or maturities of
    marketable securities exceeded purchases by $120.5 million,
    whereas in 2004, sales or maturities of marketable securities
    exceeded purchases by $16.4 million.

Cash
    Provided by Financing Activities:

Cash provided by financing activities decreased to
    $4.1 million in 2005 from $4.4 million in 2004. In
    2005, cash provided by financing activities resulted from
    issuances of Common Stock in connection with exercises of
    employee stock options. In 2004, cash provided by financing
    activities related primarily to 2004 borrowings under a loan
    from Novartis. In accordance with our collaboration agreement
    with Novartis, we elected to fund our share of 2003 IL-1 Trap
    development expenses through a loan that was forgiven by
    Novartis in March 2004, as described above. In the first quarter
    of 2004, we drew $3.8 million, excluding interest, against
    this loan facility for expenses incurred during 2003.

Collaboration
    with the sanofi-aventis Group:

Under our collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, as
    described under “Collaborations” above, agreed upon
    worldwide VEGF Trap development expenses incurred by both
    companies during the term of the agreement, including costs
    associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supply, will be
    funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes
    profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for
    50% of these development expenses, including 50% of the
    $25.0 million payment received in connection with the
    January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement, in
    accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
    expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan
    royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. In addition, if
    the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product for intraocular
    delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale of a VEGF
    Trap product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin
    reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of VEGF
    Trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the
    first commercial VEGF Trap sale under the collaboration occurs.
    Since inception of the collaboration agreement through
    December 31, 2005, we and sanofi-aventis have incurred
    $130.5 million in agreed upon development expenses related
    to the VEGF Trap program. We and sanofi-aventis plan to initiate
    in 2006 multiple additional clinical studies to evaluate the
    VEGF Trap as both a single agent and in combination with other
    therapies in various cancer indications.



Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap
    development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
    rights to the VEGF Trap.

Severance
    Costs:

In September 2005, we announced plans to reduce our workforce by
    approximately 165 employees in connection with narrowing the
    focus of our research and development efforts, substantial
    improvements in manufacturing productivity, the June 2005
    expiration of our collaboration with Procter & Gamble,
    and the expected completion of contract manufacturing for Merck
    in late 2006. The majority of the headcount reduction occurred
    in the fourth quarter of 2005, with the remainder planned for
    2006 following the completion of our contract manufacturing
    activities for Merck.

Costs associated with the workforce reduction are comprised
    principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, and outplacement services. Termination costs
    related to 2005 workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth
    quarter of 2005, and included $0.2 million of non-cash
    expenses due to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options
    and restricted stock held by affected employees. Estimated
    termination costs associated with the planned workforce
    reduction in 2006 were measured in October 2005 and are being
    expensed ratably over the expected service period of the
    affected employees in accordance with SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities.

We estimate that total costs associated with the
    2005 and planned 2006 workforce reductions will approximate
    $2.7 million, of which $2.2 million was charged to
    expense in 2005 and approximately $0.5 million will be
    recognized as expense in 2006. We anticipate cost savings of
    approximately $8 million in 2006 resulting from the
    implementation of our workforce reduction plans.

Convertible
    Debt:

In 2001, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private
    placement and received proceeds, after deducting the initial
    purchasers’ discount and out-of pocket expenses, of
    $192.7 million. The notes bear interest at 5.5% per
    annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in 2008. The notes are
    convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion
    price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to
    adjustment in certain circumstances. We may redeem some or all
    of the notes if the closing price of our Common Stock has
    exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in effect for a
    specified period of time.

As part of this transaction, we pledged $31.6 million of
    U.S. government securities which was sufficient upon
    receipt of scheduled principal and interest payments to provide
    for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest
    payments on the notes when due, the last of which was paid in
    October 2004.

Capital
    Expenditures:

Our additions to property, plant, and equipment totaled
    $4.7 million in 2005, $6.0 million in 2004, and
    $16.9 million in 2003. In 2006, we expect to incur
    approximately $5 to $7 million in capital expenditures
    which primarily consists of equipment for our manufacturing,
    development, and research activities.

Funding
    Requirements:

Our total expenses for research and development from inception
    through December 31, 2005 have been approximately
    $1,013 million. We have entered into various agreements
    related to our activities to develop and commercialize product
    candidates and utilize our technology platforms, including
    collaboration agreements, such as those with sanofi-aventis,
    Novartis, and Procter & Gamble, and agreements to use
    our
    Velocigene

tm

technology platform, such as our agreement with Serono S.A. We
    incurred expenses associated with these agreements, which
    include an allocable portion of general and administrative
    costs, of $42.2 million, $75.3 million, and
    $56.0 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

We expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements
    primarily for research and development activities (including
    preclinical and clinical testing). We currently anticipate that
    approximately 55%-65% of our expenditures for 2006 will be
    directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of
    product candidates,



including the VEGF Trap, VEGF Trap-Eye, and IL-1 Trap;
    approximately 20%-25% of our expenditures for 2006 will be
    applied to our basic research activities and the continued
    development of our novel technology platforms; and the remainder
    of our expenditures for 2006 will be used for capital
    expenditures and general corporate purposes.

In connection with our funding requirements, the following table
    summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31,
    2005 for leases and long-term debt. None of these obligations
    extend beyond 3 years.

Excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities, real
    estate taxes, and operating expenses. In 2005, these costs were
    $9.5 million.

In connection with certain clinical trial contracts with service
    providers, we may incur early termination penalties if the
    contracts are cancelled before agreed-upon services are
    completed.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend on various
    factors, including the status of competitive products, the
    success of our research and development programs, the potential
    future need to expand our professional and support staff and
    facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual
    property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any
    of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent,
    and success of our collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Clinical
    trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and
    duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by
    clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs
    for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials,
    supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of
    funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends
    upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and
    early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the
    clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we
    decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost
    of each trial as described above. In the future, if we are able
    to successfully develop, market, and sell certain of our product
    candidates, we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise
    share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our
    collaboration and licensing agreements.

We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution,
    defense, and enforcement of patent and other intellectual
    property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of
    patent filings and prosecutions in the United States and foreign
    countries.

We believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to
    meet operating needs through at least mid-2008. However, this is
    a forward-looking statement based on our current operating plan,
    and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that
    would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before
    such time. If there is insufficient capital to fund all of our
    planned operations and activities, we believe we would
    prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical
    development of our product candidates. We have no off-balance
    sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any
    other entity. As of December 31, 2005, we had no
    established banking arrangements through which we could obtain
    short-term financing or a line of credit. In the event we need
    additional financing for the operation of our business, we will
    consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or
    private financing, including additional equity financing. In
    January 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on

Form S-3

to sell, in one or more offerings, up to $200.0 million of
    equity or debt securities, together or separately, which
    registration statement was declared effective in February 2005.
    However, there is no assurance that we will be able to complete
    any such offerings of securities. Factors influencing the
    availability of additional financing include our progress in
    product development, investor perception of our prospects, and
    the general condition of the financial markets. We may not be
    able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative
    arrangements or additional public or private offerings. If we
    cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements,
    we may have to delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain of our
    research and development activities or future operations. This
    could harm our business.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
    Estimates

Revenue
    Recognition:

We recognize revenue from contract research and development and
    research progress payments in accordance with Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104) and Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
    Deliverables

(EITF 00-21).

During the third quarter of 2003, we elected to change the
    method we use to recognize revenue under SAB 104 related to
    non-refundable collaborator payments, including up-front
    licensing payments, payments for development activities, and
    research progress (milestone) payments, to the Substantive
    Milestone Method, adopted retroactively to January 1, 2003.
    Under this method, for non-refundable up-front license payments
    that are not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone
    or for which an estimated level of required effort is not
    available, we recognize revenue ratably over the estimated
    period of time during which we expect to perform services under
    the agreement based on research and development plans. These
    estimated time periods are updated based on the results and
    progress of our research and development activities and
    revisions to these estimates could result in changes to the
    amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In
    addition, if a collaborator terminates the agreement in
    accordance with the terms of the contract, we would recognize
    the remainder of the up-front payment at the time of the
    termination. Payments for development activities are recognized
    as revenue as earned, over the period of effort. Payments which
    are based on achieving a specific substantive performance
    milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue
    when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due
    and non-refundable, provided there is no future service
    obligation associated with that milestone, a reasonable amount
    of time has passed between receipt of an up-front payment and
    achievement of the milestone, and the amount of the milestone
    payment is reasonable in relation to the effort, value, and risk
    associated with achieving the milestone. Previously, we had
    recognized revenue from non-refundable collaborator payments
    based on the percentage of costs incurred to date, estimated
    costs to complete, and total expected contract revenue. However,
    the revenue recognized was limited to the amount of
    non-refundable payments received. The change in accounting
    method was made because we believe that it better reflects the
    substance of our collaborative agreements and is more consistent
    with current practices in the biotechnology industry.

In connection with our VEGF Trap collaboration agreement with
    sanofi-aventis, we received non-refundable up-front payments of
    $80.0 million in September 2003 at the collaboration’s
    inception and $25.0 million in January 2006 in connection
    with the December 2005 amendment to the collaboration agreement
    to include Japan. These up-front payments were recorded to
    deferred revenue and are being recognized as contract research
    and development revenue over the period over which we are
    obligated to perform services. Also, in connection with our
    collaboration agreement with Novartis, in the first quarter of
    2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not to proceed
    with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap. Accordingly, the
    remaining balance of the $27.0 million up-front payment, or
    $22.1 million, was recognized as contract research and
    development revenue.

Recognition
    of Deferred Revenue Related to Contract Manufacturing
    Agreement:

We have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with
    Merck under which we manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our
    Rensselaer, New York facility and perform services. We recognize
    contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the
    product is tested and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping
    Point) to, Merck, and as services are performed. In connection
    with the agreement, we agreed to modify portions of our
    Rensselaer facility to manufacture Merck’s vaccine
    intermediate and Merck agreed to reimburse us for the related
    capital costs. These capital cost payments were deferred and are
    recognized as revenue as product is shipped to Merck, based upon
    our estimate of Merck’s order quantities each year through
    the expected end of the agreement which, for 2004 and prior
    years, was October 2005. Since we commenced production of the
    vaccine intermediate in November 1999, our estimates of
    Merck’s order quantities each year have not been materially
    different from Merck’s actual orders.

In February 2005, we agreed to extend the manufacturing
    agreement by one year through October 2006. As a result, in 2005
    we began recognizing the remaining deferred balance of
    Merck’s capital improvement reimbursements as of
    December 31, 2004, which totaled $2.7 million, as
    revenue as product is shipped to Merck, based upon Merck’s
    order quantities through October 2006.



Clinical
    Trial Accrual Estimates:

For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial
    costs, which are included in research and development expenses,
    are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in
    the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and the
    period over which clinical investigators or contract research
    organizations are expected to provide services. We believe that
    this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts
    we expend on a clinical trial. During the course of a trial, we
    adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual
    results differ from our estimates. No material adjustments to
    our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.

Depreciation
    of Property, Plant, and Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
    is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
    are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
    depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
    removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
    recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

7-30 years

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
    lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of
    construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized
    interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of
    the related asset.

In some situations, the life of the asset may be extended or
    shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe
    that the estimated life of the asset has changed. The life of
    leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of
    lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in the estimated
    lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the
    amount of depreciation recognized in future periods.

Stock-based
    Employee Compensation:

Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value based
    method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under
    the provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, using the modified prospective method as
    described in SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.

As
    a result, effective January 1, 2005, we have been
    recognizing expense, in an amount equal to the fair value of
    share-based payments (including stock option awards) on their
    date of grant, over the vesting period of the awards. Under the
    modified prospective method, we recognize compensation expense
    for (a) all share based payments granted on or after
    January 1, 2005, (including replacement options granted
    under our stock option exchange program which concluded on
    January 5, 2005) and (b) all awards granted to
    employees prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on
    that date. Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, we
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in APB 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
    interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense related to
    employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses
    in any period prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior
    period operating results have not been restated.

We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
    each option granted under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Using this model, fair value is
    calculated based on assumptions with respect to
    (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of our board of directors are expected to hold their options
    prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend
    yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest
    rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
    securities with maturities approximating the options’
    expected lives. Expected volatility, which is re-evaluated at
    least quarterly, has been estimated based on actual movements in
    our stock price over the most recent historical periods
    equivalent to the options’ expected lives. Expected lives
    are principally based on our limited historical exercise
    experience with option grants with similar exercise prices. The



expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends
    and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable
    future.

Future
    Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued SFAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment.

SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(which we adopted effective
    January 1, 2005), and supersedes APB 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

, and its related
    implementation guidance. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on
    accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
    services in share-based payment transactions, and requires the
    recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the
    fair value of the share-based payment (including stock options
    and restricted stock) issued to employees. SFAS 123R is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
    In March 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
    (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
    (SAB 107) which expresses views of the SEC staff
    regarding the application of SFAS 123R. Among other things,
    SAB 107 provides interpretive guidance related to the
    interaction between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and
    regulations as well as the SEC staff’s views regarding the
    valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public
    companies. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R effective for
    the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006, and intend to do
    so using the modified prospective method. Under the modified
    prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning
    with the effective date based on (a) the requirements of
    SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the
    effective date and (b) the requirements of SFAS 123
    for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date
    of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. In
    addition, we will consider the guidance of SAB 107 as we
    adopt SFAS 123R. Although the impact of adopting
    SFAS 123R has not yet been quantified, management believes
    that the adoption of this standard may have a material impact on
    our financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154,

Accounting
    Changes and Error Corrections.

SFAS 154 replaces
    APB 20,

Accounting Changes

, and SFAS 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements

, and requires retrospective application to
    prior-period financial statements of changes in accounting
    principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the
    period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of a change.
    SFAS 154 also redefines “restatement” as the
    revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect
    the correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for
    accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2005. We are required to
    adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning
    January 1, 2006.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to
    changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of
    available cash balances in investment grade corporate,
    asset-backed, and U.S. government securities. We do not
    believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates.
    Under our current policies we do not use interest rate
    derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate
    changes. We estimated that a one percent change in interest
    rates would result in changes in the fair market value of our
    investment portfolio of approximately $0.5 million and
    $1.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The decrease in the impact of an interest rate
    change at December 31, 2005, compared to December 31,
    2004, is due primarily to the shorter duration of our investment
    portfolio at the end of 2005.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of our
    chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted
    an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( the “Exchange
    Act” ) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer each concluded that, as of the end of such
    period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
    ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on
    a timely basis, and is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation
    of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting using the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on that evaluation our management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2005. PricewaterhouseCoopers
    LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has
    issued a report on management’s assessment and the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2005, which report is included herein at

page F-2.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting
    will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
    matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
    reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
    system are met and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the
    inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
    controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
    and instances of fraud or deviations, if any, within the company
    have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 financial statements
    and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003 financial
    statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Financial
    statements

In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the
    accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
    the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
    an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
    conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
    the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
    performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company

F-2


are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
    share data)

1.

Organization
    and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or
    “Regeneron”) was incorporated in January 1988 in the
    State of New York. The Company is engaged in research and
    development programs to discover and commercialize therapeutics
    to treat human disorders and conditions. The Company’s
    facilities are located in New York. The Company’s business
    is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to,
    uncertainties relating to conducting pharmaceutical research,
    obtaining regulatory approvals, commercializing products, and
    obtaining and enforcing patents.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Property,
    Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
    is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
    which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
    are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
    depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
    removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
    recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

7-30 years

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
    lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs of
    construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized
    interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of
    the related asset. The Company capitalized interest costs of
    $0.3 million in 2003. The Company did not capitalize any
    interest costs in 2004 or 2005.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and the balance
    sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
    with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported in the balance
    sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    determined based on standards that approximate the

first-in,

first-out method. Inventories are shown net of applicable
    reserves.

Revenue
    Recognition and Change in Accounting Principle

a.  Contract
    Research and Development and Research Progress
    Payments

The Company recognizes revenue from contract research and
    development and research progress payments in accordance with
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB 104”) and FASB Emerging Issue Task
    Force Issue

No. 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
    Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”).

SAB 104 superseded Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial
    Statement

(“SAB 101”), in December 2003.
    During the third quarter of 2003, the Company elected to change
    the method it uses to recognize revenue under SAB 101
    related to non-refundable collaborator payments, including
    up-front licensing payments, payments for development
    activities, and research progress (milestone) payments, to the
    Substantive Milestone Method, adopted retroactively to
    January 1, 2003. There was no cumulative effect of this
    change in accounting

    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

principle on prior periods. Under this method, for
    non-refundable up-front license payments that are not tied to
    achieving a specific performance milestone or for which an
    estimated level of required effort is not available, we
    recognize revenue ratably over the estimated period of time
    during which we expect to perform services under the agreement
    based on research and development plans. Payments for
    development activities are recognized as revenue as earned, over
    the period of effort. Payments which are based on achieving a
    specific substantive performance milestone, involving a degree
    of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is
    achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable,
    provided there is no future service obligation associated with
    that milestone, a reasonable amount of time has passed between
    receipt of an up-front payment and achievement of the milestone,
    and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in
    relation to the effort, value, and risk associated with
    achieving the milestone. The change in accounting method was
    made because the Company believes that it better reflects the
    substance of the Company’s collaborative agreements and is
    more consistent with current practices in the biotechnology
    industry.

Previously, the Company had recognized revenue from
    non-refundable collaborator payments based on the percentage of
    costs incurred to date, estimated costs to complete, and total
    expected contract revenue. However, the revenue recognized was
    limited to the amount of non-refundable payments received. This
    accounting method was adopted on January 1, 2000 upon the
    release of SAB 101. The cumulative effect of adopting
    SAB 101 at January 1, 2000 amounted to
    $1.6 million of additional loss, with a corresponding
    increase to deferred revenue that was recognized in subsequent
    periods, of which $0.1 million and $0.4 million,
    respectively, was included in contract research and development
    revenue in 2004 and 2003. The $1.6 million represented a
    portion of a 1989 payment received from Sumitomo Chemical Co.
    Ltd. in consideration for a fifteen year limited right of first
    negotiation to license up to three of the Company’s product
    candidates in Japan that expired in 2004 (see Note 12d).
    The effect of income taxes on the cumulative effect adjustment
    was immaterial.

b.  Contract
    Manufacturing

The Company has entered into a contract manufacturing agreement
    under which it manufactures product and performs services for a
    third party. Contract manufacturing revenue is recognized as
    product is shipped and as services are performed (see
    Note 13).

Investment
    Income

Interest income, which is included in investment income, is
    recognized as earned.

Accounting
    for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of
    long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and
    evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is determined to exist
    if estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the
    carrying amount in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 144,

Accounting
    for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

For all
    periods presented, no impairment losses were recorded.

Patents

As a result of the Company’s research and development
    efforts, it has obtained, applied for, or is applying for a
    number of patents to protect proprietary technology and
    inventions. All costs associated with patents are expensed as
    incurred.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs directly
    attributable to the conduct of research and development
    programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
    maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
    collaboration and licensing agreements (see Note 11e), the
    cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
    services related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical
    trial expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
    research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, expenses
    related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to
    commencing commercial production of a product under contract
    manufacturing arrangements, and the allocable portions of
    facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and
    maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All
    costs associated with research and development are expensed as
    incurred.

For each clinical trial that the Company conducts, certain
    clinical trial costs, which are included in research and
    development expenses, are expensed based on the expected total
    number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients
    enter the trial, and the period over which clinical
    investigators or contract research organizations are expected to
    provide services. During the course of a clinical trial, the
    Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense recognition if
    actual results differ from the Company’s estimates.

Per
    Share Data

Net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is computed on
    the basis of the net income (loss) for the period divided by the
    weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
    Class A Stock outstanding during the period. The basic net
    income (loss) per share excludes restricted stock awards until
    vested. The diluted net income per share for the year ended
    December 31, 2004 is based upon the weighted average number
    of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock and the common
    stock equivalents outstanding when dilutive. Common stock
    equivalents include: (i) outstanding stock options and
    restricted stock awards under the Company’s Long-Term
    Incentive Plans, which are included under the treasury stock
    method when dilutive, and (ii) Common Stock to be issued
    under the assumed conversion of the Company’s outstanding
    convertible senior subordinated notes, which are included under
    the if-converted method when dilutive. The computation of
    diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31,
    2005 and 2003 does not include common stock equivalents, since
    such inclusion would be antidilutive. Disclosures required by
    SFAS 128,

Earnings per Share

, have been included in
    Note 18.

Income
    Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
    method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined on
    the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts
    (“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in
    effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
    reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax
    assets for which realization is uncertain. See Note 16.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) represents the change in net assets
    of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
    other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
    Comprehensive income (loss) of the Company includes net income
    (loss) adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or loss on
    marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
    comprehensive income (loss) is immaterial. Comprehensive income
    for the year ended December 31, 2004 and comprehensive
    losses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003 have
    been included in the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents,
    marketable securities, and receivables from the sanofi-aventis
    Group and Merck & Co., Inc. The Company generally
    invests its excess cash in obligations of the
    U.S. government and its agencies, bank deposits,
    asset-backed securities, investment grade debt securities issued
    by corporations, governments, and financial institutions, and
    money market funds that invest in these instruments. The Company
    has established guidelines that relate to credit quality,
    diversification, and maturity, and that limit exposure to any
    one issue of securities.

Risks
    and Uncertainties

Regeneron has had no sales of its products and there is no
    assurance that the Company’s research and development
    efforts will be successful, that the Company will ever have
    commercially approved products, or that the Company will achieve
    significant sales of any such products. The Company has
    generally incurred net losses and negative cash flows from
    operations since its inception. Revenues to date have
    principally been limited to (i) payments from the
    Company’s collaborators and other entities for the
    Company’s development activities with respect to product
    candidates and to utilize the Company’s technology
    platforms, (ii) payments from two pharmaceutical companies
    for contract manufacturing, and (iii) investment income.
    The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in
    technology and is dependent upon the services of its employees,
    consultants, collaborators, and certain third-party suppliers,
    including single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers of
    certain raw materials and equipment. Regeneron, as licensee,
    licenses certain technologies that are important to the
    Company’s business which impose various obligations on the
    Company. If Regeneron fails to comply with these requirements,
    licensors may have the right to terminate the Company’s
    licenses.

Contract research and development revenue in 2005 was primarily
    earned from sanofi-aventis and The Procter & Gamble
    Company under collaboration agreements (see Notes 12a and
    12e). Under the collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis,
    agreed upon VEGF Trap development expenses incurred by Regeneron
    during the term of the agreement will be funded by
    sanofi-aventis. In addition, the Company earns revenue related
    to non-refundable, up-front payments from sanofi-aventis under
    the Substantive Milestone Method in accordance with
    SAB 104, as described above. The Company may also receive
    up to $400.0 million in milestone payments upon receipt of
    specified VEGF Trap marketing approvals. Sanofi-aventis has the
    right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least
    twelve months advance notice. Under the collaboration agreement
    with Procter & Gamble, as amended, Procter &
    Gamble made payments to fund Regeneron research of
    $2.5 million per quarter, plus adjustments for inflation,
    through June 2005. As of June 30, 2005, the Company and
    Procter & Gamble agreed that the research activities of
    the parties under the collaboration agreement were completed.
    Contract manufacturing revenue in 2005 was earned from Merck
    under a long-term manufacturing agreement that will expire in
    October 2006 (see Note 13).

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
    include (i) useful lives of property, plant, and equipment,
    (ii) the periods over which certain revenues and expenses
    will be recognized including contract research and development
    revenue recognized from non-refundable up-front payments,
    contract manufacturing revenue recognized from reimbursed
    deferred capital costs, and expense recognition of certain
    clinical trial costs which are included in research and
    development expenses, (iii) the extent to which deferred
    tax assets and liabilities are offset by a valuation allowance,
    and (iv) the fair value of stock options on their date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on
    assumptions with respect to (a) expected volatility of our
    Common Stock price, (b) the periods of time over which
    employees and members of the Company’s board of

directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise
    (expected lives), (c) expected dividend yield on the
    Company’s Common Stock, and (d) risk-free interest
    rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
    securities with maturities approximating the options’
    expected lives.

Stock-based
    Employee Compensation

Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair
    value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
    compensation under the provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, using the
    modified prospective method as described in SFAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.

As
    a result, effective January 1, 2005, the Company has been
    recognizing expense, in an amount equal to the fair value of
    share-based payments (including stock option awards) on their
    date of grant, over the vesting period of the awards. Under the
    modified prospective method, compensation expense for the
    Company is recognized for (a) all share based payments
    granted on or after January 1, 2005, (including replacement
    options granted under the Company’s stock option exchange
    program which concluded on January 5, 2005 (see
    Note 14a)) and (b) all awards granted to employees
    prior to January 1, 2005 that were unvested on that date.
    Prior to the adoption of the fair value method, the Company
    accounted for stock-based compensation to employees under the
    intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. (“APB”) 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
    interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense related to
    employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses
    in any period prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior
    period results have not been restated. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, non-cash stock-based employee
    compensation expense related to stock option awards (“Stock
    Option Expense”) totaled $20.0 million, of which
    $19.9 million was recognized in operating expenses and
    $0.1 million was capitalized in inventory. For the years
    ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 had the Company adopted
    the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
    employee compensation under the provisions of SFAS 123,
    Stock Option Expense would have totaled $33.6 million and
    $42.5 million, respectively, and the effect on the
    Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share
    would have been as follows:

In 2003, the Company’s chief executive officer was granted
    permission by the board of directors to initiate a net cashless
    exercise of stock options. Upon completion of the net cashless
    exercise, the Company recognized $0.3 million of
    compensation expense, which equaled the excess of the fair
    market value of the shares over the option exercise price on the
    date that the board of directors granted its consent for the
    transaction.

Statement
    of Cash Flows

Supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing
    activities:

In 2004 and 2003, the Company awarded 105,052 and
    219,367 shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock under the
    Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (see
    Note 14a). No Restricted Stock was awarded in 2005. The
    Company records unearned compensation in Stockholders’
    Equity related to these awards based on the fair market value of
    shares of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date of
    the Restricted Stock award, which is expensed, on a pro rata
    basis, over the period that the restrictions on these shares
    lapse. In 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company recognized
    $1.9 million, $2.5 million, and $2.3 million,
    respectively, of compensation expense related to Restricted
    Stock awards.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
    December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $0.2 million,
    $0.6 million, and $0.8 million of capital
    expenditures, respectively.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
    December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $0.6 million,
    $0.9 million, and $0.7 million, respectively, of
    accrued 401(k) Savings Plan contribution expense. During the
    first quarter of 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company contributed
    90,385, 64,333, and 42,543 shares, respectively, of Common
    Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in satisfaction of these
    obligations.

Included in marketable securities at December 31, 2005,
    2004, and 2003 were $1.2 million, $2.6 million, and
    $0.9 million of accrued interest income, respectively.

Future
    Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS 123R,

Share-Based
    Payment.

SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(which we adopted
    effective January 1, 2005, as described above), and
    supersedes APB 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees

, and its related implementation guidance.
    SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions
    in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based
    payment transactions, and requires the recognition of
    compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the
    share-based payment (including stock options and restricted
    stock) issued to employees. SFAS 123R is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. In March 2005,
    the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
    (’SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”) which
    expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the application of
    SFAS 123R. Among other things, SAB 107 provides
    interpretive guidance related to the interaction between
    SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations as well as
    the SEC staff’s views regarding the valuation of
    share-based payment arrangements for public companies. The
    Company is required to adopt SFAS 123R effective for the
    fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006, and intends to do so
    using the modified prospective method. Under the modified
    prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning
    with the effective date based on (a) the requirements of
    SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the
    effective date and (b) the requirements of SFAS 123
    for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date
    of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. In
    addition, the Company will consider the guidance of SAB 107
    as it adopts SFAS 123R. Although the impact of adopting
    SFAS 123R has not yet been quantified, management believes
    that the adoption of this standard may have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154,

Accounting
    Changes and Error Corrections.

SFAS 154 replaces
    APB 20,

Accounting Changes

, and SFAS 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements

, and requires retrospective application to
    prior-period financial statements of changes in accounting
    principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the
    period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of a change.
    SFAS 154 also redefines “restatement” as the
    revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect
    the correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for
    accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
    years beginning after

Severance
    Costs

In September 2005, the Company announced plans to reduce its
    workforce by approximately 165 employees in connection with
    narrowing the focus of the Company’s research and
    development efforts, substantial improvements in manufacturing
    productivity, the June 2005 expiration of the Company’s
    collaboration with The Procter & Gamble Company, and
    the expected completion of contract manufacturing for
    Merck & Co., Inc. in late 2006. The majority of the
    headcount reduction occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005, with
    the remainder planned for 2006 following the completion of the
    Company’s contract manufacturing activities for Merck.

Costs associated with the workforce reduction are comprised
    principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes,
    employee benefits, and outplacement services. Termination costs
    related to 2005 workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth
    quarter of 2005, and included non-cash expenses due to the
    accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted
    stock held by affected employees. Estimated termination costs
    associated with the planned workforce reduction in 2006 were
    measured in October 2005 and are being expensed ratably over the
    expected service period of the affected employees in accordance
    with SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
    or Disposal Activities.

The Company estimates that total
    costs associated with the 2005 and planned 2006 workforce

and losses are reported as a net amount in a separate component
    of stockholders’ equity entitled Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss). The net change in unrealized
    holding gains and losses is excluded from operations and
    included in stockholders’ equity as a separate component of
    comprehensive income (loss).

The Company has revised on its balance sheet at
    December 31, 2004 the classification of its investments in
    auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to
    short-term investments. Auction rate securities are securities
    that have stated maturities beyond three months, but are priced
    and traded as short-term investments due to the liquidity
    provided through the auction mechanism that generally resets
    interest rates every 28 or 35 days. The change in
    classification resulted in a decrease in cash and cash
    equivalents and corresponding increase in short-term marketable
    securities of $6.0 million at December 31, 2004. The
    Company held no auction rate securities at December 31,
    2005. In addition, the Company revised its statements of cash
    flows to reflect the purchases and sales of these securities as
    investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash
    equivalents, resulting in increases in cash flows from investing
    activities of $14.8 million and $14.2 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This
    change in classification had no impact on the Company’s
    previously reported current assets, net income (loss), or cash
    flows from operations.

The following tables summarize the amortized cost basis of
    marketable securities, the aggregate fair value of marketable
    securities, and gross unrealized holding gains and losses at

(Unless

Realized gains and losses are included as a component of
    investment income. For the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004, and 2003, gross realized gains and losses were not
    significant. In computing realized gains and losses, the Company
    computes the cost of its investments on a specific
    identification basis. Such cost includes the direct costs to
    acquire the securities, adjusted for the amortization of any
    discount or premium. The fair value of marketable securities has
    been estimated based on quoted market prices.

The following table shows the unrealized losses and fair value
    of the Company’s marketable securities with unrealized
    losses that are deemed to be only temporarily impaired,
    aggregated by investment category and length of time that
    individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss
    position, at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The securities
    listed at December 31, 2005 mature at various dates through

The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in
    corporate debt securities, U.S. government securities, and
    asset-backed securities were primarily caused by interest rate
    increases, which generally resulted in a decrease in the market
    value of the Company’s portfolio. Based upon the
    Company’s currently projected sources and uses of cash, the
    Company intends to hold these securities until a recovery of
    fair value, which may be maturity. Therefore, the Company does
    not consider these marketable securities at December 31,
    2005 and 2004 to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

Stockholders
    Equity

The Company’s Amended Certificate of Incorporation provides
    for the issuance of up to 40 million shares of Class A
    Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 160 million
    shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share. Shares
    of Class A Stock are convertible, at any time, at the
    option of the holder into shares of Common Stock on a

share-for-share

basis. Holders of Class A Stock have rights and privileges
    identical to Common Stockholders except that Class A
    Stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share, while Common
    Stockholders are entitled to one vote per share. Class A
    Stock may only be transferred to specified Permitted
    Transferees, as defined. The Company’s board of directors
    (the “Board”) is authorized to issue up to
    30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
    rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined
    by the Board.

During 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan in
    which Rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one
    Right for each share of Common Stock and Class A Stock
    (collectively, “Stock”) held by shareholders of record
    as of the close of business on October 18, 1996. Each Right
    initially entitles the registered holder to buy a unit
    (“Unit”) consisting of one-one thousandth of a share
    of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (“A
    Preferred Stock”) at a purchase price of $120 per Unit
    (the “Purchase Price”). Initially the Rights were
    attached to all Stock certificates representing shares then
    outstanding, and no separate Rights certificates were
    distributed. The Rights will separate from the Stock and a
    “distribution date” will occur upon the earlier of
    (i) ten days after a public announcement that a person or
    group of affiliated or associated persons, excluding certain
    defined persons, (an “Acquiring Person”) has acquired,
    or has obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of
    20% or more of the outstanding shares of Stock or (ii) ten
    business days following the commencement of a tender offer or
    exchange offer that would result in a person or group
    beneficially owning 20% or more of such outstanding shares of
    Stock. The Rights are not exercisable unless a distribution date
    occurs and will expire at the close of business on
    October 18, 2006 unless earlier redeemed by the Company,
    subject to certain defined restrictions, for $.01 per
    Right. In the event that an Acquiring Person becomes the
    beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares
    of Stock (unless such acquisition is made pursuant to a tender
    or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of the Company, at
    a price determined by a majority of the independent directors of
    the Company who are not representatives, nominees, affiliates,
    or associates of an Acquiring Person to be fair and otherwise in
    the best interest of the Company and its shareholders after
    receiving advice from one or more investment banking firms),
    each Right (other than Rights held by the Acquiring Person) will
    entitle the holder to purchase, at the Right’s then current
    exercise price, common shares (or, in certain circumstances,
    cash, property, or other securities of the Company) having a
    value twice the Right’s Exercise Price. The Right’s
    Exercise Price is the Purchase Price times the number of shares
    of Common Stock associated with each Right (initially, one).
    Upon the occurrence of any such events, the Rights held by an
    Acquiring Person become null and void. In certain circumstances,
    a Right entitles the

    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

holder to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock of an
    acquiring company having a value equal to two times the
    Right’s Exercise Price.

As a result of the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Company’s
    Board designated 100,000 shares of preferred stock as A
    Preferred Stock. The A Preferred Stock has certain preferences,
    as defined.

In October 2001, the Company completed a private placement of
    $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior
    subordinated notes, which are convertible into shares of the
    Company’s Common Stock. See Note 11d.

In March 2003, Novartis Pharma AG purchased $48.0 million
    of newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock. Regeneron issued 2,400,000 shares of Common Stock to
    Novartis in March 2003 and an additional 5,127,050 shares
    in May 2003 for a total of 7,527,050 shares based upon the
    average closing price of the Common Stock for the 20 consecutive
    trading days ending May 12, 2003. See Note 12b.

In August 2003, Regeneron issued to Merck & Co., Inc.,
    109,450 newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s
    Common Stock as consideration for a non-exclusive license
    agreement granted by Merck to the Company. In August 2004, the
    Company repurchased these shares from Merck for a purchase price
    of $0.9 million based on the fair market value of the
    shares on August 19, 2004. The shares were subsequently
    retired. See Note 11e.

In September 2003, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now a member
    of the sanofi-aventis Group) purchased 2,799,552 newly issued
    unregistered shares of the Company’s Common Stock for
    $45.0 million, based upon the average closing price of the
    Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days ending
    September 4, 2003. See Note 12a.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

a.  Operating
    Leases

The Company leases laboratory and office facilities in
    Tarrytown, New York under operating lease agreements which
    expire through December 2009 and contain renewal options for
    lease extensions on certain facilities through December 2014.
    The Company also leases manufacturing, office, and warehouse
    facilities in Rensselaer, New York under an operating lease
    agreement which expires in July 2007 and contains renewal
    options to extend the lease for two additional five-year terms
    and a purchase option. The leases provide for base rent plus
    additional rental charges for utilities, taxes, and operating
    expenses, as defined.

The Company leases certain laboratory and office equipment under
    operating leases which expire at various times through 2009.

At December 31, 2005, the future minimum noncancelable
    lease commitments under operating leases were as follows:

    $6.0 million, and $6.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

b.  Capital
    Leases

In 2003 and prior years, the Company had leased equipment under
    noncancelable capital leases. As of December 31, 2003, the
    Company had no remaining capital leases outstanding.

c.

Loan
    Payable

In March 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement with Novartis Pharma AG. In accordance with that
    agreement, Regeneron funded its share of 2003 collaboration
    development expenses through a loan from Novartis, which bore
    interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus 2.5%,
    compounded quarterly. In March 2004, Novartis forgave its
    outstanding loan to Regeneron totaling $17.8 million,
    including accrued interest, based on Regeneron’s achieving
    a pre-defined development milestone. See Note 12b.

d.

Convertible
    Debt

In October 2001, the Company issued $200.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated
    notes (“Notes”) in a private placement for proceeds to
    the Company of $192.7 million, after deducting the initial
    purchasers’ discount and

out-of-pocket

expenses (collectively, “Deferred Financing Costs”).
    The Notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable
    semi-annually, and mature on October 17, 2008. Deferred
    Financing Costs, which are included in other assets, are
    amortized as interest expense over the period from the
    Notes’ issuance to stated maturity. The Notes are
    convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into
    shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price
    of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to adjustment in
    certain circumstances. Regeneron may also redeem some or all of
    the Notes at any time if the closing price of the Company’s
    Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in
    effect for a specified period of time. The fair market value of
    the Notes fluctuates over time. The estimated fair value of the
    Notes at December 31, 2005 was approximately
    $193.1 million.

With respect to the Notes, the Company pledged as collateral
    $31.6 million of U.S. government securities
    (“Restricted Marketable Securities”) which matured at
    various dates through October 2004. Upon maturity, the proceeds
    of the Restricted Marketable Securities paid the scheduled
    interest payments made on the Notes in 2002, 2003, and 2004 when
    due. At December 31, 2004 there were no remaining
    Restricted Marketable Securities.

e.

Research
    Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company’s research and development efforts,
    the Company enters into research collaboration and licensing
    agreements with related and unrelated companies, scientific
    collaborators, universities, and consultants. These agreements
    contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and
    milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be provided,
    and ownership rights to certain proprietary technology developed
    under the agreements. Some of the agreements contain provisions
    which require the Company to pay royalties, as defined, at

F-21


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

rates that range from 0.25% to 16.5%, in the event the Company
    sells or licenses any proprietary products developed under the
    respective agreements.

Certain agreements under which the Company is required to pay
    fees permit the Company, upon 30 to

90-day

written notice, to terminate such agreements. With respect to
    payments associated with these agreements, the Company incurred
    expenses of $1.0 million, $1.4 million, and
    $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
    2004, and 2003, respectively.

In August 2003, Merck & Co., Inc. granted the Company a
    non-exclusive license agreement to certain patents and patent
    applications which may be used in the development and
    commercialization of products that act on the ciliary
    neurotrophic factor, or CNTF, receptor for the treatment of
    obesity. As consideration, the Company issued to Merck 109,450
    newly issued unregistered shares of its Common Stock (the
    “Merck Shares”), valued at $1.5 million based on
    the fair market value of shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock on the agreement’s effective date. In August 2004,
    the Company repurchased from Merck, and subsequently retired,
    the Merck Shares for $0.9 million based on the fair market
    value of the shares on August 19, 2004. The Company also
    made a cash payment of $0.6 million to Merck as required
    under the license agreement. The agreement also requires the
    Company to make an additional payment to Merck upon receipt of
    marketing approval for a product covered by the licensed
    patents. In addition, the Company would be required to pay
    royalties, at staggered rates in the mid-single digits, based on
    the net sales of products covered by the licensed patents.

12.

Research
    and Development Agreements

The Company has entered into various agreements related to its
    activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and
    utilize its technology platforms. Amounts earned by the Company
    in connection with these agreements, which were recognized as
    contract research and development revenue, research progress
    payments, or other contract income, as applicable, totaled
    $83.1 million, $198.7 million, and $47.4 million
    in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Total Company incurred
    expenses associated with these agreements, which include
    reimbursable and non-reimbursable amounts and an allocable
    portion of general and administrative costs, were
    $42.2 million, $75.3 million and $56.0 million in
    2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Significant agreements are
    described below.

a.

The
    sanofi-aventis Group

In September 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement (the “Aventis Agreement”) with Aventis
    Pharmaceuticals Inc. (now a member of the sanofi-aventis Group),
    to jointly develop and commercialize the Company’s Vascular
    Endothelial Growth Factor (“VEGF”) Trap. In connection
    with this agreement, sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable
    up-front payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552
    newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s Common
    Stock for $45.0 million, based upon the average closing
    price of the Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days
    ending September 4, 2003.

In January 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the
    Aventis Agreement to exclude intraocular delivery of the VEGF
    Trap to the eye (“Intraocular Delivery”) from joint
    development under the agreement, and product rights to the VEGF
    Trap in Intraocular Delivery reverted to Regeneron. In
    connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a
    $25.0 million non-refundable payment to Regeneron (the
    “Intraocular Termination Payment”) in January 2005.

In December 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the
    Aventis Agreement to expand the territory in which the companies
    are collaborating on the development of the VEGF Trap to include
    Japan. As a result, the collaboration now includes joint
    development of the VEGF Trap throughout the world in all
    indications, except for Intraocular Delivery. In connection with
    this amendment, sanofi-aventis agreed to make a
    $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to the
    Company, which was received in January 2006. The Company may
    also receive up to $40.0 million in milestone payments upon
    receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to five VEGF
    Trap

    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

indications in Japan and a royalty of approximately 35% on
    annual sales of the VEGF Trap in Japan, subject to certain
    potential adjustments.

Under the Aventis Agreement, as amended, Regeneron and
    sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
    sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap outside of Japan, except for
    sales in Intraocular Delivery. The Company may also receive up
    to $400.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
    receipt of specified marketing approvals, including up to $360.0
    million for up to eight VEGF Trap indications in the United
    States or the European Union. In December 2004, Regeneron earned
    a $25.0 million payment from sanofi-aventis, which was
    received in January 2005, upon the achievement of an early-stage
    clinical milestone.

Under the Aventis Agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide
    development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
    of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the
    collaboration becomes profitable, Regeneron will be obligated to
    reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses,
    or half of $130.5 million as of December 31, 2005, in
    accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
    expenses and Regeneron’s share of the collaboration profits
    and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at Regeneron’s
    option. Regeneron has the option to conduct additional
    pre-Phase III studies at its own expense. In connection
    with the January 2005 amendment to the Aventis Agreement, the
    Intraocular Termination Payment of $25.0 million will be
    considered a VEGF Trap development expense and will be subject
    to 50% reimbursement by Regeneron to sanofi-aventis, as
    described above, if the collaboration becomes profitable. In
    addition, if the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product in
    Intraocular Delivery predates the first commercial sale of a
    VEGF Trap product under the collaboration by two years,
    Regeneron will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to
    $7.5 million of VEGF Trap development expenses in
    accordance with a formula until the first commercial VEGF Trap
    sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
    cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
    termination of the agreement for any reason, Regeneron’s
    obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of VEGF Trap
    development expenses will terminate and the Company will retain
    all rights to the VEGF Trap.

Revenue related to payments from sanofi-aventis is being
    recognized under the Substantive Milestone Method (see
    Note 2) in accordance with SAB 104. The up-front
    payments received in September 2003 and January 2006, of
    $80.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively, and
    reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred development expenses, are
    being recognized as contract research and development revenue
    over the development period. Milestone payments are classified
    as research progress payments. In addition to the
    $25.0 million research progress payment earned in 2004, the
    Company recognized $43.4 million, $78.3 million, and
    $14.3 million of contract research and development revenue
    in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, in connection with the
    Aventis Agreement. The Company also recognized the
    $25.0 million Intraocular Termination Payment as other
    contract income in 2005. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    amounts receivable from sanofi-aventis totaled
    $36.4 million and $39.4 million, respectively, and
    deferred revenue was $81.6 million and $65.8 million,
    respectively.

b.

Novartis
    Pharma AG

In March 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement (the “Novartis Agreement”) with Novartis
    Pharma AG to jointly develop and commercialize the
    Company’s Interleukin-1 Cytokine Trap (“IL-1
    Trap”). In connection with this agreement, Novartis made a
    non-refundable up-front payment of $27.0 million and
    purchased $48.0 million of newly issued unregistered shares
    of the Company’s Common Stock. Regeneron issued
    2,400,000 shares of Common Stock to Novartis in March 2003
    and an additional 5,127,050 shares in May 2003 for a total
    of 7,527,050 shares based upon the average closing price of
    the Common Stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending
    May 12, 2003.

Development expenses incurred during 2003 were shared equally by
    the Company and Novartis. Regeneron funded its share of 2003
    development expenses through a loan (the “2003 Loan”)
    from Novartis, which bore interest

REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus 2.5%,
    compounded quarterly. As of December 31, 2003, the 2003
    Loan balance due Novartis, including accrued interest, totaled
    $13.8 million. In March 2004, Novartis forgave the 2003
    Loan and accrued interest thereon, totaling $17.8 million,
    based on Regeneron’s achieving a pre-defined development
    milestone.

In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not
    to proceed with the joint development of the

IL-1

Trap.
    In March 2004, Novartis agreed to pay the Company
    $42.75 million to satisfy its obligation to fund
    development costs for the IL-1 Trap for the nine month period
    following its notification and for the two months prior to that
    notice. The Company recorded the $42.75 million as other
    contract income in 2004. Regeneron and Novartis each retain
    rights under the collaboration agreement to elect to collaborate
    in the future on the development and commercialization of
    certain other IL-1 antagonists.

Revenue related to payments from Novartis was recognized under
    the Substantive Milestone Method (see Note 2) in
    accordance with SAB 104. The up-front payment of
    $27.0 million and reimbursement of Novartis’ share of
    Regeneron-incurred development expenses were recognized as
    contract research and development revenue. Forgiveness in 2004
    of the 2003 Loan and accrued interest was recognized as a
    research progress payment. In 2003, the Company recognized
    $21.4 million of contract research and development revenue
    in connection with the Novartis Agreement. In 2004, the Company
    recognized contract research and development revenue of
    $22.1 million, which represented the remaining amount of
    the $27.0 million up-front payment from Novartis that had
    previously been deferred. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    there were no amounts receivable from Novartis and no deferred
    revenue.

c.

Amgen
    Inc.

In August 1990, the Company entered into a collaboration
    agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with Amgen Inc. to
    develop and attempt to commercialize two proprietary products
    (the “Products”). The Amgen Agreement, among other
    things, provided for Amgen and the Company to form a partnership
    (“Amgen-Regeneron Partners” or the
    “Partnership”) to complete the development and to
    commercialize the Products. Amgen and the Company held equal
    ownership interests in the Partnership. In November 2005, the
    Company and Amgen agreed to terminate the Amgen Agreement and
    Amgen-Regeneron Partners, as there were no ongoing activities to
    develop the Products, and in December 2005, the Company and
    Amgen each made capital withdrawals of $0.5 million from
    the Partnership. Neither party is entitled to receive royalties
    based on any products arising from the collaboration. The
    Company accounted for its investment in the Partnership in
    accordance with the equity method of accounting. In 2005, 2004,
    and 2003, the Company recognized its share of the Partnership
    net income (loss) in the amounts of $10 thousand, $134 thousand,
    and ($63 thousand), respectively, which represents 50% of the
    total Partnership net income (loss). Selected financial data of
    the Partnership as of and for the years ended December 31,
    2005, 2004, and 2003 are not significant.

In July 2002, Amgen and Immunex Corporation (now part of Amgen)
    granted the Company a non-exclusive license to certain patents
    and patent applications which may be used in the development and
    commercialization of the IL-1 Trap. The license followed two
    other licensing arrangements under which Regeneron obtained a
    non-exclusive license to patents owned by ZymoGenetics, Inc. and
    Tularik Inc. for use in connection with the IL-1 Trap program.
    These license agreements would require the Company to pay
    royalties based on the net sales of the IL-1 Trap if and when it
    is approved for sale. In total, the royalty rate under these
    three agreements would be in the mid-single digits.

d.

Sumitomo
    Chemical Company, Ltd.

During 1989, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. entered into a
    Technology Development Agreement (“TDA”) with
    Regeneron and paid the Company $5.6 million. In
    consideration for this payment, Sumitomo Chemical

    data)

received a fifteen year limited right of first negotiation to
    license up to three of the Company’s product candidates in
    Japan. In connection with the Company’s implementation of
    SAB 101 (see Note 2), the Company recognized this
    payment as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the
    TDA. The TDA expired in March 2004.

e.

The
    Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, the Company entered into a long-term collaboration
    agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company to
    discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products and
    Procter & Gamble agreed to provide funding for
    Regeneron’s research efforts related to the collaboration.

Effective December 31, 2000, the Company and
    Procter & Gamble entered into a new collaboration
    agreement (the “P&G Agreement”), replacing the
    companies’ May 1997 agreement. The P&G Agreement
    extended Procter & Gamble’s obligation to
    fund Regeneron research through December 2005, with no
    further research obligations by either party thereafter, and
    focused the companies’ collaborative research on
    therapeutic areas that were of particular interest to
    Procter & Gamble. Under the P&G Agreement, research
    support from Procter & Gamble was $2.5 million per
    quarter, plus adjustments for inflation, through December 2005.
    Procter & Gamble and the Company divided rights to
    programs from their former collaboration agreement that were no
    longer part of the P&G Agreement.

In June 2005, the Company and Procter & Gamble amended
    the P&G Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the modified
    agreement, the Company and Procter & Gamble agreed that
    the research activities of the parties under the P&G
    Agreement were completed on June 30, 2005, six months prior
    to the December 31, 2005 expiration date in the P&G
    Agreement. In connection with the amendment, Procter &
    Gamble made a one-time $5.6 million payment to Regeneron
    and the Company paid approximately $1.0 million to
    Procter & Gamble to acquire certain capital equipment
    owned by Procter & Gamble and located at the
    Company’s facilities. Procter & Gamble and the
    Company divided rights to research programs and pre-clinical
    product candidates that were developed during the research term
    of the P&G Agreement. Neither party has the right to
    participate in the development or commercialization of the other
    party’s product candidates. The Company is entitled to
    receive royalties based on any future product sales of a
    Procter & Gamble pre-clinical candidate arising from
    the collaboration. In addition, in 1997 through 1999,
    Procter & Gamble provided research support for the
    Company’s AXOKINE program and, as a result, will be
    entitled to receive a small royalty on any sales of AXOKINE.
    Neither party is entitled to receive royalties or other payments
    based on any other products arising from the collaboration.

Contract research and development revenue related to the
    Company’s collaboration with Procter & Gamble was
    $6.0 million, $10.5 million, and $10.6 million in
    2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In addition, the one-time
    $5.6 million payment made by Procter & Gamble to
    the Company in connection with the amendment to the P&G
    Agreement was recognized as other contract income in 2005. At
    December 31, 2004 and 2003, amounts receivable from
    Procter & Gamble totaled $2.3 million and
    $2.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005,
    there were no amounts receivable from Procter & Gamble.

f.

Serono,
    S.A.

In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement (the
    “Serono Agreement”) with Serono S.A. to use
    Regeneron’s proprietary VelociGene technology platform to
    provide Serono with knock-out and transgenic mammalian models of
    gene function (“Materials”). Serono made an advance
    payment of $1.5 million (the “Retainer”) to
    Regeneron in December 2002, which was accounted for as deferred
    revenue. Regeneron recognizes revenue and reduces the Retainer
    as Materials are shipped to and accepted by Serono. The Serono
    Agreement contains provisions for minimum yearly order
    quantities and replenishment of the Retainer when the balance
    declines below a specified threshold. In 2005, 2004, and 2003,
    the Company recognized $2.2 million, $2.1 million,

and $0.7 million, respectively, of contract research and
    development revenue in connection with the Serono Agreement.

13.

Manufacturing
    Agreement

During 1995, the Company entered into a long-term manufacturing
    agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., as amended, (the
    “Merck Agreement”) to produce an intermediate (the
    “Intermediate”) for a Merck pediatric vaccine at the
    Company’s Rensselaer, New York facility. The Company agreed
    to modify portions of its facility for manufacture of the
    Intermediate and to assist Merck in securing regulatory approval
    for such manufacture in the Company’s facility. The Merck
    Agreement calls for the Company to manufacture Intermediate for
    Merck for a specified period of time (the “Production
    Period”), with certain minimum order quantities each year.
    The Production Period commenced in November of 1999 and
    originally extended for six years. In February 2005, the Company
    and Merck amended the Merck Agreement to extend the Production
    Period through October 2006, after which the Merck Agreement
    will terminate.

Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the capital costs to
    modify the facility (“Capital Costs”). Merck also
    agreed to pay an annual facility fee (the “Facility
    Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning March 1995, subject to
    annual adjustment for inflation. During the Production Period,
    Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for certain manufacturing
    costs, pay the Company a variable fee based on the quantity of
    Intermediate supplied to Merck, and make additional bi-annual
    payments (“Additional Payments”), as defined. In
    addition, Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the cost of
    Company activities performed on behalf of Merck prior to the
    Production Period and for miscellaneous costs during the
    Production Period (“Internal Costs”). These payments
    are recognized as contract manufacturing revenue as follows:
    (i) payments for Internal Costs are recognized as the
    activities are performed, (ii) the Facility Fee and
    Additional Payments are recognized over the period to which they
    relate, (iii) payments for Capital Costs were deferred and
    are recognized as Intermediate is shipped to Merck, and
    (iv) payments related to the manufacture of Intermediate
    during the Production Period (“Manufacturing
    Payments”) are recognized after the Intermediate is tested
    and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck.

In 2005, 2004, and 2003, Merck contract manufacturing revenue
    totaled $13.7 million, $18.1 million, and
    $10.1 million, respectively. Such amounts include
    $1.4 million, $3.6 million, and $1.7 million of
    previously deferred Capital Costs, respectively.

14.

Incentive
    and Stock Purchase Plans

a.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plans

During 2000, the Company established the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2000
    Incentive Plan”) which, as amended, provides for the
    issuance of up to 18,500,000 shares of Common Stock in
    respect of awards. In addition, shares of Common Stock
    previously approved by shareholders for issuance under the
    Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan
    (“1990 Incentive Plan”) that are not issued under the
    1990 Incentive Plan, may be issued as awards under the 2000
    Incentive Plan. Employees of the Company, including officers,
    and nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members
    of the board of directors, (collectively,
    “Participants”) may receive awards as determined by a
    committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The
    awards that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include:
    (a) Incentive Stock Options (“ISOs”) and
    Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
    (c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and
    (e) Other Awards.

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right to purchase
    shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the Committee;
    however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise price will
    not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common
    Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest over a
    period of time determined by the

F-26


REGENERON
    PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless
    otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share
    data)

Committee, generally on a pro rata basis over a three to five
    year period. The Committee also determines the expiration date
    of each Option; however, no ISO is exercisable more than ten
    years after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares of restricted
    Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase such shares at a
    price determined by the Committee. Such shares are
    nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee
    (“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as
    defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the
    Restricted Stock, which has not vested, will be transferred to
    the Company, except under defined circumstances with Committee
    approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the
    Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company
    requires a return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the
    right to require a return of all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the right to
    receive, within 30 days of the date on which the share
    vests, an amount, in cash

and/or

shares of the Company’s Common Stock as determined by the
    Committee, equal to the sum of the fair market value of a share
    of Common Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests
    and the aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to
    a share of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of
    the share of Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests.
    Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock
    which are granted at the discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are valued based on
    the Company’s Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of
    the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions of such Other
    Awards are determined solely on the authority of the Committee.

During 1990, the Company established the 1990 Incentive Plan
    which, as amended, provided for a maximum of
    6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of awards.
    Employees of the Company, including officers, and nonemployees,
    including consultants and nonemployee members of the board of
    directors, received awards as determined by a committee of
    independent directors. Under the provisions of the 1990
    Incentive Plan, there will be no future awards from the plan.
    Awards under the 1990 Incentive Plan consisted of Incentive
    Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock Options which generally
    vest on a pro rata basis over a three or five year period and
    have a term of ten years.

The 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans contain provisions that allow
    for the Committee to provide for the immediate vesting of awards
    upon a change in control of the Company, as defined.

As described in Note 2, effective January 1, 2005, the
    Company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for
    stock-based employee compensation under the provisions of
    SFAS 123 using the modified prospective method as described
    in SFAS 148. As a result, effective January 1, 2005,
    the Company has been recognizing expense, in an amount equal to
    the fair value of share-based payments (including stock option
    awards) on their date of grant, over the vesting period of the
    awards. Under the modified prospective method, compensation
    expense for the Company is recognized for (a) all share
    based payments granted on or after January 1, 2005,
    (including replacement options granted under the Company’s
    stock option exchange program which concluded on January 5,
    2005) and (b) all awards granted to employees prior to
    January 1, 2005 that were unvested on that date. Prior to
    the adoption of the fair value method, the Company accounted for
    stock-based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value
    method of accounting set forth in APB 25 and related
    interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense related to
    employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses
    in any period prior to the first quarter of 2005 and prior
    period results have not been restated. The effect on the
    Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share
    for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, had
    compensation costs for the Incentive Plans been determined in
    accordance with the fair value based method of accounting for
    stock-based employee compensation as prescribed by
    SFAS 123, is shown in Note 2.

Prior to the Company’s adoption of SFAS 123, in
    accordance with APB 25 and related interpretations, the
    Company recorded compensation expense from issuances of employee
    Restricted Stock awards. When the terms of

    data)

the award were fixed, compensation expense for Restricted Stock
    awards totaled the grant date intrinsic value, amortized over
    the vesting period.

Transactions involving stock option awards during 2005, 2004,
    and 2003 under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans are summarized
    in the table below.

In addition, in October 2005, the Company accelerated vesting of
    certain stock options held by employees affected by the
    Company’s 2005 workforce reductions (see Note 3).

The Company grants stock options with exercise prices that are
    equal to or greater than the fair market value of the
    Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The table
    below summarizes the weighted-average exercise prices and
    weighted-average grant-date fair values of options issued during
    the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005. The
    total number of options exercisable at December 31, 2005,
    2004, and 2003 was 7,321,256, 8,628,873, and 5,940,268,
    respectively, with weighted average exercise prices of $17.79,

The fair value of each option granted under the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Incentive Plan during 2005, 2004, and
    2003 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. Using this model, fair value is calculated
    based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected
    volatility of the Company’s Common Stock price,
    (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members
    of the Company’s board of directors are expected to hold
    their options prior to exercise (expected lives),
    (iii) expected dividend yield on the Company’s Common
    Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based
    on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with
    maturities approximating the options’ expected lives.
    Expected volatility, which is re-evaluated at least quarterly,
    has been estimated based on actual movements in the
    Company’s stock price over the most recent historical
    periods equivalent to the options’ expected lives. Expected
    lives are principally based on the Company’s limited
    historical exercise experience with option grants with similar
    exercise prices. The expected dividend yield is zero as the
    Company has never paid dividends and does not currently
    anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. The following
    table summarizes the weighted average values of the assumptions
    used in computing the fair value of option grants during 2005,
    2004, and 2003.

During 2004 and 2003, 105,052 and 219,367 shares,
    respectively, of Restricted Stock were awarded under the 2000
    Incentive Plan. No shares of Restricted Stock were awarded in
    2005. These shares are nontransferable with such restriction
    lapsing (i) for 2004 awards, with respect to 50% of the
    shares at nine months and eighteen months from date of grant and
    (ii) for 2003 awards, with respect to 25% of the shares
    every six months over the approximately two-year period from
    date of grant. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, the Company recorded unearned compensation within
    Stockholders’ Equity of $1.0 million and
    $2.9 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to
    these awards. This amount was based on the fair market value of
    shares of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant
    and will be expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the period that
    the restriction on these shares lapses. During 2005, 2004, and
    2003, 4,601, 18,194, and 4,431 shares, respectively, of
    Restricted Stock were forfeited due to employee terminations.
    The Company reduced unearned compensation within
    Stockholders’ Equity by $0.1 million,
    $0.3 million, and $0.1 million in 2005, 2004, and
    2003, respectively, related to these forfeited awards.

The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense from
    Restricted Stock awards of $1.9 million, $2.5 million,
    and $2.3 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In
    addition, due to the adoption of SFAS 123

effective January 1, 2005, non-cash compensation expense
    related to stock option awards totaled $20.0 million in
    2005, of which $19.9 million was recognized in operating
    expenses and $0.1 million was capitalized into inventory.

As of December 31, 2005, there were 6,684,884 shares
    available for future grants under the 2000 Incentive Plan.

In December 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved a
    stock option exchange program. Under the program, Company
    regular employees who work an average of 20 hours per week,
    other than the Company’s chairman and the Company’s
    president and chief executive officer, were provided the
    opportunity to make a one-time election to surrender options
    granted under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans that had an
    exercise price of at least $18.00 and exchange them for
    replacement options granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan in
    accordance with the following exchange ratios:

$18.00 to $28.00

Participation in the stock option exchange program was
    voluntary, and non-employee directors, consultants, former
    employees, and retirees were not eligible to participate. The
    participation deadline for the program was January 5, 2005.
    Eligible employees elected to exchange options with a total of
    3,665,819 underlying shares of Common Stock, and the Company
    issued 1,977,840 replacement options with an exercise price of
    $8.50 per share on January 5, 2005.

Each replacement option was completely unvested upon grant. Each
    replacement option granted to an employee other than our
    executive vice president and senior vice presidents will
    ordinarily become vested and exercisable with respect to
    one-fourth of the shares initially underlying such option on
    each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the
    grant date so that such replacement option will be fully vested
    and exercisable four years after it was granted. Each
    replacement option granted to our executive vice president and
    senior vice presidents will ordinarily vest with respect to all
    shares underlying such option if both (i) the
    Company’s products have achieved gross sales of at least
    $100 million during any consecutive twelve month period
    (either directly by the Company or through its licenses) and
    (ii) the specific senior or executive vice president has
    remained employed by the Company for at least three years from
    the date of grant. For all replacement options, the
    recipient’s vesting and exercise rights are contingent upon
    the recipient’s continued employment through the applicable
    vesting date and subject to the other terms of the 2000
    Incentive Plan and the applicable option award agreement. As is
    generally the case with respect to the option award agreements
    for options that were eligible for exchange pursuant to the
    stock option exchange program, the option award agreements for
    replacement options include provisions whereby the replacement
    options may be fully vested in connection with a “change in
    control” of the Company, as defined in the 2000 Incentive
    Plan.

Under the stock option exchange program, each replacement option
    has a term equal to the greater of (i) the remaining term
    of the surrendered option it replaces and (ii) six years
    from the date of grant of the replacement option. This was
    intended to ensure that the employees who participated in the
    stock option exchange program would not derive any additional
    benefit from an extended option term unless the surrendered
    option had a remaining term of less than six years.

b.  Executive
    Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock Purchase Plan
    (the “Plan”) under which 1,027,500 shares of
    Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock awards.
    The Plan provides for the compensation committee of the board of
    directors to award employees, directors, consultants, and other
    individuals (“Plan participants”) who render service
    to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock at a
    price set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides for
    the vesting of shares as determined by the compensation
    committee and, should the Company’s relationship with a
    Plan participant terminate before all shares are vested,
    unvested shares will be repurchased by the Company at a price
    per share equal to the original amount paid by the Plan
    participant. During 1989 and 1990, a total of
    983,254 shares were issued, all of which vested as of
    December 31, 1999. As of December 31, 2005, there were
    44,246 shares available for future grants under the Plan.

15.

Employee
    Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of the Regeneron
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Savings
    Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide for employees
    who have met defined service requirements to participate in the
    Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the Savings Plan a
    percentage of their compensation to be set aside to pay their
    future retirement benefits, as defined. The Savings Plan, as
    amended and restated, provides for the Company to make
    discretionary contributions (“Contribution”), as
    defined. The Company recorded Contribution expense of
    $2.0 million in 2005, $0.8 million in 2004, and
    $0.9 million in 2003; such amounts were accrued as
    liabilities at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
    respectively. During the first quarter of 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    the Company contributed 120,960, 90,385, and 64,333 shares,
    respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings Plan in
    satisfaction of these obligations.

16.

Income
    Taxes

In 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company recognized a net operating
    loss for tax purposes and, accordingly, no provision for income
    taxes has been recorded in the accompanying financial
    statements. There is no benefit for federal or state income
    taxes for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003
    since the Company has incurred net operating losses for tax
    purposes since inception and established a valuation allowance
    equal to the total deferred tax asset.

The tax effect of temporary differences, net operating loss
    carry-forwards, and research and experimental tax credit
    carry-forwards as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was as
    follows:

The Company’s valuation allowance increased by
    $40.5 million in 2005, due primarily to an increase in the
    Company’s net operating loss carry-forward, and decreased
    by $14.2 million in 2004, due primarily to a reduction in
    the temporary difference related to deferred revenue.

NOTES TO

(Unless

    data)

For all years presented, the Company’s effective income tax
    rate is zero. The difference between the Company’s
    effective income tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 34%
    is attributable to state tax benefits and tax credit
    carry-forwards offset by an increase in the deferred tax
    valuation allowance.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had available for tax
    purposes unused net operating loss carry-forwards of
    $404.8 million which will expire in various years from 2006
    to 2025. The Company’s research and experimental tax credit
    carry-forwards expire in various years from 2006 to 2025. Under
    the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions,
    substantial changes in the Company’s ownership have
    resulted in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating
    loss and tax credit carry-forwards that can be utilized in
    future years to offset future taxable income. This annual
    limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses
    and tax credit carry-forwards before utilization.

17.

Legal
    Matters

In May 2003, securities class action lawsuits were commenced
    against Regeneron and certain of the Company’s officers and
    directors in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of New York. A consolidated amended class action
    complaint was filed in October 2003. The complaint, which was
    purported to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of
    investors in the Company’s publicly traded securities
    between March 28, 2000 and March 30, 2003, alleged
    that the defendants misstated or omitted material information
    concerning the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE, in violation of
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act
    of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder.

On November 14, 2005, the United States District Court for
    the Southern District of New York approved the terms of a
    settlement between plaintiffs and the Company settling all
    claims against the Company in this lawsuit. The settlement
    requires no payment by the Company or any of the individual
    defendants named in the lawsuit. The Company’s primary
    insurance carrier agreed to make the required payment under the
    settlement, the amount of which is immaterial to the Company.
    The settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing by the
    Company or any of the individual defendants. Separately, the
    plaintiffs and the individual defendants named in the lawsuit
    entered into a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, which
    dismissed all claims against the individuals with prejudice.

From time to time, the Company is a party to other legal
    proceedings in the course of the Company’s business. The
    Company does not expect any such other current legal proceedings
    to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business
    or financial condition.

18.

Net
    Income (Loss) Per Share

The Company’s basic net income (loss) per share amounts
    have been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
    average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding.
    The diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted
    average number of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock
    and the common stock equivalents outstanding when dilutive. In
    2005 and 2003, the Company reported net losses and, therefore,
    no
