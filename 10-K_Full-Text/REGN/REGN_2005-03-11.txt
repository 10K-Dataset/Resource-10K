General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company
that discovers, develops, and intends to commercialize
pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical
conditions. Our clinical and preclinical pipeline includes
product candidates for the treatment of cancer, diseases of the
eye, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions,
allergies, asthma, and other diseases and disorders. Developing
and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and
expense. Since inception we have not generated any sales or
profits from the commercialization of any of our product
candidates.

Our core business strategy is to combine our strong foundation
in basic scientific research and discovery-enabling technology
with our manufacturing and clinical development capabilities to
build a successful, integrated biopharmaceutical company. Our
efforts have yielded a diverse pipeline of product candidates
that we believe has the potential to address a variety of
serious medical conditions. We believe that our ability to
develop product candidates is enhanced by the application of our
technology platforms. These platforms are designed to discover
specific genes of therapeutic interest for a particular disease
or cell type and validate targets through high-throughput
production of mammalian models. We continue to invest in the
development of enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to
identify, develop, and commercialize new product candidates.

Here is a summary of the clinical status of our clinical
candidates as of December 31, 2004:

•

VEGF TRAP — Oncology:

Protein-based product
    candidate designed to bind Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
    (called VEGF, also known as Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF)
    and the related Placental Growth Factor (called PlGF), and
    prevent their interaction with cell surface receptors. VEGF (and
    to a less validated degree, PlGF) is required for the growth of
    new blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a
    potent regulator of vascular permeability and leakage. In 2001,
    we initiated a dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trial
    designed to assess the safety and tolerability of the VEGF Trap
    in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The
    preliminary results of this study were announced at the annual
    meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology
    (ASCO) in June 2004 and we updated these results in a
    poster session at the 16th Annual EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on
    Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in September 2004. The
    phase 1 trial was an open label, dose-escalation study
    conducted at three sites in the United States. The study
    enrolled and treated 38 patients with incurable, relapsed,
    or refractory solid tumors with subcutaneous injections of VEGF
    Trap. In total, the trial enrolled patients with 15 different
    types of cancer. Preliminary results of this study indicated
    that:

•

the VEGF Trap was generally well-tolerated at the dose levels
    studied, and

•

circulating levels of the VEGF Trap at the highest dose (1.6
    milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) per week) were
    consistent with levels observed to be effective in preclinical
    models.



•

VEGF TRAP — Eye Diseases:

VEGF both stimulates
    angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability. It has been
    shown in preclinical studies to be a major pathogenic factor in
    diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and age-related
    macular degeneration, and is believed to be involved in other
    medical problems affecting the eyes. In January 2005, we and
    sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to exclude
    rights to develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap for eye
    diseases through local delivery systems. We now have the
    exclusive right to develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap for
    eye diseases through local administration to the eye and plan to
    initiate a clinical trial of the VEGF Trap delivered through
    intravitreal injection in mid-2005. While use of the VEGF Trap
    for eye diseases using systemic delivery remains part of our
    collaboration with sanofi-aventis, we and sanofi-aventis do not
    currently intend to pursue further clinical development using
    systemic delivery of VEGF Trap for eye diseases. Two
    phase 1 clinical trials of the VEGF Trap delivered
    systemically for the potential treatment of eye diseases were
    completed in 2004. We expect to discuss the results from these
    trials at scientific conferences in 2005.

•

INTERLEUKIN-1 TRAP (IL-1 Trap):

Protein-based product
    candidate designed to bind the interleukin-1 (called IL-1)
    cytokine and prevent its interaction with cell surface
    receptors. IL-1 may play an important role in a number of
    rheumatological and other diseases and disorders, including
    diseases associated with inflammation in blood vessels.

In October 2003, we announced that the IL-1 Trap demonstrated
    evidence of clinical activity and safety in patients with
    rheumatoid arthritis in a phase 2 dose-ranging study in
    approximately 200 patients. Patients treated with the
    highest dose, 100 milligrams of the IL-1 Trap, exhibited
    non-statistically significant improvements in the proportion of
    American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 responses versus
    placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. Patients treated
    with the IL-1 Trap also exhibited improvements in secondary
    endpoints of the trial. Patients in this trial experienced



•

INTERLEUKIN-4/INTERLEUKIN-13 TRAP (IL-4/13 Trap):

Protein-based product candidate designed to bind both the
    interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 (called IL-4 and IL-13)
    cytokines and prevent their interaction with cell surface
    receptors. Based on preclinical data, IL-4 and IL-13 are thought
    to play a major role in diseases such as asthma, allergic
    disorders, and other inflammatory diseases. At a scientific
    conference during the second quarter of 2004, we presented the
    results of a placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose escalation
    phase 1 trial of the IL-4/13 Trap using subcutaneous
    injections in adult subjects with mild to moderate asthma. The
    IL-4/13 Trap was generally safe and well tolerated at the doses
    tested. We plan to initiate a phase 2 trial in 2005 to
    evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of the IL-4/13 Trap
    in asthma or allergy indications.

Our Areas of Focus

Anti-Angiogenesis/Angiogenesis in Cancer, Eye Disease, and
    Other Settings: VEGF Trap and the Angiopoietins

Research.

A plentiful blood supply is required to nourish
every tissue and organ of the body. Diseases such as diabetes
and atherosclerosis wreak their havoc, in part, by destroying
blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) and
compromising blood flow. Decreases in blood flow (known as
ischemia) can result in non-healing skin ulcers and gangrene,
painful limbs that cannot tolerate exercise, loss of vision, and
heart attacks. In other cases, disease processes can damage
blood vessels by breaking down vessel walls, resulting in
defective and leaky vessels. Leaking vessels can lead to
swelling and edema, as occurs in brain tumors following ischemic
stroke, in diabetic retinopathy, and in arthritis and other
inflammatory diseases. Finally, some disease processes, such as
tumor growth, depend on the induction of new blood vessels.

In many clinical settings, positively or negatively regulating
blood vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits,
as could the repair of damaged and leaky vessels. Thus, building
new vessels, by a process known as angiogenesis, can improve
circulation to ischemic limbs and the heart, aid in healing skin
ulcers or other chronic wounds, and in establishing tissue
grafts. In addition, repairing leaky vessels can reverse
swelling and edema. Reciprocally, blocking tumor-induced
angiogenesis can blunt tumor growth.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor was the first growth factor
shown to be specific for blood vessels, by virtue of having its
receptor specifically expressed on blood vessel cells. In 1994,
we discovered a second family of angiogenic growth factors,
termed the Angiopoietins, and we have received patents covering
the members of this family. The Angiopoietins include naturally
occurring positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis, as
described in numerous scientific manuscripts published by our
scientists and their collaborators. The Angiopoietins are being
evaluated in preclinical research by us and our academic
collaborators.



Our studies have revealed that VEGF and the Angiopoietins
normally function in a coordinated and collaborative manner
during blood vessel growth. Thus, for example, the growth of new
blood vessels to nourish ischemic tissue appears to require both
these agents. In addition, Angiopoietin-1 seems to play a
critical role in stabilizing the blood vessel wall, and in
animal models administration of this growth factor can prevent
or repair leaky vessels. In terms of blocking vessel growth,
manipulation of both VEGF and Angiopoietins seems to be of value.

The approach of inhibiting angiogenesis as a mechanism of action
for an oncology medicine was further validated in February 2004,
when the FDA approved Genentech, Inc.’s VEGF inhibitor,
Avastin

tm

.
Avastin is an antibody product designed to inhibit VEGF and
interfere with the blood supply to cancerous tumors. We
exploited our Trap technology (which is described below) to
develop a protein-based blocker of VEGF, referred to as the VEGF
Trap.

Oncology.

Cancer is a heterogeneous set of diseases and
one of the leading causes of death in the developed world. A
mutation in any one of dozens of normal genes can eventually
lead a cell to become cancerous; however, a common feature of
cancer cells is that they need to get nutrients and remove waste
products, just as normal cells do. The vascular system is
designed to supply nutrients and remove waste from normal
tissues. Cancer cells can use the vascular system either by
taking over preexisting blood vessels or by promoting the growth
of new blood vessels. VEGF is secreted by many tumors to
stimulate the growth of new blood vessels to support the tumor.
Countering the effects of VEGF, thus blocking the blood supply
to tumors, has been shown to provide therapeutic benefits.

Diseases of the Eye.

Age-Related Macular Degeneration
(AMD) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) are two of the
leading causes of adult blindness in the developed world. In
both conditions, severe visual loss is caused by a combination
of retinal edema and neovascular proliferation. AMD is a leading
cause of severe visual loss in people over the age of 55 in
developed countries. It is estimated that, in the U.S., 6% of
individuals aged 65-74 and 20% of those older than 75 are
affected with AMD. DR is a major complication of diabetes
mellitus that can lead to significant vision impairment. DR is
characterized, in part, by vascular leakage, which results in
the collection of fluid in the retina. When the macula, the
central area that is responsible for fine visual acuity, is
involved, loss of visual acuity occurs. This is referred to as
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). DME is the most prevalent cause of
moderate visual loss in patients with diabetes.

VEGF both stimulates angiogenesis and increases vascular
permeability, has been shown in preclinical studies to be a
major pathogenic factor in both DR and AMD, and is believed to
be involved in other medical problems affecting the eyes.
Counteracting the effects of VEGF may provide a significant
therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from these disorders.

Clinical Development.

We discovered and are developing a
protein-based product candidate designed to bind to VEGF called
the VEGF Trap. As described above, we are currently developing
the VEGF Trap in cancer indications in collaboration with
sanofi-aventis. We have the exclusive right to develop and
commercialize the VEGF Trap for the treatment of eye diseases
utilizing local delivery to the eye, such as through
intravitreal injections.

Trap Technology and Additional Traps

Research.

Our research on ciliary neurotrophic factor, or
CNTF, led to the discovery that CNTF, although it is a
neurotrophic factor, belongs to the “superfamily” of
signaling molecules called cytokines. Cytokines are soluble
proteins secreted by the cells of the body. In many cases,
cytokines act as messengers to help regulate immune and
inflammatory responses. In excess, cytokines can be harmful and
have been linked to a variety of diseases. Blocking cytokines
and growth factors is a proven therapeutic approach with a
number of medicines or product candidates already approved or in
clinical development. The cytokine superfamily includes factors
such as erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor, and the interleukins (or ILs).

During the 1990s, our scientists made a number of breakthroughs
in understanding how receptors work for an entire family of
cytokines, which had broad relevance for many other families of
cytokines and growth



factors. Based on these findings, we developed a new class of
protein-based antagonists, called Traps, which could be designed
to target and block specific cytokines and growth factors
implicated in human disease. Examples include the VEGF Trap
(designed to block VEGF and PlGF), the IL-1 Trap (designed to
block both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta), the IL-4 Trap (designed to
block IL-4), the IL-18 Trap (designed to block IL-18), and the
IL-4/13 Trap (designed to block IL-4 and IL-13).

In preclinical studies, these Traps are more potent than other
growth factor and cytokine antagonists, potentially allowing
lower levels of these drug candidates to be used. Moreover,
because these Traps are comprised entirely of natural
human-derived protein sequences, they may be less likely to
induce an immune reaction in humans. Because pathological levels
of certain cytokines and growth factors seem to contribute to a
variety of diseases, we believe our Cytokine Traps have the
potential to be important therapeutic agents.

We have clinical programs underway for our IL-1 Trap and IL-4/13
Trap (see below) and a research program underway for an IL-18
Trap. IL-18 is thought to contribute to a number of inflammatory
and immunological diseases and disorders. We also have patents
covering additional Traps for IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-15, and
others, which are being studied in earlier stage research
programs. Our research also includes molecular and cellular
research to improve or modify Trap technology, process
development efforts to produce experimental and clinical
research supplies, and in vivo and in vitro studies to
further understand and demonstrate the efficacy of the Traps.

Clinical Development.

IL-1 Trap.

We discovered and are developing a
protein-based blocker of IL-1 called the IL-1 Trap in a number
of diseases where IL-1 may play an important role, including
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,

CIAS1

-Associated
Periodic Syndrome (CAPS), and certain systemic inflammatory
diseases. An IL-1 receptor antagonist, Kineret® (a
registered trademark of Amgen Inc.), has been approved by the
FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid
arthritis is a chronic disease in which the immune system
attacks the tissue that lines and cushions joints. Over time,
the cartilage, bone, and ligaments of the joint erode, leading
to progressive joint deformity and joint destruction, generally
in the hand, wrist, knee, and foot. Joints become painful and
swollen and motion is limited. Over two million people, 1% of
the U.S. population, are estimated to have rheumatoid
arthritis, and 10% of those eventually become disabled. Women
account for roughly two-thirds of these patients.

IL-1 also appears to play an important role in

CIAS1

-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). These rare
genetic disorders, including Familial Cold Auto-Inflammatory
Syndrome (FCAS), Muckle Wells Syndrome, and Neonatal Onset
Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder (NOMID), affect a small group
of people, estimated to be between several hundred to a few
thousand. Patients with these disorders develop fever, joint
aches, headaches, and rashes. In certain indications, these
symptoms can be extremely serious. There are no currently
approved therapies for CAPS.

IL-4/13 Trap.

We discovered both an IL-4 Trap and an
IL-4/13 Trap, which is a single molecule that can block both
interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. Antagonists for IL-4 and IL-13
may be therapeutically useful in a number of allergy and
asthma-related conditions, including as an adjunct to vaccines
where blocking IL-4 and IL-13 may help to elicit more of the
desired type of immune response to the vaccine. We are
developing the IL-4/13 Trap in settings of asthma and allergy.

It has been estimated that one in 13 Americans suffers from
allergies and one in 18 suffers from asthma. The number of
people afflicted with these diseases has been growing at a fast
rate. It is believed that IL-4 and IL-13 play a role in these
diseases. These two cytokines are essential to the normal
functioning of the immune system, creating a vital communication
link between white blood cells. In the case of asthma and
allergies, however, it is thought that excess levels of IL-4 and
IL-13 causes over activity of the immune system, which
contributes to disease initiation and progression.



Obesity and Metabolic Diseases

Food intake and metabolism are regulated by complex interactions
between diverse neural and hormonal signals that serve to
maintain an optimal balance between energy intake, storage, and
utilization. The hypothalamus, a small area at the base of the
brain, is critically involved in the integration of peripheral
signals which reflect nutritional status and neural outputs
which regulate appetite, food seeking behaviors, and energy
expenditure. Obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as
type 2 diabetes, reflect a dysregulation in the systems which
ordinarily tightly couple energy intake to energy expenditure.
Our preclinical research program encompasses the study of both
central (neuropeptide) and peripheral
(hormonal) regulators of food intake and metabolism in
health and disease. AXOKINE® is a protein-based product
candidate we discovered that is designed to act on the area of
the brain region regulating appetite and energy expenditure. We
are continuing research and pre-clinical activities in support
of AXOKINE, but no new clinical trials are planned at this time.

Muscle Atrophy and Related Disorders

Muscle atrophy occurs in many neuromuscular diseases and also
when muscle is unused, as often occurs during prolonged hospital
stays and during convalescence. Currently, physicians have few
options to treat subjects with muscle atrophy or other muscle
conditions which afflict millions of people globally. Thus, a
treatment that has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle could
have significant clinical benefit. Our muscle research program
is currently focused on conducting in vivo and in vitro
experiments with the objective of demonstrating and further
understanding the molecular pathways involved in muscle atrophy
and hypertrophy, and discovering therapeutic candidates that can
modulate these pathways. This work is being conducted in
collaboration with scientists at The Procter & Gamble
Company.

Cartilage Growth Factor System and Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis results from the wearing down of the articular
cartilage surfaces that cover joints. Thus, growth factors that
specifically act on cartilage cells could have utility in
osteoarthritis. We plan to begin clinical trials of the IL-1
Trap in osteoarthritis during 2005. In addition, our scientists
have discovered a growth factor receptor system selectively
expressed by cartilage cells, termed Regeneron Orphan Receptor 2
(ROR2). We have also demonstrated that this growth factor
receptor system is required for normal cartilage development in
mice. In addition, together with collaborators, we have
demonstrated in preclinical studies that mutations in this
growth factor receptor system cause inherited defects in
cartilage development in humans. Thus, we believe this growth
factor receptor system is a promising new target for cartilage
diseases such as osteoarthritis, but we have not yet identified
any therapeutic molecules from our research to advance to
clinical development.

Fibrosis

Fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis, result from the excess
production of fibrous extracellular matrix by certain cell
types. We and our collaborators identified orphan receptors,
termed Discoidin Domain Receptors 1 and 2 (DDR1 and DDR2), that
are expressed by the activated cell types in fibrotic disease.
Our work in this area is currently focused on determining
whether selective inhibition or activation of DDR1 and DDR2
would be beneficial in the setting of fibrotic disease. Further,
we are studying key signaling pathways which allow particular
fibrosis-inducing cells to multiply. Inhibition of such pathways
may be useful in preventing the development of fibrosis. These
research activities are being conducted in collaboration with
scientists at Procter & Gamble.

G-Protein Coupled Receptors

G-Protein Coupled Receptors have historically been among the
most useful targets for pharmaceuticals. We use a genomics
approach to discover new G-Protein Coupled Receptors and then we
characterize these receptors in our disease models by examining
their expression. Early stage research work on selected
G-Protein Coupled Receptors is being conducted in collaboration
with scientists at Procter & Gamble.



Technology Platforms

In our discovery and development activities, we utilize various
technology platforms, many of which were developed or enhanced
by us. Although the primary use of these technology platforms is
for our own research and development programs, we are also
exploring the possibility of exploiting these technologies
commercially through, for example, direct licensing or sale of
technology, or the establishment of research collaborations to
discover and develop drug targets. In December 2002, we entered
into an agreement with Serono S.A. to use our
Velocigene

tm

technology platform to provide Serono with knock-out and
transgenic mammalian models of gene function. Under the
agreement, which was amended as of January 1, 2004 to
expand the scope of services available under the Velocigene
platform, Serono has agreed to pay us up to $4.0 million
annually through December 2007, subject to early termination by
Serono with not less than nine months advance notice.

Targeted
Genomics

tm

.

In contrast to basic genomics approaches, which attempt to
identify every gene in a cell or genome, we use Targeted
Genomics approaches to identify specific genes likely to be of
therapeutic interest. These approaches do not depend on random
gene sequencing, but rather on function-based approaches to
specifically target the discovery of genes for growth factors,
peptides, and their receptors that are most likely to have use
for developing drug candidates. This technology led to our
discovery of the Angiopoietin and Ephrin growth factor families
for angiogenesis and vascular disorders, the MuSK growth factor
receptor system for muscle disorders, and the Regeneron Orphan
Receptor (ROR) growth factor receptor system that regulates
cartilage formation.

Velocigene

tm

.

A major challenge facing the biopharmaceutical industry in the
post-genomic era is the efficient assignment of function to
random gene sequences to enable the identification of validated
drug targets. One way to help determine the function of a gene
is to generate mammalian models in which the gene is removed
(referred to as “knock-out mammalian models”), or is
over-produced (referred to as “transgenic mammalian
models”), or in which a color-producing gene is substituted
for the gene of interest (referred to as “reporter knock-in
mammalian models”) to identify which cells in the model
system are expressing the gene. Until recently, technical
hurdles involved in the generation of mammalian models
restricted the ability to produce multiple models quickly and
efficiently. We have developed proprietary technology that
allows for the rapid and efficient production of models on a
high throughput scale, enabling rapid assignment of function to
gene sequences.

Designer Protein
Therapeutics

tm

.

In cases in which the natural gene product is not a product
candidate, we utilize our Designer Protein Therapeutics platform
to genetically engineer product candidates with the desired
properties. We use these technologies to develop derivatives of
growth factors and their receptors, which can allow for modified
agonistic or antagonistic properties that may prove to be
therapeutically useful. This technology platform has produced
more than 10 patented proteins, including the VEGF Trap and the
IL-1 Trap, which are currently in clinical testing, and several
others in preclinical development.

Our Collaborative Programs

We have collaboration and licensing agreements with various
companies, including sanofi-aventis, Novartis Pharma AG, and
Procter & Gamble. In addition, we conduct many research
programs in collaboration with academic partners. In the future,
we may enter into additional strategic collaborations or
licensing agreements focusing on one or more of our product
candidates, research programs, or technology platforms. Below
are summaries of our major collaborations.

The sanofi-aventis Group.

In September 2003, we
entered into a collaboration agreement with the sanofi-aventis
Group to jointly develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap in
multiple oncology, ophthalmology, and possibly other indications
throughout the world with the exception of Japan, where product
rights remain with us. Sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable
up-front payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552
newly issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock for
$45.0 million.

In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration
agreement to exclude from the scope of the collaboration the
development and commercialization of the VEGF Trap for eye
diseases through local delivery systems. In connection with the
amendment, sanofi-aventis made a one-time payment to us of



$25.0 million in January 2005 of which 50% is repayable to
sanofi-aventis following commercialization of the VEGF Trap in
accordance with the terms of the amendment.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and
sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap for disease indications included
in our collaboration. In December 2004, we earned a
$25.0 million payment from sanofi-aventis, which was
received in January 2005, upon the achievement of an early-stage
clinical milestone. We may also receive up to
$360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF
Trap indications in Europe or the United States. Regeneron has
agreed to continue to manufacture clinical supplies of the VEGF
Trap at our plant in Rensselaer, New York. Sanofi-aventis has
agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale
manufacturing capacity for the VEGF Trap.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the
collaboration becomes profitable, we will reimburse
sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses, including
50% of the $25.0 million payment received in connection
with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement,
in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
expenses and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a
faster rate at our option. Since inception of the collaboration
through December 31, 2004, we and sanofi-aventis have
incurred $86.5 million in development expenses related to
the VEGF Trap program. In addition, if the first commercial sale
of a VEGF Trap product for disease of the eye through local
delivery systems predates the first commercial sale of a VEGF
Trap product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin
reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of VEGF
Trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the
first commercial VEGF Trap sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap
development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
rights to the VEGF Trap.

Novartis.

In March 2003, we entered into a
collaboration agreement with Novartis to jointly develop and
commercialize the IL-1 Trap. Novartis made a non-refundable
up-front payment of $27.0 million and purchased 7,527,050
newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for
$48.0 million.

Development expenses incurred in 2003 were shared equally by the
Company and Novartis. We funded our share of 2003 development
expenses through loans from Novartis. In March 2004, Novartis
forgave its outstanding loans to us totaling $17.8 million,
including accrued interest, based on Regeneron’s achieving
a pre-defined development milestone, which was recognized as a
research progress payment.

In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not
to proceed with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap. In
March 2004, Novartis agreed to pay the Company
$42.75 million to satisfy its obligation to fund
development costs for the IL-1 Trap for the nine month
period following its notification and for the two months prior
to that notice. We recorded the $42.75 million as other
contract income in the first quarter of 2004. In addition, we
recognized contract research and development revenue of
$22.1 million, which represents the remaining amount of the
March 2003 up-front payment from Novartis that had previously
been deferred. Regeneron and Novartis each retain rights under
the collaboration agreement to elect to collaborate in the
future on the development and commercialization of certain other
IL-1 antagonists.

Procter & Gamble.

In May 1997, we entered
into a long-term collaboration agreement with Procter &
Gamble to discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical
products. In connection with the collaboration,
Procter & Gamble made purchases of our Common Stock of
$42.9 million in June 1997 and $17.1 million in August
2000. These purchases were in addition to a purchase by
Procter & Gamble of $10.0 million of our common
stock that was completed in March 1997. Procter &
Gamble also agreed to provide funding in support of our research
efforts related to the collaboration, of which we received
$90.8 million through December 31, 2004. From 1997 to
1999, Procter & Gamble also provided research



support for our AXOKINE program. As a result, Procter &
Gamble will be entitled to receive a small royalty on any sales
of AXOKINE.

In August 2000, Procter & Gamble made two non-recurring
research progress payments to us totaling $3.5 million.
Effective December 31, 2000, we and Procter &
Gamble entered into a new long-term collaboration agreement,
replacing the companies’ 1997 agreement. The new agreement
extended Procter & Gamble’s obligation to fund our
research under the new collaboration agreement through December
2005, with no further research obligations by either party
thereafter, and focused the companies’ collaborative
research on therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to
Procter & Gamble, including muscle atrophy and muscle
diseases, fibrotic diseases, and selected G-Protein Coupled
Receptors. For each of these program areas, the parties
contribute research activities and necessary intellectual
property rights pursuant to mutually agreed upon plans and
budgets established by operating committees. During the first
five years of the agreement, neither party may independently
perform research on targets included in the collaboration.

We and Procter & Gamble divided rights to the programs
from the 1997 collaboration agreement that are no longer part of
the companies’ collaboration. Procter & Gamble
obtained rights to certain early stage programs. We have rights
to all other research programs including exclusive rights to the
VEGF Trap, the Angiopoietins, and our Orphan Receptors (RORs).
Any product candidates that result from the new collaboration
will continue to be jointly developed and marketed worldwide,
with the companies equally sharing development costs and
profits. Under the new agreement, beginning in 2001, research
support from Procter & Gamble is $2.5 million per
quarter (plus annual adjustments for inflation) through December
2005.

The new collaboration agreement expires on the later of
December 31, 2005 or the termination of research,
development, or commercial activities relating to compounds that
meet predefined success criteria before that date. In addition,
if either party successfully develops a compound covered under
the agreement to a predefined development stage during the
two-year period following December 31, 2005, the parties
shall meet to determine whether to reconvene joint development
of the compound under the agreement. The agreement is also
subject to termination if either party enters bankruptcy,
breaches its material obligations, or undergoes a change of
control. In addition to termination rights, our new
collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble has an
“opt-out” provision, whereby a party may decline to
participate further in a research or product development
program. In such cases, the opting-out party generally does not
have any further funding obligation and will not have any rights
to the product or program in question (but may be entitled to a
royalty on any product sales). If Procter & Gamble opts
out of a product development program, and we do not find a new
partner, we would bear the full cost of the program.

Manufacturing

In 1993, we purchased our 104,000 square foot Rensselaer,
New York manufacturing facility, and in 2003 completed a
19,500 square foot expansion. This facility is used to
manufacture therapeutic candidates for our own preclinical and
clinical studies. We also use the facility to manufacture a
product for Merck & Co., Inc. under a contract that, as
amended, expires in 2006. In July 2002, we leased
75,000 square feet in a building near our Rensselaer
facility which is being used for the manufacture of Traps and
for warehouse space. At December 31, 2004, we employed 287
people at these owned and leased manufacturing facilities. As of
December 31, 2004, there were no impairment losses
associated with long-lived assets.

In 1995, we entered into a long-term manufacturing agreement
with Merck (called, as amended, the Merck Agreement) to produce
an intermediate for a Merck pediatric vaccine at our Rensselaer
facility. We agreed to modify portions of our facility for
manufacture of the Merck intermediate and to assist Merck in
securing regulatory approval for manufacturing in the Rensselaer
facility. In December 1999, we announced that the FDA had
approved us as a contract manufacturer for the Merck
intermediate. In February 2005, we and Merck extended the Merck
Agreement through October 2006 and provided Merck an
opportunity, upon twelve-months’ prior notice, to extend
the Merck Agreement for an additional year through October 2007.
Under the Merck Agreement, as amended, we are manufacturing
intermediate for Merck for seven years, with certain minimum
order quantities each year. The Merck Agreement may be
terminated at any time by Merck upon Merck’s payment of a
termination fee. Merck reimbursed us for the capital costs to
modify the facility



and for the cost of our activities performed on behalf of Merck
prior to the start of production. Merck pays an annual facility
fee of $1.0 million (plus annual adjustments for
inflation), reimburses us for certain manufacturing costs, pays
us a variable fee based on the quantity of intermediate supplied
to Merck, and makes certain additional payments. We recognized
contract manufacturing revenue related to the Merck Agreement of
$18.1 million in 2004, $10.1 million in 2003, and
$11.1 million in 2002.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a
medicine is the requirement that the prospective
manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
conform to the GMP regulations of the health authority. In
complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in
the area of production and quality control to ensure full
technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign
and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the
authority of the FDA and by other national, federal, state, and
local agencies. If our manufacturing facilities fail to comply
with FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be required
to suspend manufacturing. This will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and
cash flow.

Competition

There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
and chemical companies. Our competitors may include Genentech,
Novartis, Pfizer Inc., Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Abbott
Laboratories, sanofi-aventis, Merck, Amgen, and others. Many of
our competitors have substantially greater research,
preclinical, and clinical product development and manufacturing
capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than
we do. Our smaller competitors may also be significant if they
acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
if we achieve product commercialization, one or more of our
competitors may achieve product commercialization earlier than
we do or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely
affects our activities. Our ability to compete will depend on
how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates,
complete clinical testing and approval processes, and supply
commercial quantities of the product to the market. Competition
among product candidates approved for sale will also be based on
efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent
position, and other factors.

VEGF Trap.

Many companies are developing therapeutic
molecules designed to block the actions of VEGF specifically and
angiogenesis in general. A variety of approaches have been
employed, including antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF
receptor, small molecule antagonists to the VEGF receptor
tyrosine kinase, and other anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of
these alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to
our VEGF Trap in efficacy, side-effect profile, or form of
delivery. Additionally, many of these developmental molecules
may be at a more advanced stage of development than our product
candidate.

In particular, in February 2004, Genentech was granted approval
by the FDA to market and sell
Avastin

tm

,
a monoclonal antibody to VEGF in patients with colorectal
cancer. The marketing approval for Avastin may make it more
difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to
support the VEGF Trap oncology program. This may delay or impair
our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the VEGF
Trap. Novartis has an ongoing phase 3 clinical development
program evaluating a VEGF tyrosine kinase in different cancer
settings.

The VEGF Trap also faces significant competition in the
treatment of eye diseases. For example, Eyetech Pharmaceuticals
is collaborating with Pfizer to further develop and
commercialize a VEGF inhibitor for eye diseases, which was
recently approved by the FDA. Genentech and Novartis have a
phase 3 program nearing completion that is evaluating a
VEGF blocker in patients with eye diseases. Successful
development of these competing VEGF blockers would also make it
more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials for
the VEGF Trap in these indications and may delay or impair our
ability to successfully develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap.

IL-1 Trap/ IL-4/13 Trap.

Marketed products for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are available as
either oral or inhaled medicines, whereas our Cytokine Traps
currently are only planned for



clinical trials as injectibles. The markets for both rheumatoid
arthritis and asthma drugs are very competitive. Several new,
highly successful medicines are available for these diseases.
Examples include the TNF-antagonists Enbrel® (a registered
trademark of Amgen), Remicade® (a registered trademark of
Centocor), and Humira® (a registered trademark of Abbott),
and the IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret® (a registered
trademark of Amgen), for rheumatoid arthritis, and the
leukotriene-modifier Singulair® (a registered trademark of
Merck), as well as various inexpensive corticosteroid medicines
for asthma. The availability of highly effective FDA approved
TNF-antagonists makes it more difficult to successfully develop
the IL-1 Trap for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It
will be difficult to enroll patients with rheumatoid arthritis
to participate in clinical trials of the IL-1 Trap, which
may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop the drug
candidate. In addition, even if the IL-1 Trap is ever
approved for sale, it will be difficult for our drug to compete
against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists because doctors and
patients will have significant experience using these effective
medicines.

Other Areas.

Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies are attempting to discover new therapeutics for
indications in which we invest substantial time and resources.
Some are trying to develop small-molecule based therapeutics,
similar in at least certain respects to our program with
Procter & Gamble. In these and related areas,
intellectual property rights have been sought and certain rights
have been granted to competitors and potential competitors of
ours, and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in
such areas as a result of, among other things, our lack of
experience, trained personnel, and expertise. A number of
corporate and academic competitors are involved in the discovery
and development of novel therapeutics using tyrosine kinase
receptors, orphan receptors, and compounds that are the focus of
other research or development programs we are now conducting.
These competitors include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many
others. Many firms and entities are engaged in research and
development in the areas of cytokines, interleukins,
angiogenesis, obesity, and muscle conditions. Some of these
competitors are currently conducting advanced preclinical and
clinical research programs in these areas. These and other
competitors may have established substantial intellectual
property and other competitive advantages.

If a competitor announces a successful clinical study involving
a product that may be competitive with one of our product
candidates or an approval by a regulatory agency of the
marketing of a competitive product, such announcement may have
an adverse effect on our operations, or future prospects, or the
market price of our common stock.

We also compete with academic institutions, governmental
agencies, and other public or private research organizations,
which conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish
collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of
products that would provide royalties or other consideration for
use of their technology. These institutions are becoming more
active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements
to collect royalties or other consideration for use of the
technology that they have developed. Products developed in this
manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also
compete with others in acquiring technology from such
institutions, agencies, and organizations.

Patents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents,
maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing
on the proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to
file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and
improvements that we consider important to our business and
operations. We are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of
additional U.S. patents and patent applications. We also
rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological
innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We
or our licensors or collaborators have filed patent applications
on products and processes relating to Cytokine Traps, VEGF Trap,
AXOKINE, and Angiopoietins, as well as other technologies and
inventions in the United States and in certain foreign
countries. We intend to file additional patent applications,
when appropriate, relating to improvements in these technologies
and other specific products and processes. We plan to
aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents and
other proprietary technology.



In July 2002, we announced that Amgen and Immunex Corporation
(now part of Amgen) granted us a non-exclusive license to
certain patents and patent applications which may be used in the
development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap. The
license followed two other licensing arrangements under which we
obtained a non-exclusive license to patents owned by
ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Tularik Inc. for use in connection with
the IL-1 Trap program. These license agreements would
require us to pay royalties based on the net sales of the
IL-1 Trap if and when it is approved for sale. In total,
the royalty rate under these three agreements would be in the
mid-single digits.

In August 2003, Merck granted us a non-exclusive license to
certain patents and patent applications which may be used in the
development and commercialization of AXOKINE. In consideration
for the license, we issued to Merck 109,450 newly issued
unregistered shares of our Common Stock and in August 2004, we
made a cash payment to Merck of $0.6 million. We agreed to
make an additional payment upon receipt of marketing approval
for a product covered by the licensed patents and pay royalties,
at staggered rates in the mid-single digits, based on the net
sales, if any, of products covered by the licensed patents.

Patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in
the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are
subject to this additional uncertainty. Others may independently
develop similar products or processes to those developed by us,
duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are
issued to us, design around any products and processes covered
by our patents. We expect to continue to file product and
process patent applications with respect to our inventions.
However, we may not file any such applications or, if filed, the
patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or licensed by us
may be infringed by the products or processes of others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can
be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is
favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued to or
licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may
find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third
parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the
development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into
account patent rights of third parties.

Government Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the United States and
foreign countries is a significant factor in the research,
development, manufacture, and marketing of our product
candidates. All of our product candidates will require
regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In
particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous
preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-market approval
requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of
the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign
pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during
recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a
number of forums. The ultimate outcome and impact of such
reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted.

The activities required before a product candidate may be
marketed in the United States begin with preclinical tests.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal
studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the
product candidate and its formulations. The results of these
studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an
Investigational New Drug Application, which must be reviewed by
the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically,
clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In
Phase I, trials are conducted with a small number of
subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product
candidate. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with
subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to
provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety,
tolerability, and efficacy of different potential doses of the
product candidate. In Phase III, large-scale clinical
trials are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific
disease or disorder in order to provide enough data to
understand the efficacy and safety profile of the product
candidate, as required by the FDA. The results of the
preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product candidate
are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License
Application, or BLA, for evaluation to determine whether the
product candidate may be approved for commercial sale. In
responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval,
request additional information, or deny the application.



Any approval required by the FDA for any of our product
candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The
designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase
is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be
sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and
a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase
notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a
particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or early
stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or
efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more
broadly in humans.

Approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory
authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to
commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The
approval procedure varies among countries and may involve
additional testing, and the time required to obtain such
approval may differ from that required for FDA approval.

Various federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations
also govern or influence the research, manufacture, safety,
labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport, or
other aspects of such product candidates. The lengthy process of
seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable
statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial
resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees
to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could
adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of our products
and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and future business
will be subject to regulation under the United States Atomic
Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances
Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
national restrictions, and other present and potential future
local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had 730 full-time
employees, of whom 115 held a Ph.D. or M.D. degree or both. We
believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and
experienced personnel in a highly competitive environment;
however, competition for these personnel is intense. None of our
personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and
our management considers its relations with our employees to be
good.

Available Information

We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy
statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
or the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials
that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference

Item 2.

Properties

We conduct our research, development, manufacturing, and
administrative activities at our owned and leased facilities. We
currently lease approximately 220,000 square feet, and
sublease approximately 16,000 square feet, of laboratory
and office space in Tarrytown, New York. The sublease will
convert to a direct lease with the landlord on December 31,
2005. We own a facility in Rensselaer, New York, consisting of



two buildings totaling approximately 123,500 square feet of
research, manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. We also
lease an additional 75,000 square feet of manufacturing,
office, and warehouse space in Rensselaer.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In May 2003, purported class action securities lawsuits were
commenced against Regeneron and certain of its officers and
directors in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. A consolidated amended class action
complaint was filed in October 2003. The complaint, which
purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of
investors in our publicly traded securities between
March 28, 2000 and March 30, 2003, alleges that the
defendants misstated or omitted material information concerning
the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE, in violation of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Damages are
sought in an unspecified amount. On February 1, 2005, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated amended
complaint. We believe that the lawsuit is without merit and
intend to continue to defend the action vigorously. Because we
do not believe that a loss is probable, no legal reserve has
been established. However, we cannot assure investors that we
will be successful in defending this action, or that the amount
of any settlement or judgment in this action will not exceed the
coverage limits of our director and officer liability insurance
policies. If we are not successful in defending this action, our
business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In
addition, whether or not we are successful, the defense of this
action may divert the attention of our management and other
resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our
business.

From time to time we are a party to other legal proceedings in
the course of our business. We do not expect any other legal
proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our business or
financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and
intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the
treatment of serious medical conditions. We are currently
conducting clinical programs for the VEGF Trap, IL-1 Trap, and
IL-4/13 Trap, which are in various stages of development. In
addition to our clinical programs, we have research programs
focused on angiogenesis, metabolic diseases, muscle atrophy and
related disorders, inflammatory conditions, and other diseases
and disorders. We also use our Velocigene® and Trap
technology platforms to discover and develop new product
candidates and are developing our
Velocimmune

tm

platform to create fully human, therapeutic antibodies.

Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant
risk and expense. Since inception we have not generated any
sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
product candidates and may never receive such revenues. Before
revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates
can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a
number of hurdles which include successfully completing research
and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA
and regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving
and highly competitive, and new developments may render our
products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
2004, we had a cumulative loss of $489.8 million. In the
absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product
candidates or other sources, the amount, timing, nature, or
source of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue as
we conduct our research and development activities. We expect to
incur substantial losses over the next several years as we
continue the clinical development of the VEGF Trap, IL-1 Trap,
and IL-4/13 Trap; advance new product candidates into clinical
development from our existing research programs; continue our
research and development programs; and commercialize product
candidates that receive regulatory approval, if any.

Our activities may expand over time and may require additional
resources, and we expect our operating losses to be substantial
over at least the next several years. Our losses may fluctuate
from quarter to quarter and will depend, among other factors, on
the progress of our research and development efforts, the timing
of certain expenses, and the amount and timing of payments that
we receive from collaborators.

As a company that does not expect to generate product revenues
or profits over the next several years, management of cash flow
is extremely important. The most significant use of our cash is
for research and development activities, which include drug
discovery, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the
manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and
clinical trials. In 2004, our research and development expenses
totaled $136.1 million. We expect these expenses, exclusive
of non-cash expenses related to grants of stock options, to
increase 40-60% in 2005, depending on the progress of our
clinical programs. The principal sources of cash to-date have
been sales of common equity and convertible debt and funding
from our collaborators in the form of up-front payments,
research progress payments, payments for our research and
development activities, and purchases of our common stock. We
also receive payments for contract manufacturing.



A primary driver of our expenses is our number of full-time
employees. Our annual average headcount in 2004 was 721 compared
to 675 in 2003 and 643 in 2002. In 2005, we expect our average
headcount to increase to approximately 775, primarily to support
our research and development programs.

The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs
are significant factors that can affect our operating and
financial results. In our clinical programs, key events in 2004
and plans for 2005 are as follows:

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
with the sanofi-aventis Group to collaborate on the development
and commercialization of the VEGF Trap. Sanofi-aventis made a
non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and
purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our
Common Stock for $45.0 million.

In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration
agreement to exclude rights to develop and commercialize the
VEGF Trap for eye diseases through local delivery systems. In
connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a
$25.0 million non-refundable payment to us.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and
sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap for disease indications included
in our collaboration. In December 2004, we earned a
$25.0 million payment from sanofi-aventis, which was
received in January 2005, upon the achievement of an early-stage
clinical milestone. We may also receive up to
$360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF
Trap indications in Europe or the United States. Regeneron has
agreed to continue to manufacture clinical supplies of the VEGF



Trap at our plant in Rensselaer, New York. Sanofi-aventis has
agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale
manufacturing capacity for the VEGF Trap.

Under the collaboration agreement, agreed upon development
expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the
agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration
becomes profitable, we will reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of
the VEGF Trap development expenses, including 50% of the
$25.0 million payment received in connection with the
January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement, in
accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
expenses and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a
faster rate at our option. Since inception of the collaboration
through December 31, 2004, we and sanofi-aventis have
incurred $86.5 million in development expenses related to
VEGF Trap program. In addition, if the first commercial
sale of a VEGF Trap product for disease of the eye through local
delivery systems predates the first commercial sale of a VEGF
Trap product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin
reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of VEGF
Trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the
first commercial VEGF Trap sale under the collaboration occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the VEGF Trap
development expenses will terminate and we will retain all
rights to the VEGF Trap.

In March 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
Novartis Pharma AG to jointly develop and commercialize the IL-1
Trap. Novartis made a non-refundable payment of
$27.0 million and purchased 7,527,050 newly issued
unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $48.0 million.
In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not
to proceed with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap, and
subsequently paid us $42.75 million to satisfy its
obligation to fund development costs for the nine month period
following its notification and for the two months prior to that
notice. All rights to the IL-1 Trap have reverted to Regeneron.
Novartis and we retain rights under the collaboration agreement
to elect to collaborate in the future on the development and
commercialization of certain other IL-1 antagonists. In March
2004, we also achieved a pre-defined development milestone and
Novartis forgave all its outstanding development expense loans
to us, totaling $17.8 million.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

Revenues:

Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
consist of the following:



Our total revenue increased to $174.0 million in 2004 from
$57.5 million in 2003 primarily due to higher revenues
related to our collaboration with sanofi-aventis on the VEGF
Trap and our prior collaboration with Novartis on the IL-1 Trap.
Collaboration revenue earned from sanofi-aventis and Novartis is
comprised of contract research and development revenue and
research progress payments. Contract research and development
revenue, as detailed below, consists partly of reimbursement for
research and development expenses and partly of the recognition
of revenue related to non-refundable, up-front payments.
Non-refundable up-front payments are recorded as deferred
revenue and recognized ratably over the period over which we are
obligated to perform services in accordance with SAB 104
(see Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
Estimates). In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis provided
notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint
development of the IL-1 Trap and the $22.1 million
remaining balance of the $27.0 million up-front payment
received from Novartis in March 2003 was recognized as contract
research and development revenue.

Sanofi-aventis and Novartis contract research &
development revenues for 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

In December 2004, we earned a $25.0 million research
progress payment from sanofi-aventis, which was received in
January 2005, upon achievement of an early-stage VEGF Trap
clinical milestone. In March 2004, Novartis forgave all its
outstanding loans, including accrued interest, to Regeneron
totaling $17.8 million, based upon Regeneron’s
achieving a pre-defined IL-1 Trap development milestone. These
amounts were recognized as research progress payments in 2004.

Contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long-term
agreement with Merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at
our Rensselaer, New York facility. Contract manufacturing
revenue increased to $18.1 million in 2004 from
$10.1 million in 2003, principally due to an increase in
product shipments to Merck in 2004 compared to 2003. Revenue and
the related manufacturing expense are recognized as product is
shipped, after acceptance by Merck. Included in contract
manufacturing revenue in 2004 and 2003 are $3.6 million and
$1.7 million, respectively, of deferred revenue associated
with capital improvement reimbursements paid by Merck prior to
commencement of production. This deferred revenue is being
recognized as product is shipped to Merck based on the total
amount of product expected to be shipped over the life of the
manufacturing agreement. In February 2005, we agreed to extend
the manufacturing agreement by one year through October 2006 and
provide Merck an opportunity, upon twelve months’ prior
notice, to extend the agreement for an additional year through
October 2007.



Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses increased slightly to
$136.1 million in 2004 from $136.0 million in 2003.
The following table summarizes the major categories of our
research and development expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003:

    research, preclinical development and clinical trials, including
    related payroll and benefits, manufacturing materials and
    supplies, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our Rensselaer
    manufacturing facility.

Payroll and benefits increased $5.1 million in 2004
compared with 2003 as we added research and development
personnel to support our clinical and research programs,
especially for the VEGF Trap and IL-1 Trap. Clinical trial
expenses decreased $14.7 million in 2004 from 2003 due
primarily to the completion of the double-blind treatment
portion of our AXOKINE phase 3 clinical trial for the
treatment of obesity in 2003, the completion of other AXOKINE
trials in 2004, and the completion of our IL-4/13 Trap
phase 1 trial in 2004. These decreases were partly offset
by higher clinical trial expenses related to our VEGF Trap and
IL-1 Trap clinical programs. Clinical manufacturing costs
increased $6.6 million in 2004 compared to 2003 as we
manufactured supplies of our clinical product candidates in our
expanded Rensselaer manufacturing facility for the full year of
2004. Research and preclinical development costs increased
$3.5 million due primarily to higher preclinical
development costs related to our VEGF Trap program and higher
research-related costs for outside services in 2004 than in
2003. Occupancy and other operating costs decreased slightly by
$0.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily as a result
of lower depreciation costs due to extending the lease on our
Tarrytown, New York facilities in early 2004.

Contract Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses increased to $15.2 million
in 2004, compared to $6.7 million in 2003, primarily
because more product was shipped to Merck in 2004 and the
Company incurred unfavorable manufacturing costs, which were
expensed in the period incurred, in 2004 compared to 2003.

General and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
$17.1 million in 2004 from $14.8 million in 2003, due
primarily to a $1.4 million increase in professional fees,
principally associated with accounting and other services
related to our efforts to comply with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The
remainder of the 2004 increase was principally due to increases
in payroll and related costs associated, in part, with higher
administrative headcount in 2004 to support the Company’s
operations.

Other Income and Expense:

In the first quarter of 2004, Novartis notified us of its
decision to forego its right under our collaboration to jointly
develop the IL-1 Trap and agreed to pay us $42.75 million
to satisfy its obligation to fund development costs for the IL-1
Trap for the nine-month period following its notification and
for the two



months prior to that notice. The $42.75 million was
included in other contract income in the first quarter of 2004.

Investment income increased to $5.5 million in 2004 from
$4.5 million in 2003 due primarily to higher effective
interest rates on investment securities. Interest expense
increased slightly to $12.2 million in 2004 from
$11.9 million in 2003. Interest expense is attributable
primarily to $200.0 million of convertible notes issued in
October 2001, which mature in 2008 and bear interest at
5.5% per annum.

Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002

Revenues:

Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
consist of the following:

Our total revenue increased to $57.5 million in 2003 from
$22.0 million in 2002 primarily from the recognition of
$21.4 million of revenue related to our collaboration with
Novartis on the IL-1 Trap and $14.3 million of revenue
related to our collaboration with sanofi-aventis on the VEGF
Trap. This collaboration revenue, as detailed below, consists
partly of reimbursement for research and development expenses
and partly of the recognition of revenue related to
non-refundable up-front payments. Non-refundable up-front
payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably
over the period over which we are obligated to perform services
in accordance with SAB 104 (see Critical Accounting
Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates).

Contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long-term
agreement with Merck. Contract manufacturing revenue decreased
to $10.1 million in 2003 from $11.1 million in 2002,
due primarily to the receipt of a non-recurring
$1.0 million payment in the third quarter of 2002 related
to services we provided to Merck in prior years. Revenue and the
related manufacturing expense are recognized as product is
shipped, after acceptance by Merck. Included in contract
manufacturing revenue in 2003 and 2002 are $1.7 million and
$1.8 million, respectively, of deferred revenue associated
with capital improvement reimbursements paid by Merck prior to
commencement of production. This deferred revenue is being
recognized as product is shipped to Merck based on the total
amount of product expected to be shipped over the life of the
agreement.



Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses increased to
$136.0 million in 2003 from $125.0 million in 2002.

    supplies, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our Rensselaer
    manufacturing facility.

Payroll and benefits increased $2.6 million in 2003
compared with 2002 as we added research and regulatory personnel
to support our clinical and research programs. Clinical trial
expenses decreased $8.9 million in 2003 from 2002 due
primarily to the completion of the double-blind treatment
portion of the AXOKINE phase 3 trial in January of 2003.
Clinical manufacturing costs increased $12.5 million in
2003 compared to 2002. In 2003 we completed an expansion to our
Rensselaer, New York plant, and leased additional warehouse and
manufacturing facilities nearby, to increase our capacity to
manufacture supplies of our product candidates. As a result, we
added manufacturing personnel, purchased more materials and
supplies, and incurred higher depreciation and occupancy costs
for our manufacturing facilities in 2003 compared to 2002.
Research and preclinical development costs increased
$1.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to
expense recognized in connection with a license agreement
granted to us by Merck in 2003 related to the development of
AXOKINE. Occupancy and other operating costs increased
$3.6 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to
higher costs for the full year 2003 related to leasing
additional lab and office space in Tarrytown in the third
quarter of 2002, and higher depreciation costs associated with
leasehold renovations completed in 2003.

Contract Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses increased to $6.7 million
in 2003, compared to $6.5 million in 2002, primarily
because we shipped more product to Merck.

General and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
$14.8 million in 2003 from $12.5 million in 2002, due
primarily to (i) a $1.0 million increase in payroll
related costs, (ii) a $0.8 million increase in
professional fees, principally associated with legal expenses
for general corporate matters and the collaborations with
sanofi-aventis and Novartis, and (iii) a $0.5 million
increase in operating expenses including rent, utilities,
supplies, and insurance.

Other Income and Expense:

Investment income decreased to $4.5 million in 2003 from
$9.5 million in 2002 due primarily to lower effective
interest rates on investment securities. In addition, our levels
of interest-bearing investments were lower for most of 2003 as
we funded our operations. Interest expense was
$11.9 million in both 2003 and 2002.



Interest expense is attributable primarily to
$200.0 million of convertible notes issued in October 2001,
which mature in 2008 and bear interest at 5.5% per annum.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our operations
primarily through offerings of our equity securities, a private
placement of convertible debt, revenue earned under our past and
present research and development and contract manufacturing
agreements, including our agreements with Aventis, Novartis,
Procter & Gamble, and Merck, and investment income.

Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

Cash Used in Operations:

At December 31, 2004, we had $348.9 million in cash,
cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared with
$366.6 million, which included $10.9 million of
restricted marketable securities, at December 31, 2003. In
January 2005, we received two $25.0 million payments from
sanofi-aventis. One payment was related to a VEGF Trap clinical
milestone that was earned in 2004. The second payment related to
changes to our collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis that
were made in January 2005. Restricted marketable securities
consisted of pledged U.S. government securities which were
sufficient upon receipt of scheduled principal and interest
payments to provide for the payment in full of the interest
payments on the convertible senior subordinated notes through
October 2004.

Net cash used in operations was $16.9 million in 2004
compared to $6.1 million in 2003. The increase in cash used
in operations during 2004 was primarily due to the 2003 receipt
of non-refundable up-front payments associated with the
sanofi-aventis and Novartis collaborations, offset in part by
higher 2004 receipts from (i) sanofi-aventis for contract
research and development revenue and (ii) Novartis for its
$42.75 million payment to us following its first quarter
2004 decision to forego its right under our collaboration to
jointly develop the IL-1 Trap. The majority of cash used in
operations in both 2004 and 2003 was to fund research and
development, primarily related to our VEGF Trap and IL-1 Trap
programs.

In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
with sanofi-aventis to jointly develop and commercialize the
VEGF Trap. Sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable up-front payment
of $80.0 million which was recorded to deferred revenue and
is being recognized as contract research and development revenue
ratably over the period during which we expect to perform
services. In 2004 and 2003, we recognized $10.5 million and
$3.6 million of revenue, respectively, related to this
up-front payment and we anticipate, based on current VEGF Trap
product development plans, that we will recognize approximately
$9.4 million of revenue over each of the next 7 years.
Sanofi-aventis has agreed to fund all agreed upon development
expenses incurred by both companies in connection with
indications included in our collaboration during the term of the
agreement. Sanofi-aventis funded $67.8 million of our VEGF
Trap development costs in 2004 and $10.7 million in 2003,
of which $13.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively,
were included in accounts receivable as of December 31,
2004 and 2003. In addition, in December 2004 we earned a
$25.0 million milestone payment from sanofi-aventis, which
was also included in accounts receivable at December 31,
2004.

In March 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap.
Novartis made a non-refundable up-front payment of
$27.0 million which was initially recorded to deferred
revenue. In 2003, we recognized $4.9 million of revenue
related to this up-front payment. In the first quarter of 2004,
Novartis provided notice of its intention not to proceed with
the joint development of the IL-1 Trap and the remaining balance
of the $27.0 million up-front payment, or
$22.1 million, was recognized as contract research and
development revenue. As described above, we also received a
$42.75 million payment from Novartis in the first quarter
of 2004 which was recognized as other contract income. In
addition, in March 2004, Novartis forgave all its outstanding
loans, including accrued interest, to Regeneron totaling
$17.8 million, based upon Regeneron’s achieving a
pre-defined IL-1 Trap development milestone. Development
expenses incurred during 2003 were shared equally by Regeneron
and Novartis. In 2003, Novartis agreed to reimburse us for
$16.5 million of our IL-Trap development costs, of which
$3.2 million was included in accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2003.



In 2003, we recorded a non-cash expense of $1.5 million
associated with the issuance of our Common Stock in connection
with a license agreement entered into with Merck.

In both 2004 and 2003, we made two semi-annual interest payments
totaling $11.0 million per year on our convertible senior
subordinated notes.

Cash Used in Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities decreased to
$4.6 million in 2004 from $63.8 million in 2003, due
primarily to a decrease in purchases of marketable securities,
net of sales or maturities. In 2004, purchases of marketable
securities exceeded sales or maturities by $9.5 million,
whereas in 2003, purchases of marketable securities exceeded
sales or maturities by $45.2 million. In addition, payments
for capital expenditures decreased $23.5 million in 2004
compared to 2003, due primarily to the completion of our
Rensselaer plant expansion in 2003.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities:

Cash provided by financing activities decreased to
$4.4 million in 2004 from $108.2 million in 2003, due
primarily to the sale of Common Stock to sanofi-aventis and
Novartis in 2003 in association with the collaboration
agreements. Sanofi-aventis purchased 2,799,552 newly issued
unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $45.0 million.
Novartis purchased 7,527,050 newly issued unregistered shares of
our Common Stock for $48.0 million. In addition, in
accordance with our collaboration agreement with Novartis, we
elected to fund our share of 2003 IL-1 Trap development expenses
through a loan from Novartis that was forgiven in March 2004
upon Regeneron’s achieving a pre-defined IL-1 Trap
development milestone. As of December 31, 2003, we had
drawn $13.7 million, excluding interest, against this loan
facility and we drew an additional $3.8 million during the
first quarter of 2004 for expenses incurred during 2003.

Sanofi-aventis Agreement:

In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration
agreement to exclude rights to develop and commercialize the
VEGF Trap for eye diseases through local delivery systems. In
connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a
$25.0 million non-refundable payment to us.

Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and
sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap for disease indications included
in our collaboration. In December 2004, we earned a
$25.0 million payment from sanofi-aventis, which was
received in January 2005, upon achievement of an early-stage
clinical milestone. We may also receive up to
$360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF
Trap indications in Europe or the United States.

We have agreed to continue to manufacture clinical supplies of
the VEGF Trap at our plant in Rensselaer, New York.
Sanofi-aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing
commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the VEGF Trap. Under
the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon development
expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the
agreement, including costs associated with the manufacture of
clinical drug supply, will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the
collaboration becomes profitable, we will reimburse
sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses, including
50% of the $25.0 million payment received in connection
with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement,
in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
expenses and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a
faster rate at our option. In addition, if the first commercial
sale of a VEGF Trap product for diseases of the eye through
local delivery systems predates the first commercial sale of a
VEGF Trap product under the collaboration, we will begin
reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of VEGF
Trap development expenses commencing two years after such
initial commercialization outside the collaboration in
accordance with a formula until the first commercial VEGF Trap
sale under the collaboration occurs. Since inception of the
collaboration agreement through December 31, 2004, we
incurred and were subsequently reimbursed by sanofi-aventis for
$78.1 million in development expenses related to the VEGF
Trap



program. In addition to expenses incurred by us, sanofi-aventis
has incurred $8.4 million in development expenses through
December 31, 2004 related to the VEGF Trap program.

We and sanofi-aventis plan to initiate multiple clinical studies
in 2005 to evaluate the VEGF Trap as both a single-agent and in
combination with other therapies in various cancer indications.
During the third quarter of 2004, the FDA granted Fast Track
designation to the VEGF Trap for a specific niche cancer
indication. As a result of the FDA’s decision, we and
sanofi-aventis plan to initiate a clinical trial in that
indication in 2005.

Merck License Agreement:

In August 2003, Merck granted to us a non-exclusive license to
certain patents and patent applications which may be used in the
development and commercialization of AXOKINE. As consideration,
we issued to Merck 109,450 newly issued unregistered shares of
our Common Stock (the Merck Shares), valued at $1.5 million
based on the fair market value of shares of our Common Stock on
the agreement’s effective date. In August 2004, we
repurchased from Merck, and subsequently retired, the Merck
Shares for $0.9 million, based on the fair market value of
the shares on August 19, 2004. We also made a cash payment
of $0.6 million to Merck as required under the license
agreement. The agreement requires us to make an additional
payment to Merck upon receipt of marketing approval for a
product covered by the licensed patents. In addition, we would
be required to pay royalties, at staggered rates in the
mid-single digits, based on the net sales of products covered by
the licensed patents.

Convertible Debt:

In 2001, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private
placement and received proceeds, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discount and out-of pocket expenses, of
$192.7 million. The notes bear interest at 5.5% per
annum, payable semi-annually and mature in 2008. The notes are
convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion
price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances. We may redeem some or all
of the notes if the closing price of our Common Stock has
exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in effect for a
specified period of time.

As part of this transaction, we pledged $31.6 million of
U.S. government securities which was sufficient upon
receipt of scheduled principal and interest payments to provide
for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest
payments on the notes when due, the last of which was paid in
October 2004.

Capital Expenditures:

Our additions to property, plant, and equipment totaled
$6.0 million in 2004, $16.9 million in 2003, and
$45.9 million in 2002, including a total of
$48.0 million in 2002 and 2003 related to the expansion of
our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York, which was
completed in 2003. In 2005, we expect to incur approximately
$10 million in capital expenditures which primarily
consists of equipment for our expanded manufacturing, research,
and development activities.

Funding Requirements:

Our total expenses for research and development from inception
through December 31, 2004 have been approximately
$857 million. We have entered into various agreements
related to our activities to develop and commercialize product
candidates and utilize our technology platforms, including
collaboration agreements, such as with sanofi-aventis, Novartis,
and Procter & Gamble, and agreements to use our
Velocigene

tm

technology platform, such as with Serono S.A. We incurred
expenses associated with these agreements, which include an
allocable portion of general and administrative costs, of
$75.3 million, $56.0 million and $11.9 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

We expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements
primarily for research and development activities (including
preclinical and clinical testing). We currently anticipate that
approximately 55%-65% of our expenditures for 2005 will be
directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of
product



candidates, including the VEGF Trap, IL-1 Trap, and IL-4/13
Trap; approximately 20%-30% of our expenditures for 2005 will be
applied to our basic research activities and the continued
development of our novel technology platforms; and the remainder
of our expenditures for 2005 will be used for capital
expenditures and general corporate purposes.

In connection with our funding requirements, the following table
summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31,
2004 for leases and long-term debt. None of these obligations
extend beyond 5 years.

Excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities, real

    $6.0 million.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend on various
factors, including the status of competitive products, the
success of our research and development programs, the potential
future need to expand our professional and support staff and
facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual
property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any
of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent,
and success of any collaborative research and development
collaborations (including those with sanofi-aventis and
Procter & Gamble). Clinical trial costs are dependent,
among other things, on the size and duration of trials, fees
charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators
and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product
candidate for use in the trials, supplies, laboratory tests, and
other expenses. The amount of funding that will be required for
our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research
and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials,
regulatory requirements, the clinical trials underway plus
additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the
various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described
above. In the future, if we are able to successfully develop,
market, and sell certain of our product candidates, we may be
required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits
generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and
licensing agreements. Also under the terms of the sanofi-aventis
collaboration agreement, if the collaboration becomes
profitable, we will reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50 percent
of the VEGF Trap development expenses, including 50% of the
$25.0 million payment received in connection with amending
our collaboration agreement in January 2005, in accordance with
a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our
share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our
option. In addition, if the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap
product for diseases of the eye through local delivery systems
predates the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product under
the collaboration, we will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for
up to $7.5 million of VEGF Trap development expenses
commencing two years after such initial commercialization
outside the collaboration in accordance with a formula until the
first commercial VEGF Trap sale under the collaboration occurs.
Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of the
VEGF Trap development expenses will terminate and we will
retain all rights to the VEGF Trap.

We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution,
defense, and enforcement of patent and other intellectual
property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of
patent filings and prosecutions in the United States and foreign
countries.

We believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to
meet operating needs through at least mid-2007. However, this is
a forward-looking statement based on our current operating plan,
and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that
would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before
such time. If there is insufficient capital to fund all of our
planned operations and activities, we believe we would
prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical
development of our product candidates. We



have no off-balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the
obligations of any other entity. As of December 31, 2004,
we had no established banking arrangements through which we
could obtain short-term financing or a line of credit. In the
event we need additional financing for the operation of our
business, we will consider collaborative arrangements and
additional public or private financing, including additional
equity financing. In January 2005, we filed a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 to sell, in one or more offerings, up
to $200.0 million of equity or debt securities, together or
separately, which registration statement was declared effective
in February 2005. However, there is no assurance that we will be
able to complete any such offerings of securities. Factors
influencing the availability of additional financing include our
progress in product development, investor perception of our
prospects, and the general condition of the financial markets.
We may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new
collaborative arrangements or additional public or private
offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our
capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or
eliminate certain of our research and development activities or
future operations. This could harm our business.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
Estimates

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenue from contract research and development and
research progress payments in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104) and Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

(EITF 00-21). During the third quarter of
2003, we elected to change the method we use to recognize
revenue under SAB 104 related to non-refundable
collaborator payments, including up-front licensing payments,
payments for development activities, and research progress
(milestone) payments, to the Substantive Milestone Method,
adopted retroactively to January 1, 2003. Under this
method, we recognize revenue from non-refundable up-front
license payments, not tied to achieving a specific performance
milestone, ratably over the period over which we expect to
perform services. The period over which we expect to perform
services is estimated based on product development plans. These
estimates are updated based on the results and progress of
clinical trials and drug production and revisions to these
estimates could result in changes to the amount of revenue
recognized each year in the future. In addition, if a
collaborator terminates the agreement in accordance with the
terms of the contract, we would recognize the remainder of the
up-front payment at the time of the termination. Payments for
development activities are recognized as revenue as earned,
ratably over the period of effort. Substantive at-risk milestone
payments, which are based on achieving a specific performance
milestone, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is
achieved and the related payment is due, provided there is no
future service obligation associated with that milestone.
Previously, we had recognized revenue from non-refundable
collaborator payments based on the percentage of costs incurred
to date, estimated costs to complete, and total expected
contract revenue. However, the revenue recognized was limited to
the amount of non-refundable payments received. The change in
accounting method was made because we believe that it better
reflects the substance of our collaborative agreements and is
more consistent with current practices in the biotechnology
industry.

In connection with our VEGF Trap collaboration agreement with
sanofi-aventis, in September 2003, we received a non-refundable
up-front payment of $80.0 million which was recorded to
deferred revenue and is being recognized as contract research
and development revenue ratably over the period over which we
are obligated to perform services. In the fourth quarter of
2004, we revised our estimate based on current VEGF Trap product
development plans and extended the period over which we expect
to be obligated to perform services under the collaboration by
one year. As a result, we anticipate that we will recognize
approximately $9.4 million of revenue related to the
sanofi-aventis $80.0 million up-front payment over each of
the next 7 years. Also, in connection with our
collaboration agreement with Novartis, in the first quarter of
2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not to proceed
with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap. Accordingly, the
remaining balance of the $27.0 million up-front payment, or
$22.1 million, was recognized as contract research and
development revenue.



Recognition of Deferred Revenue Related to Contract
    Manufacturing Agreement:

We have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with
Merck under which we manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our
Rensselaer, New York facility and perform services. We recognize
contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the
product is tested and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping
Point) to, Merck, and as services are performed. In connection
with the agreement, we agreed to modify portions of our
Rensselaer facility to manufacture Merck’s vaccine
intermediate and Merck agreed to reimburse us for the related
capital costs. These capital cost payments were deferred and are
recognized as revenue as product is shipped to Merck, based upon
our estimate of Merck’s order quantities each year through
the expected end of the agreement which, for 2004 and prior
years, was October 2005. Since we commenced production of the
vaccine intermediate in November 1999, our estimates of
Merck’s order quantities each year have not been materially
different from Merck’s actual orders.

In February 2005, we and Merck amended our contract
manufacturing agreement by extending its term by one year
through October 2006. In addition, we provided Merck the
opportunity, upon twelve months’ prior notice, to extend
the agreement for an additional year through October 2007. As a
result, we will recognize the remaining deferred balance of
Merck’s capital cost payments as of December 31, 2004,
or $2.7 million, as revenue as product is shipped to Merck,
based upon our revised estimate of Merck’s order quantities
through October 2006.

Clinical Trial Accrual Estimates:

For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial
costs, which are included in research and development expenses,
are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in
the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and the
period over which clinical investigators or contract research
organizations are expected to provide services. We believe that
this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts
we expend on a clinical trial. During the course of a trial, we
adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual
results differ from our estimates. No material adjustments to
our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.

Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

6-30 years

Leasehold improvements

Life of lease

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

In some situations, the life of the asset may be extended or
shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe
that the estimated life of the asset has changed. The life of
leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of
lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in the estimated
lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the
amount of depreciation recognized in future periods. Costs of
construction of certain long-lived assets include capitalized
interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of
the related asset.

Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In April 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Statement
No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the
Two — Class Method under FASB Statement
No. 128, Earnings per Share

(EITF 03-6).
EITF 03-6 addresses a number of questions regarding the
computation of earnings per share (EPS) by companies that
have issued securities other than common stock that
contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends



and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends
on its common stock. EITF 03-6 defines participation rights
based solely on whether the holder would be entitled to receive
any dividends if the entity declared them during the period and
requires the use of the two-class method for computing basic EPS
when participating convertible securities exist. In addition,
EITF 03-6 expands the use of the two-class method to
encompass other forms of participating securities and is
effective for fiscal periods beginning after March 31,
2004. Since we have no participating securities, our adoption of
EITF 03-6 did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB 43,
Chapter 4

(SFAS No. 151).
SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and
wasted material by requiring that those items be recognized as
current-period charges in all circumstances.
SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. We believe that the future adoption of
SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on our
financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R is a revision
of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and its related
implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R establishes
standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services.
SFAS No. 123R focuses primarily on accounting for
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions, and requires the recognition
of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of
the share-based payment (including stock options and restricted
stock) issued to employees. SFAS No. 123R is effective
for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We
currently intend to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective
July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. Under
the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized
beginning with the effective date based on (a) the requirements
of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after
the effective date and (b) the requirements of SFAS No. 123
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date
of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective
date. Although the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R
has not yet been quantified, we believe that the future adoption
of this standard will have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

(SFAS No. 153). SFAS No. 153 eliminates an
exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets
under APB Opinion No. 29, and replaces it with a general
exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is to be applied
prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges
occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.
We believe that the future adoption of SFAS No. 153
will not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Risk Factors

We operate in an environment that involves a number of
significant risks and uncertainties. We caution you to read the
following risk factors, which have affected, and/or in the
future could affect, our business, operating results, financial
condition, and cash flows. The risks described below include
forward-looking statements, and actual events and our actual
results may differ substantially from those discussed in these
forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
may also impair our business operations. Furthermore, additional
risks and uncertainties are discussed elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and should be considered by our
investors.

Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for
Additional Financing

We have had a history of operating losses and we may never
    achieve profitability. If we continue to incur operating losses,
    we may be unable to continue our operations.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31,
2004, we had a cumulative loss of $489.8 million. If we
continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a
profitable company, we may be



unable to continue our operations. We have no products that are
available for sale and do not know when we will have products
available for sale, if ever. In the absence of revenue from the
sale of products or other sources, the amount, timing, nature or
source of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue as
we conduct our research and development activities. We currently
receive contract manufacturing revenue from our agreement with
Merck and contract research and development revenue from our
agreements with Procter & Gamble and Serono. Our
agreements with Procter & Gamble and Serono may expire
in 2005. Our agreement with Merck is scheduled to expire before
the end of 2006, unless extended for one additional year by
Merck. We can provide no assurance that all or any of these
agreements will be extended. Failure to extend these agreements
may negatively impact our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

We will need additional funding in the future, which may
    not be available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce
    or eliminate our product development programs or
    commercialization efforts.

We will need to expend substantial resources for research and
development, including costs associated with clinical testing of
our product candidates. We believe our existing capital
resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at
least mid-2007; however, our projected revenue may decrease or
our expenses may increase and that would lead to our capital
being consumed significantly before such time. We will likely
require additional financing in the future and we may not be
able to raise such additional funds. If we are able to obtain
additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible
debt securities, such sales may be dilutive to our shareholders.
Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain
assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business
activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may
contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders.
If we are unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the
development of our product candidates, we may face delay,
reduction or elimination of our research and development
programs or preclinical or clinical trials, in which case our
business, financial condition or results of operations may be
materially harmed.

We have a significant amount of debt and may have
    insufficient cash to satisfy our debt service and repayment
    obligations. In addition, the amount of our debt could impede
    our operations and flexibility.

We have a significant amount of convertible debt and semi-annual
interest payment obligations. This debt, unless converted to
shares of our common stock, will mature in October 2008. We may
be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain
funds necessary to make required payments on our debt. Even if
we are able to meet our debt service obligations, the amount of
debt we already have could hurt our ability to obtain any
necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes. In
addition, our debt obligations could require us to use a
substantial portion of cash to pay principal and interest on our
debt, instead of applying those funds to other purposes, such as
research and development, working capital, and capital
expenditures.

We intend to adopt, effective January 1, 2005, the
    fair market value based method of accounting for stock-based
    employee compensation. This is expected to materially increase
    our non-cash compensation expenses in our Statement of
    Operations commencing in 2005, primarily due to compensation
    costs related to stock options.

We intend to adopt, effective January 1, 2005, the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation under the provisions of SFAS Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(SFAS No. 123),

Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation

, as modified by Statement of Accounting
Standards No. 148 (SFAS No. 148),

Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure

, using the modified prospective method.
SFAS Nos. 123/148 require that compensation expense in an
amount equal to the fair market value of the share-based payment
(including stock option awards) be recognized over the vesting
period of the awards. We expect to begin recognizing this
compensation cost in the first quarter of 2005. The impact of
adopting SFAS Nos. 123/148 in 2005 has not yet been
quantified. However, had we adopted SFAS Nos. 123/148
effective January 1, 2004, our net income would have
decreased by approximately $33.6 million and our basic net
income per share would have decreased from $0.75 per share
to $0.15 per share.



In addition, in December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which is a
revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of compensation
expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
payments (including stock options) issued to employees. We will
be required to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective for the
quarter beginning July 1, 2005. The impact of adopting
SFAS No. 123R has not yet been quantified.

The expected negative impact on our income (loss) as a result of
adopting SFAS No. 123/148 commencing January 1,
2005, and subsequently adopting SFAS No. 123R
commencing July 1, 2005, may materially negatively affect
our stock price.

Risks Related to Development of Our Product Candidates

Successful development of any of our product candidates is
    highly uncertain.

Only a small minority of all research and development programs
ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We have
never developed a drug that has been approved for marketing and
sale, and we may never succeed in developing an approved drug.
Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness of
any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the
necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial
success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their
acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party
payors and on our and our partners’ ability to successfully
manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Our
product candidates are delivered either by intravenous,
intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are generally
less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery.
If our products are not successfully commercialized, we will not
be able to recover the significant investment we have made in
developing such products and our business would be severely
harmed.

Clinical trials required for our product candidates are
    expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is highly
    uncertain. If any of our drug trials are delayed or achieve
    unfavorable results, we will have to delay or may be unable to
    obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.

We must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates
before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell
them. We need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and
human clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a lengthy,
time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and trials
may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including,
among others, failure of the product candidate to demonstrate
safety or efficacy, the development of serious or
life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or
connected with exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in
enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial, lack
of sufficient supplies of the product candidate, and the failure
of clinical investigators, trial monitors and other consultants,
or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol. A
clinical trial may fail because it did not include a sufficient
number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or
reach statistical significance. A clinical trial may also fail
because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in the
trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal
effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting. For
example, we intend to study higher doses of the IL-1 Trap
after a previous phase 2 trial of the IL-1 Trap in subjects
with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its primary
endpoint. Additional clinical trial risks and examples of our
prior clinical trials which did not achieve favorable results
are described in the risk factor below entitled “

A
previous phase 3 study evaluating AXOKINE demonstrated
modest average weight loss over a 12-month period. In addition,
a completed phase 2 study evaluating the IL-1 Trap in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its primary
endpoint.

”

We will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test
favorably and either conduct new trials, which are expensive and
time consuming, or abandon the drug development program. Even if
we obtain positive results from preclinical or clinical trials,
we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Many
companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including us, have
suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after
promising results have been obtained in earlier trials. The
failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and
effectiveness for the desired indication(s) could harm the
development of the product candidate(s), and our business,
financial condition, and results of operations may be materially
harmed.



The development of serious or life-threatening side
    effects with any of our product candidates would lead to delay
    or discontinuation of development, which could severely harm our
    business.

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes
in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts,
to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine
whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these
conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have
been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our
product candidates. Although our current drug candidates
appeared to be generally well tolerated in clinical trials
conducted to date, it is possible as we test any of them in
larger, longer, and more extensive clinical programs, illnesses,
injuries, and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials,
as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in
smaller previous trials, will be reported by patients. Many
times, side effects are only detectable after investigational
drugs are tested in large scale, phase 3 clinical trials
or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients
after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that
any of our product candidates has many side effects or causes
serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the
product candidate may fail or be delayed, which would severely
harm our business.

Our VEGF Trap is being studied for the potential treatment of
certain types of cancer and diseases of the eye. There are many
potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade
of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. These risks,
based on the clinical and preclinical experience of systemically
delivered VEGF inhibitors, including the VEGF Trap, include
bleeding, hypertension, and proteinuria. These serious side
effects and other serious side effects have been reported in our
VEGF Trap studies in cancer and diseases of the eye. In
addition, patients given infusions of any protein, including the
VEGF Trap delivered through intravenous administration, may
develop severe hypersensitivity reactions, referred to as
infusion reactions. These and other complications or side
effects could harm the development of the VEGF Trap for either
the treatment of cancer or diseases of the eye.

Although the IL-1 Trap was generally well tolerated and was not
associated with any drug-related serious adverse events in the
phase 2 rheumatoid arthritis study completed in 2003,
safety or tolerability concerns may arise as we test higher
doses of the IL-1 Trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and
other inflammatory diseases and disorders. Like TNF-antagonists
such as Enbrel® (a registered trademark of Amgen) and
Remicade® (a registered trademark of Centocor), the IL-1
Trap affects the immune defense system of the body by blocking
some of its functions. Therefore, there may be an increased risk
for infections to develop in patients treated with the IL-1
Trap. In addition, patients given infusions of the IL-1 Trap
delivered through intravenous administration have developed
hypersensitivity reactions, referred to as infusion reactions.
These and other complications or side effects could harm the
development of the IL-1 Trap.

Our product candidates in development are recombinant
    proteins that could cause an immune response, resulting in the
    creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the
    therapeutic protein.

In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and
regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the
administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an
immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against
the therapeutic protein. The antibodies can have no effect or
can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or
require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic
effect. In some cases, the antibody can cross react with the
patient’s own proteins, resulting in an
“auto-immune” type disease. Whether antibodies will be
created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical
experiments, and their appearance is often delayed, so that
there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not
be created at a later date — in some cases even after
pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Approximately
two-thirds of the subjects who received AXOKINE in the completed
phase 3 study developed neutralizing antibodies. In
addition, subjects who received the IL-1 Trap in clinical
trials have developed antibodies. It is possible that as we test
the VEGF Trap in different patient populations and larger
clinical trials, subjects given the VEGF Trap will develop
antibodies to the product candidate.



A previous phase 3 study evaluating AXOKINE
    demonstrated modest average weight loss over a 12-month period.
    In addition, a completed phase 2 study evaluating the
    IL-1 Trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis failed to
    achieve its primary endpoint.

In March 2003, we reported data from the 12-month treatment
period of our initial phase 3 pivotal trial of AXOKINE.
Although the phase 3 study met its primary endpoints and
individuals achieved a medically meaningful weight loss, the
average weight loss was small and limited by the development of
antibodies.

In October 2003, we reported results from the first phase 2
trial of our IL-1 Trap in rheumatoid arthritis. We plan to
conduct large-scale rheumatoid arthritis trials of the IL-1 Trap
in a larger patient population, testing higher doses than were
tested in the previous phase 2 trial for a longer period of
time. We plan to study higher doses of the IL-1 Trap through
subcutaneous injections and intravenous delivery. However,
higher doses may not lead to better results than were
demonstrated in the previous phase 2 trial. In addition,
safety or tolerability concerns may arise which limit our
ability to deliver higher doses of the IL-1 Trap to patients.
The dose levels that will be tested are substantially higher
than the dose levels of other biological therapeutics currently
approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The higher
doses may affect the safety and/or tolerability of the
IL-1 Trap, which may limit its commercial potential if the
product candidate is ever approved for marketing and sale.

We intend to study our lead product candidates, the VEGF Trap
and IL-1 Trap, in a wide variety of indications in
so-called “proof of concept” studies. We intend to
study the VEGF Trap in a variety of cancer settings and
ophthalmologic indications and the IL-1 Trap in a wide variety
of inflammatory disorders. The specific indications were
selected based on available pre-clinical and clinical data from
medical publications, our product candidates, and competitive
agents. The purpose of these exploratory “proof of
concept” studies is to identify what diseases, if any, are
best suited for treatment with these product candidates.
However, it is likely that our product candidates will not
demonstrate the requisite efficacy and/or safety profile to
support continued development for most of the indications that
are to be studied in these “proof of concepts”
studies. In fact, our product candidates may not demonstrate the
requisite efficacy and safety profile to support the continued
development for any of the indications studied in these
early-stage trials.

Regulatory and Litigation Risks

If we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product
    candidates, we will not be able to market or sell them.

We cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval.
If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our
product candidates, the value of our company and our results of
operations will be harmed. In the United States, we must obtain
and maintain approval from the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for each drug we intend to sell.
Obtaining FDA approval is typically a lengthy and expensive
process, and approval is highly uncertain. Foreign governments
also regulate drugs distributed in their country and approval in
any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process, and
approval is highly uncertain. None of our product candidates has
ever received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the
United States or any other country. We may never receive
regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

If the testing or use of our products harms people, we
    could be subject to costly and damaging product liability
    claims. We could also face costly and damaging claims arising
    from employment law, securities law, environmental law or other
    applicable laws governing our operations.

The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use
in people expose us to product liability risk. We are currently
involved in a product liability lawsuit brought by a subject who
participated in a clinical trial of one of our drug candidates.
Any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who sign up
for our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the
cost of litigation. Our product liability insurance may not
cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any
liability arising from any such litigation. Moreover, we may not
have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our
insurance on acceptable terms.



In May 2003, purported class action securities lawsuits were
commenced against us and certain of our officers and directors
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. A consolidated amended class action complaint was
filed in October 2003. The complaint, which purports to be
brought on behalf of a class consisting of investors in our
publicly traded securities between March 28, 2000 and
March 30, 2003, alleges that the defendants misstated or
omitted material information concerning the safety and efficacy
of AXOKINE, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder. Damages are sought in an unspecified
amount. On February 1, 2005, the United States District
Court of the Southern District for New York denied our motion to
dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. We believe the
lawsuit is without merit and intend to continue to defend the
action vigorously. Because we do not believe that a loss is
probable, no legal reserve has been established. However, we
cannot assure investors that we will be successful in defending
this action, or that the amount of any settlement or judgment in
this action will not exceed the coverage limits of our director
and officers liability insurance policies. If we are not
successful in defending this action, our business and financial
condition could be adversely affected. In addition, whether or
not we are successful, the defense of this action may divert
attention of our management and other resources that would
otherwise be engaged in running our business.

Our operations may involve hazardous materials and are
    subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and
    regulations. We may incur substantial liability arising from our
    activities involving the use of hazardous materials.

As a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing
operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health,
and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the
use of hazardous materials. Our research and development and
manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of
chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous
materials. The cost of compliance with environmental, health,
and safety regulations is substantial. If an accident involving
these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we
could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face
regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or
insurance coverage.

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties

On February 27, 2004, Novartis Pharma AG
    provided notice to us that they would not participate in the
    continued development and commercialization of the
    IL-1 Trap under our collaboration agreement. This may harm
    our ability to develop and commercialize the IL-1 Trap.

We relied heavily on Novartis to provide their expertise,
resources, funding, manufacturing capacity, clinical expertise,
and commercial infrastructure to support the IL-1 Trap program.
Novartis’ decision to withdraw from participating in the
development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap may
delay or disrupt the IL-1 Trap program. We do not have the
resources and skills to replace those of Novartis, which could
result in significant delays in the development and potential
commercialization of the IL-1 Trap. In addition, we will have to
fund the development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap
without Novartis’ long-term commitment, which will require
substantially greater expenditures on our part.

If our collaboration with sanofi-aventis for the VEGF Trap
    is terminated, our business operations and our ability to
    develop, manufacture, and commercialize the VEGF Trap in the
    time expected, or at all, would be harmed.

We rely heavily on sanofi-aventis to assist with the development
of the VEGF Trap. If the VEGF Trap program continues, we will
rely on sanofi-aventis to assist with funding the VEGF Trap
program, providing commercial manufacturing capacity, enrolling
and monitoring clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval,
particularly outside the United States, and providing sales and
marketing support. While we cannot assure you that the VEGF Trap
will ever be successfully developed and commercialized, if
sanofi-aventis does not perform its obligations in a timely
manner, or at all, our ability to develop, manufacture, and
commercialize the VEGF Trap will be significantly adversely
affected. Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate its
collaboration agreement with us at any time. If sanofi-aventis
were to terminate its collaboration agreement



with us, we might not have the resources or skills to replace
those of our partner, which could cause significant delays in
the development and/or manufacture of the VEGF Trap and result
in substantial additional costs to us. We have no sales,
marketing or distribution capabilities and would have to develop
or outsource these capabilities. Termination of the
sanofi-aventis collaboration agreement would create new and
additional risks to the successful development of the VEGF Trap.

Our collaborators and service providers may fail to
    perform adequately in their efforts to support the development,
    manufacture, and commercialization of our drug
    candidates.

We depend upon third-party collaborators, including
sanofi-aventis and service providers such as clinical research
organizations, outside testing laboratories, clinical
investigator sites, and third party manufacturers and product
packagers and labelers, to assist us in the development of our
product candidates. If any of our existing collaborators or
service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us
or does not perform its development or manufacturing services
under an agreement in a timely manner or at all, we would
experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the
development or ultimate commercialization of our product
candidates.

Risks Related to the Manufacture of Our Product Candidates

We have limited manufacturing capacity, which could
    inhibit our ability to successfully develop or commercialize our
    drugs.

Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA
requires that the facilities at which the product will be
manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing
practices, or cGMP requirements. Manufacturing product
candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is
complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our
products must be manufactured for development, following
approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with
regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. If we or any
of our product collaborators or third-party manufacturers,
fillers or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory
compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including,
among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for
a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing
approval. As a result, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations may be materially harmed.

Our manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce
sufficient quantities of product for commercial sale. We intend
to rely on our corporate collaborators, as well as contract
manufacturers, to produce the large quantities of drug material
needed for commercialization of our products. We rely entirely
on third party manufacturers for filling and finishing services.
We will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver
material on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory
requirements. If we are unable to supply sufficient material on
acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or
difficulties in our relationships with our corporate
collaborators or contract manufacturers, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.

We may expand our own manufacturing capacity to support
commercial production of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or
API, for our product candidates. This will require substantial
additional funds, and we will need to hire and train significant
numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our
facility. Start-up costs can be large and scale-up entails
significant risks related to process development and
manufacturing yields. We may be unable to develop manufacturing
facilities that are sufficient to produce drug material for
clinical trials or commercial use. In addition, we may be unable
to secure adequate filling and finishing services to support our
products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations may be materially harmed.

We may be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for
the manufacture of our product candidates. In addition, we may
face difficulties in developing or acquiring production
technology and managerial personnel to manufacture sufficient
quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in
compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental
regulations and governmental permitting requirements.



If any of our clinical programs are discontinued, we may
    face costs related to the unused capacity at our manufacturing
    facilities.

We have large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New
York. Under a long-term manufacturing agreement with Merck,
which expires in October 2006 unless extended for one additional
year by Merck, we produce an intermediate for a Merck pediatric
vaccine at our facility in Rensselaer, New York. We also use our
facilities to produce API for our own clinical and preclinical
candidates. If we no longer use our facilities to manufacture
the Merck intermediate or clinical candidates are discontinued,
we would have to absorb overhead costs and inefficiencies.

Certain of our raw materials are single-sourced from third
    parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our
    ability to supply our products.

Certain raw materials necessary for manufacturing and
formulation of our product candidates are provided by
single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. We would be
unable to obtain these raw materials for an indeterminate period
of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to
cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these
materials or products to us for any reason, including due to
regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial
developments at or affecting the supplier or due to labor
shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and
adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product
candidates for use in clinical trials, which could materially
and adversely affect our business and future prospects.

Also, certain of the raw materials required in the manufacturing
and the formulation of our clinical candidates may be derived
from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine
serum, and human serum albumin. There are certain European
regulatory restrictions on using these biological source
materials. If we are required to substitute these sources to
comply with European regulatory requirements, our clinical
development activities may be delayed or interrupted.

Risks Related to Commercialization of Products

If we are unable to establish sales, marketing, and
    distribution capabilities, or enter into agreements with third
    parties to do so, we will be unable to successfully market and
    sell future products.

We have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities and
have only a small staff with marketing capabilities. If we are
unable to obtain those capabilities, either by developing our
own organizations or entering into agreements with service
providers, we will not be able to successfully sell any products
that we may obtain regulatory approval for and bring to market
in the future. In that event, we will not be able to generate
significant revenue, even if our product candidates are
approved. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the
qualified sales and marketing personnel we need or that we will
be able to enter into marketing or distribution agreements with
third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all. Under the
terms of our collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, we
currently rely on sanofi-aventis for sales, marketing, and
distribution of the VEGF Trap, should it be approved in the
future by regulatory authorities for marketing. We will have to
rely on a third party or devote significant resources to develop
our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our
other product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful in
developing our own sales, marketing, and distribution
organization.

We may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product
    candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial
    use.

Changes in product formulations and manufacturing processes may
be required as product candidates progress in clinical
development and are ultimately commercialized. If we are unable
to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing
processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product
candidates, including the VEGF Trap, IL-1 Trap, and IL-4/13
Trap, we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our
clinical trials, which would delay the development of our
product candidates. Similarly, if we are unable to supply
sufficient quantities of our product or develop product
formulations suitable for commercial use, we will not be able to
successfully commercialize our product candidates. For example,
we



are in the process of developing formulations that would allow
delivery of higher doses of the IL-1 Trap to test in clinical
trials. The dose levels that will be tested are substantially
higher than the dose levels of other biological therapeutics
currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Separate new formulations will be used for subcutaneous and
intravenous administration of the higher dose therapeutic. If we
are unable to develop or manufacture such a higher dose
formulation that can be produced in a cost-effective manner,
potential future IL-1 Trap sales and profitability may be
limited.

Even if our product candidates are ever approved, their
    commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors
    may get to the marketplace before we do with better or lower
    cost drugs or the market for our product candidates may be too
    small to support commercialization or sufficient
    profitability.

There is substantial competition in the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
and chemical companies. Many of our competitors have
substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical product
development and manufacturing capabilities, and financial,
marketing, and human resources than we do. Our smaller
competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they
acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative
arrangements or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even
if we achieve product commercialization, our competitors have
achieved, and may continue to achieve, product commercialization
before our products are approved for marketing and sale.

Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist on the market for
treating certain cancers and many different pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies are working to develop competing VEGF
antagonists, including Novartis, Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, and
Pfizer. Many of these molecules are further along in development
than the VEGF Trap and may offer competitive advantages over our
molecule. Novartis has an ongoing phase 3 clinical
development program evaluating an orally delivered VEGF tyrosine
kinase in different cancer settings. If this phase 3
product candidate is safer and more efficacious than
Genentech’s approved VEGF antibody in these cancer
settings, it will make it more difficult for us to successfully
develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap. The marketing approval
for Genentech’s VEGF antagonist,
Avastin

tm

,
may make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical
trials to support the VEGF Trap and to obtain regulatory
approval of the VEGF Trap in these cancer settings. This may
delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
commercialize the VEGF Trap. In addition, even if the VEGF Trap
is ever approved for sale for the treatment of certain cancers,
it will be difficult for our drug to compete against Avastin
and, if approved by the FDA, the Novartis phase 3 tyrosine
kinase, because doctors and patients will have significant
experience using these medicines.

The market for eye diseases is also very competitive. Eyetech
Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer are marketing an approved VEGF
inhibitor for age-related macular degeneration. Novartis and
Genentech are collaborating on another VEGF inhibitor for the
treatment of eye diseases that is in phase 3 development.
The marketing approval of the Eyetech/ Pfizer VEGF inhibitor and
the potential approval of the Novarits/ Genentech VEGF antibody
makes it more difficult for us to successfully develop the VEGF
Trap in eye diseases. In addition, even if the VEGF Trap is ever
approved for sale for the treatment of eye diseases, it will be
difficult for our drug to compete against the Eyetech/ Pfizer
drug and, if approved by the FDA, the Novartis/ Genentech
phase 3 VEGF antibody, because doctors and patients will
have significant experience using these medicines.

The markets for both rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are both
very competitive. Several highly successful medicines are
available for these diseases. Examples include the
TNF-antagonists Enbrel® (a registered trademark of Amgen),
Remicade® (a registered trademark of Centocor), and
Humira® (a registered trademark of Abbott Laboratories) for
rheumatoid arthritis, the IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret®
(a registered trademark of Amgen), and the leukotriene-modifier
Singulair® (a registered trademark of Merck), as well as
various inexpensive corticosteroid medicines for asthma. The
availability of highly effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists
and other marketed therapies makes it more difficult to
successfully develop the IL-1 Trap for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, since it will be difficult to enroll
patients with rheumatoid arthritis to participate in clinical
trials of the IL-1 Trap. This may delay or impair our ability to
successfully develop the drug candidate. In addition, even if
the IL-1 Trap is ever approved for sale, it will be difficult
for our drug to compete against these FDA approved
TNF-antagonists because doctors and patients will have
significant experience using these effective medicines.
Moreover, these approved therapeutics may



offer competitive advantages over the IL-1 Trap, such as
requiring fewer injections. In addition, there are both small
molecules and antibodies in development by third parties that
are designed to block the synthesis of interleukin-1 or inhibit
the signaling of interleukin-1. For example, Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is developing an oral cytokine
inhibitor of interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE). These
drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over the IL-1
Trap. The successful development of these competing molecules
could delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
commercialize the IL-1 Trap.

We are developing the IL-1 Trap for the treatment of a spectrum
of rare diseases associated with mutations in the

CIAS1

gene. These rare genetic disorders affect a small group of
people, estimated to be between several hundred and a few
thousand. There may be too few patients with these genetic
disorders to profitably commercialize the IL-1 Trap in this
indication.

The successful commercialization of our product candidates
    will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of
    these products from third-party payors.

Sales of biopharmaceutical products largely depend on the
reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government
health care programs and private health insurers. Without the
financial support of the governments or third-party payors, the
market for any biopharmaceutical product will be limited. These
third-party payors increasingly challenge the price and examine
the cost-effectiveness of products and services. Significant
uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of any new
therapeutic, particularly if there exist lower-cost standards of
care. Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our
products, which would harm our business.

Risk Related to Employees

We are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot
    recruit and retain leaders in our research, development,
    manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our business will
    be harmed.

We are highly dependent on our executive officers. If we are not
able to retain any of these persons or our Chairman, our
business may suffer. In particular, we depend on the services of
Roy Vagelos, M.D., the Chairman of our Board of Directors,
Leonard Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our President and
Chief Executive Officer, and George D.
Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice
President, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron
Research Laboratories. There is intense competition in the
biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial
personnel in the development, manufacture, and commercialization
of drugs. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain
the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

If we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade
    secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our
    proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will
    be harmed.

Our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology
and other information that we protect as trade secrets. We seek
to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through
confidentiality agreements. If our trade secrets are improperly
exposed, either by our own employees or our collaborators, it
would help our competitors and adversely affect our business. We
will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized
use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are
covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
maintained as trade secrets. The patent position of
biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual
questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted
with certainty. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented. Patent applications filed outside the United
States may be challenged by third parties who file an
opposition. Such opposition proceedings are increasingly common
in the European Union and are costly to defend. We have patent
applications that are being opposed and it is likely that we
will need to defend additional patent applications in the
future. Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary
position or competitive advantages against competitors.
Furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to us, the
enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive
and time consuming.



We may be restricted in our development and/or
    commercialization activities by third party patents.

Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to
operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary
rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that they have
blocking patents to our Trap products in clinical development,
either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to fusion
proteins or proprietary rights to components of the Trap or the
way it is manufactured. We are aware of certain United States
and foreign patents relating to particular IL-4 and IL-13
receptors. Our IL-4/13 Trap includes portions of the IL-4 and
IL-13 receptors. In addition, we are aware of a broad patent
held by Genentech relating to proteins fused to certain
immunoglobulin domains. Our Trap product candidates include
proteins fused to immunoglobulin domains. Although we do not
believe that we are infringing valid and enforceable third party
patents, the holders of these patents may sue us for
infringement and a court may find that we are infringing one or
more validly issued patents, which may materially harm our
business.

Any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent
us from manufacturing, selling or developing our drug
candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly
issued patents of third parties. In the event that the
manufacture, use or sale of any of our clinical candidates
infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of
third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product
development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our drugs
and may be required to pay costly damages. Such a result may
materially harm our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. Legal disputes are likely to be costly and time
consuming to defend.

We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment,
such licenses are needed. If any licenses are required, we may
not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all. The failure to obtain any such license could
prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of
our product candidates, which could severely harm our business.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

Our stock price is extremely volatile.

There has been significant volatility in our stock price and
generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies’
securities. Various factors and events may have a significant
impact on the market price of our common stock. These factors
include, by way of example:

The trading price of our common stock has been, and could
continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to
these and other factors, including the sale or attempted sale of
a large amount of our common stock in the market. Broad market
fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our
common stock.



Future sales of our common stock by our significant
    shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our
    ability to raise funds in new share offerings.

A small number of our shareholders beneficially own a
substantial amount of our common stock. As of February 22,
2005, our seven largest shareholders, which include
sanofi-aventis and Novartis, beneficially owned 54.5% of our
outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A stock, assuming,
in the case of Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D, our chief
executive officer, the exercise of all options held by him which
are exercisable within 60 days of February 22, 2005.
As of that date, Novartis owned 7,527,050 shares of Common
Stock, representing approximately 13.4% of the shares of Common
Stock and Class A stock then outstanding. Under our registration
rights agreement with Novartis, these shares of Common Stock may
generally not be sold or otherwise transferred by Novartis until
after March 28, 2005. Commencing after March 28, 2005,
Novartis has certain registration rights with respect to these
shares. As of February 22, 2005, sanofi-aventis owned
2,799,552 shares of Common Stock, representing
approximately 5.0% of the shares of Common Stock and Class A
stock then outstanding. Under our stock purchase agreement with
sanofi-aventis, these shares may generally not be sold or
otherwise transferred until after September  5, 2005,
and for one year after that date, sanofi-aventis may sell no
more than 250,000 shares in any calendar quarter. After
September 5, 2006, sanofi-aventis may sell no more than
500,000 shares in any calendar quarter. Accordingly, in
2005 and thereafter, as the restrictions on transfer applicable
to the shares of Common Stock owned by Novartis and
sanofi-aventis expire, these shares will be freely tradeable in
the public market, subject, in the case of sanofi-aventis, to
the foregoing continuing contractual sales volume restrictions.
If Novartis or sanofi-aventis, or our other significant
shareholders or we, sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock
in the public market, or the perception that such sales may
occur exists, the market price of our Common Stock could fall.
Sales of Common Stock by our significant shareholders, including
sanofi-aventis and Novartis, also might make it more difficult
for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity-related
securities in the future at a time and price that we deem
appropriate.

Our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant
    influence over matters requiring shareholder approval.

Holders of Class A stock, who are the shareholders who
purchased their stock from us before our initial public
offering, are entitled to ten votes per share, while holders of
Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. As of
February 22, 2005, holders of Class A stock held 4.2%
of all shares of Common Stock and Class A stock then
outstanding, and had 30.5% of the combined voting power of all
shares of Common Stock and Class A stock. These shareholders, if
acting together, would be in a position to significantly
influence the election of our directors and to effect or prevent
certain corporate transactions that require majority or
supermajority approval of the combined classes, including
mergers and other business combinations. This may result in our
company taking corporate actions that you may not consider to be
in your best interest and may affect the price of our common
stock. As of February 22, 2005:

•

our current officers and directors beneficially owned 13.3% of
    our outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A stock and
    33.4% of the combined voting power of our shares of Common Stock
    and Class A stock, assuming the exercise of all options
    held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days
    of February 22, 2005; and

•

our seven largest shareholders beneficially owned 54.5% of our
    outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A stock and 60.1%
    of the combined voting power of our shares of Common Stock and
    Class A stock, assuming, in the case of Leonard S.
    Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D, our chief executive officer,
    the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable
    within 60 days of February 22, 2005.

The
anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws and
our rights agreement, and of New York corporate law, could
deter, delay or prevent an acquisition or other “change in
control” of us and could adversely affect the price of our
common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our
by-laws, our rights agreement and the New York Business
Corporation Law contain various provisions that could have the
effect of delaying or preventing



a change in control of our company or our management that
shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. Some of these
provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more
difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and
take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit
the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future
for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:

We have a shareholder rights plan which could make it more
difficult for a third party to acquire us without the support of
our board of directors and principal shareholders. In addition,
many of our stock options issued under our 2000 Long-Term
Incentive Plan may become fully vested in connection with a
“change in control” of the Company, as defined in the
plan.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market
    Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to
changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of
available cash balances in investment grade corporate and
U.S. government securities. We do not believe we are
materially exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our
current policies we do not use interest rate derivative
instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We
estimated that a one percent change in interest rates would
result in an approximately $1.4 million change in the fair
market value of our investment portfolio at both
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of
the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Based on this



evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer each concluded that, as of the end of such period, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis,
and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
management, including the Company’s chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
using the framework in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2004. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a
report on management’s assessment and the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, which report is included herein at page
F-2.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
December 31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of Regeneron
Pharmaceutical Inc.’s 2004 financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Financial statements

In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the

F-2


company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

1.     Organization and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or
“Regeneron”) was incorporated in January 1988 in the
State of New York. The Company is engaged in research and
development programs to discover and commercialize therapeutics
to treat human disorders and conditions. The Company’s
facilities are located in New York. The Company’s business
is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to,
uncertainties relating to conducting pharmaceutical research,
obtaining regulatory approvals, commercializing products, and
obtaining and enforcing patents.

2.     Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets
are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are
removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is
recognized in operations. The estimated useful lives of
property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Costs of construction of certain long-lived assets include
capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated
useful life of the related asset. The Company capitalized
interest costs of $0.3 million and $0.2 million in
2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company did not capitalize any
interest costs in 2004.

The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of property
and equipment and evaluates such assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is
determined to exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows
are less than the carrying amount in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. As of
December 31, 2004, there were no impairments of long-lived
assets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and the balance
sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported in the balance
sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined based on standards that approximate the first-in,
first-out method. Inventories are shown net of applicable
reserves.

Revenue Recognition and Change in Accounting
    Principle

a.

Contract Research and Development and Research Progress
    Payments

The Company recognizes revenue from contract research and
development and research progress payments in accordance with
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB 104”) and

F-9


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

FASB Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No. 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”). SAB 104
superseded Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statement

(“SAB 101”), in December 2003. During the
third quarter of 2003, the Company elected to change the method
it uses to recognize revenue under SAB 101 related to
non-refundable collaborator payments, including up-front
licensing payments, payments for development activities, and
research progress (milestone) payments, to the Substantive
Milestone Method, adopted retroactively to January 1, 2003.
There was no cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle on prior periods. Under this method, the Company
recognizes revenue from non-refundable up-front license
payments, not tied to achieving a specific performance
milestone, ratably over the period over which the Company
expects to perform services. Payments for development activities
are recognized as revenue as earned, ratably over the period of
effort. Substantive at-risk milestone payments, which are based
on achieving a specific performance milestone, are recognized as
revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment
is due, provided there is no future service obligation
associated with that milestone. The change in accounting method
was made because the Company believes that it better reflects
the substance of the Company’s collaborative agreements and
is more consistent with current practices in the biotechnology
industry.

Previously, the Company had recognized revenue from
non-refundable collaborator payments based on the percentage of
costs incurred to date, estimated costs to complete, and total
expected contract revenue. However, the revenue recognized was
limited to the amount of non-refundable payments received. This
accounting method was adopted on January 1, 2000 upon the
release of SAB 101. The cumulative effect of adopting
SAB 101 at January 1, 2000 amounted to
$1.6 million of additional loss, with a corresponding
increase to deferred revenue that has been recognized in
subsequent periods, of which $0.1 million,
$0.4 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, was
included in contract research and development revenue in 2004,
2003, and 2002. The $1.6 million represented a portion of a
1989 payment received from Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. in
consideration for a fifteen year limited right of first
negotiation to license up to three of the Company’s product
candidates in Japan (see Note 11d). The effect of income
taxes on the cumulative effect adjustment was immaterial.

b.

Contract Manufacturing

The Company has entered into a contract manufacturing agreement
under which it manufactures product and performs services for a
third party. Contract manufacturing revenue is recognized as
product is shipped and as services are performed (see
Note 12).

Investment Income

Interest income, which is included in investment income, is
recognized as earned.

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, are reviewed for
impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying value may not be recoverable. Estimated undiscounted
expected future cash flows are used to determine if an asset is
impaired in which case the asset’s carrying value would be
reduced to fair value. For all periods presented, no impairment
losses were recorded.

Patents

As a result of the Company’s research and development
efforts, it has obtained, applied for, or is applying for a
number of patents to protect proprietary technology and
inventions. All costs associated with patents are expensed as
incurred.

F-10


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs directly
attributable to the conduct of research and development
programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
collaboration and licensing agreements (see Note 10e), the
cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
services related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical
trial expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, expenses
related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to
commencing commercial production of a product under contract
manufacturing arrangements, and the allocable portions of
facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and
maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All
costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.

For each clinical trial that the Company conducts, certain
clinical trial costs, which are included in research and
development expenses, are expensed based on the expected total
number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients
enter the trial, and the period over which clinical
investigators or contract research organizations are expected to
provide services. During the course of a clinical trial, the
Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense recognition if
actual results differ from the Company’s estimates.

Per Share Data

Net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is computed on
the basis of the net income (loss) for the period divided by the
weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
Class A Stock outstanding during the period. The basic net
income (loss) per share excludes restricted stock awards until
vested. The diluted net income per share for the year ended
December 31, 2004 is based upon the weighted average number
of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock and the common
stock equivalents outstanding when dilutive. Common stock
equivalents include: (i) outstanding stock options and
restricted stock awards under the Company’s Long-Term
Incentive Plans, which are included under the treasury stock
method when dilutive, and (ii) Common Stock to be issued
under the assumed conversion of the Company’s outstanding
convertible senior subordinated notes, which are included under
the if-converted method when dilutive. The computation of
diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 does not include common stock equivalents, since
such inclusion would be antidilutive. Disclosures required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share,

have been included in Note 17.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined on
the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts
(“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax
assets for which realization is uncertain. See Note 15.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) represents the change in net assets
of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
Comprehensive income (loss) of the Company includes net income
(loss) adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or loss on
marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
comprehensive income (loss) is immaterial. Comprehensive income
for the year ended December 31, 2004 and comprehensive
losses for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 have
been included in the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities, restricted marketable securities, and
receivables from the sanofi-aventis Group, The
Procter & Gamble Company, and Merck & Co.,
Inc. The Company generally invests its excess cash in
obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, bank
deposits, investment grade debt securities issued by
corporations, governments, and financial institutions, and money
market funds that invest in these instruments. The Company has
established guidelines that relate to credit quality,
diversification, and maturity, and that limit exposure to any
one issue of securities.

Risks and Uncertainties

Regeneron has had no sales of its products and there is no
assurance that the Company’s research and development
efforts will be successful, that the Company will ever have
commercially approved products, or that the Company will achieve
significant sales of any such products. The Company has
generally incurred net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since its inception, and revenues to date have
principally been limited to payments for research from our
collaborators and for contract manufacturing from two
pharmaceutical companies and investment income. The Company
operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and is
dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants,
collaborators, and certain third-party suppliers, including
single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers of certain raw
materials and equipment. Regeneron, as licensee, licenses
certain technologies that are important to the Company’s
business which impose various obligations on the Company. If
Regeneron fails to comply with these requirements, licensors may
have the right to terminate the Company’s licenses.

Contract research and development revenue in 2004 was primarily
earned from the sanofi-aventis Group, Novartis Pharma AG, and
The Procter & Gamble Company under collaboration
agreements (see Notes 11a, 11b and 11e). Under the
collaboration agreement with sanofi-aventis, agreed upon VEGF
Trap development expenses incurred by Regeneron during the term
of the agreement will be funded by sanofi-aventis. In addition,
the Company earned a $25.0 million payment in 2004 upon
achievement of an early-stage clinical milestone and may receive
up to $360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified VEGF Trap marketing approvals.
Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Under the
collaboration agreement with Novartis, agreed upon IL-1 Trap
development expenses were shared equally by the Company and
Novartis in 2003. In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of
its intention not to proceed with the joint development of the
IL-1 Trap and the Company subsequently recognized contract
research and development revenue equal to the remaining balance
of a 2003 up-front payment from Novartis that had been deferred.
Under the long-term collaboration with Procter &
Gamble, Procter & Gamble is obligated to provide
payments to fund Regeneron research of $2.5 million per
quarter, before adjustments for inflation, through December
2005, with no further research obligations by either party
thereafter. Contract manufacturing revenue in 2004 was earned
from Merck & Co., Inc. under a long-term manufacturing
agreement that extends, as amended, through October 2006 (see
Note 12), but may be terminated at any time by Merck upon
Merck’s payment of a termination fee and may be extended by
Merck, upon twelve-months’ prior notice, for an additional
year through October 2007.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
include useful lives of property, plant, and equipment, the
periods over which certain revenues and expenses will be
recognized including contract research and development revenue
recognized from non-refundable up-front licensing payments,
contract manufacturing revenue recognized from reimbursed,
deferred capital costs,

F-12


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

and expense recognition of certain clinical trial costs which
are included in research and development expenses, and the
extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset
by a valuation allowance.

Stock-based Employee Compensation

The accompanying financial position and results of operations of
the Company have been prepared in accordance with APB Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”). Under APB No. 25,
generally, no compensation expense is recognized in the
accompanying financial statements in connection with the
awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as
of the grant date, all terms associated with the award are fixed
and the quoted market price of the Company’s stock, as of
the grant date, is equal to or less than the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock as defined.

The Company has stock-based incentive plans, which are more
fully described in Note 13a. The following table
illustrates the effect on the Company’s net income (loss)
and net income (loss) per share had compensation costs for the
incentive plans been determined in accordance with the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation as
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”). Since option grants
awarded during 2004, 2003, and 2002 vest over several years and
additional awards are expected to be issued in the future, the
pro forma results shown below are not likely to be
representative of the effects on future years of the application
of the fair value based method.

In 2003, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer was granted
permission by the Board of Directors to initiate a one-time net
cashless exercise of stock options. Upon completion of the net
cashless exercise, the Company recognized $0.3 million of
compensation expense, which equaled the excess of the fair
market value of the shares over the option exercise price on the
date that the Board of Directors granted its consent for the
transaction.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Company intends to adopt the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as
modified by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148,

Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

(“SFAS No. 148”), using the modified
prospective method. SFAS Nos. 123/148 require that
compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair market value
of the share-based payment (including stock option awards) be
recognized over the vesting period of the awards. Under the
modified prospective method, compensation cost will be
recognized beginning January 1, 2005 for (a) all share
based payments

granted on or after January 1, 2005, including replacement
options granted under the Company’s stock option exchange
program (see Note 13a) and (b) all awards granted to
employees prior to January 1, 2005 that remain unvested on
that date. The Company will recognize this compensation cost in
each of the categories of expense in the Company’s
Statement of Operations.

Other disclosures required by SFAS No. 123 have been
included in Note 13a.

Statement of Cash Flows

Supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing
activities:

In 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company awarded 105,052, 219,367,
and 139,611 shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock under
the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan
(see Note 13a). The Company records unearned compensation
in Stockholders’ Equity related to these awards based on
the fair market value of shares of the Company’s Common
Stock on the grant date of the Restricted Stock award, which is
expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the period that the
restrictions on these shares lapse. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, the
Company recognized $2.5 million, $2.3 million, and
$1.8 million, respectively, of compensation expense related
to Restricted Stock awards.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $0.6 million,
$0.8 million, and $13.5 million of capital
expenditures, respectively.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 were $0.9 million,
$0.7 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, of
accrued 401(k) Savings Plan contribution expense. During the
first quarter of 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company contributed
64,333, 42,543, and 21,953 shares, respectively, of Common
Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in satisfaction of these
obligations.

Included in marketable securities at December 31, 2004,
2003, and 2002 were $2.6 million, $0.9 million, and
$2.0 million of accrued interest income, respectively.

Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
    Standards

In April 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Statement
No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the
Two — Class Method under FASB Statement
No. 128, Earnings per Share

(“EITF 03-6”). EITF 03-6 addresses a
number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per
share (“EPS”) by companies that have issued securities
other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to
participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and
if, it declares dividends on its common stock. EITF 03-6
defines participation rights based solely on whether the holder
would be entitled to receive any dividends if the entity
declared them during the period and requires the use of the
two-class method for computing basic EPS when participating
convertible securities exist. In addition, EITF 03-6
expands the use of the two-class method to encompass other forms
of participating securities and is effective for fiscal periods
beginning after March 31, 2004. Since the Company has no
participating securities, the Company’s adoption of
EITF 03-6 did not have an impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB
43, Chapter 4

(“SFAS No. 151”).
SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and
wasted material by requiring that those items be recognized as
current-period charges in all circumstances.
SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. Management believes that the future
adoption of SFAS No. 151 will not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”). SFAS No. 123R
is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for

F-14


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

Stock-Based Compensation

, and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and its related implementation guidance.
SFAS No. 123R establishes standards for the accounting
for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. SFAS No. 123R
focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an
entity obtains employee services in share-based payment
transactions, and requires the recognition of compensation
expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based
payment (including stock options and restricted stock) issued to
employees. SFAS No. 123R is effective for fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company
currently intends to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective
July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. Under
the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized
beginning with the effective date based on (a) the requirements
of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after
the effective date and (b) the requirements of SFAS No. 123
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date
of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective
date. Although the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R
has not yet been quantified, management believes that the future
adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29
(“SFAS No. 153”)

. SFAS No. 153
eliminates an exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets under APB Opinion No. 29, and replaces it
with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets
that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is
to be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary
asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. Management believes that the future adoption
of SFAS No. 153 will not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

3.

Marketable Securities

The Company considers its unrestricted marketable securities to
be “available-for-sale,” as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. Gross
unrealized holding gains and losses are reported as a net amount
in a separate component of stockholders’ equity entitled
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). The net change in
unrealized holding gains and losses is excluded from operations
and included in stockholders’ equity as a separate
component of comprehensive loss.

The following tables summarize the amortized cost basis of
marketable securities, the aggregate fair value of marketable
securities, and gross unrealized holding gains and losses at
December 31, 2004 and 2003:

Realized gains and losses are included as a component of
investment income. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003, and 2002, gross realized gains and losses were not
significant. In computing realized gains and losses, the Company
computes the cost of its investments on a specific
identification basis. Such cost includes the direct costs to
acquire the securities, adjusted for the amortization of any
discount or premium. The fair value of marketable securities has
been estimated based on quoted market prices.

The following table shows the unrealized losses and fair value
of the Company’s marketable securities with unrealized
losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily
impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time
that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized
loss position, at December 31, 2004. These securities
mature at various dates through May 2006.

market value of the Company’s portfolio. Based upon the
Company’s currently projected sources and uses of cash, the
Company intends to hold these securities until a recovery of
fair value, which may be maturity. Therefore, the Company does
not consider these marketable securities to be
other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2004.
Unrealized holding losses on marketable securities at
December 31, 2003 were losses for less than twelve months.

Stockholders’ Equity

The Company’s Amended Certificate of Incorporation provides
for the issuance of up to 40 million shares of Class A
Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 160 million
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share. Shares
of Class A Stock are convertible, at any time, at the
option of the holder into shares of Common Stock on a
share-for-share basis. Holders of Class A Stock have rights
and privileges identical to Common Stockholders except that
Class A Stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share,
while Common Stockholders are entitled to one vote per share.
Class A Stock may only be transferred to specified
Permitted Transferees, as defined. The Company’s Board of
Directors (the “Board”) is authorized to issue up to
30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined
by the Board.

During 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan in
which Rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one
Right for each share of Common Stock and Class A Stock
(collectively, “Stock”) held by shareholders of record
as of the close of business on October 18, 1996. Each Right
initially entitles the registered holder to buy a unit
(“Unit”) consisting of one-one thousandth of a share
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (“A
Preferred Stock”) at a purchase price of $120 per Unit
(the “Purchase Price”). Initially the Rights were
attached to all Stock certificates representing shares then
outstanding, and no separate Rights certificates were
distributed. The Rights will separate from the Stock and a
“distribution date” will occur upon the earlier of
(i) ten days after a public announcement that a person or
group of affiliated or associated persons, excluding certain
defined persons, (an “Acquiring Person”) has acquired,
or has obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of
20% or more of the outstanding shares of Stock or (ii) ten
business days following the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer that would result in a person or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of such outstanding shares of
Stock. The Rights are not exercisable unless a distribution date
occurs and will expire at the close of business on
October  18, 2006 unless earlier redeemed by the
Company, subject to certain defined restrictions, for
$.01 per Right. In the event that an Acquiring Person
becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then
outstanding shares of Stock (unless such acquisition is made
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for all outstanding
shares of the Company, at a price determined by a majority of
the independent directors of the Company who are not
representatives, nominees, affiliates, or associates of an
Acquiring Person to be fair and otherwise in the best interest
of the Company and its shareholders after receiving advice from
one or more investment banking firms), each Right (other than
Rights held by the Acquiring Person which shall be voided) will
entitle the

F-19

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

holder to purchase, at the Right’s then current exercise
price, common shares (or, in certain circumstances, cash,
property or other securities of the Company) having a value
twice the Right’s Exercise Price. The Right’s Exercise
Price is the Purchase Price times the number of shares of Common
Stock associated with each Right (initially, one). Upon the
occurrence of any such events, the Rights held by an Acquiring
Person become null and void. In certain circumstances, a Right
entitles the holder to receive, upon exercise, shares of common
stock of an acquiring company having a value equal to two times
the Right’s Exercise Price.

As a result of the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Company’s
Board designated 100,000 shares of preferred stock as A
Preferred Stock. The A Preferred Stock has certain preferences,
as defined.

In October 2001, the Company completed a private placement of
$200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior
subordinated notes, which are convertible into shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. See Note 10d.

In March 2003, Novartis Pharma AG purchased $48.0 million
of newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s Common
Stock. Regeneron issued 2,400,000 shares of Common Stock to
Novartis in March 2003 and an additional 5,127,050 shares
in May 2003 for a total of 7,527,050 shares based upon the
average closing price of the Common Stock for the 20 consecutive
trading days ending May 12, 2003. See Note 11b.

In August 2003, Regeneron issued to Merck & Co., Inc.,
109,450 newly issued unregistered shares of the Company’s
Common Stock as consideration for a non-exclusive license
agreement granted by Merck to the Company. In August 2004, the
Company repurchased these shares from Merck for a purchase price
of $0.9 million based on the fair market value of the
shares on August 19, 2004. The shares were subsequently
retired. See Note 10e.

In September 2003, Aventis purchased 2,799,552 newly issued
unregistered shares of the Company’s Common Stock for
$45.0 million, based upon the average closing price of the
Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days ending
September 4, 2003. See Note 11a

$6.0 million, and $3.6 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004 2003, and 2002, respectively.

b.     Capital Leases

In 2003 and prior years, the Company had leased equipment under
noncancelable capital leases. Lease terms were generally four
years after which, for certain leases, the Company purchased the
equipment at amounts defined by the agreements. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company had no remaining capital
leases outstanding.

c.     Loan Payable

In March 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
agreement with Novartis Pharma AG. In accordance with that
agreement, Regeneron funded its share of 2003 collaboration
development expenses through a loan from Novartis, which bore
interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus 2.5%,
compounded quarterly. In March 2004, Novartis forgave its
outstanding loan to Regeneron totaling $17.8 million,
including accrued interest, based on Regeneron’s achieving
a pre-defined development milestone. See Note 11b.

d.     Convertible Debt

In October 2001, the Company issued $200.0 million
aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated
notes (“Notes”) in a private placement for proceeds to
the Company of $192.7 million, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discount and out-of-pocket expenses
(collectively, “Deferred Financing Costs”). The Notes
bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and
mature on October 17, 2008. Deferred Financing Costs, which
are included in other assets, are amortized as interest expense
over the period from the Notes’ issuance to stated
maturity. The Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder
at any time, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a
conversion price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances. Regeneron may also
redeem some or all of the Notes at any time if the closing price
of the Company’s Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the
conversion price then in effect for a

F-21


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per

specified period of time. The fair market value of the Notes
fluctuates over time. The estimated fair value of the Notes at
December 31, 2004 was approximately $190.0 million.

With respect to the Notes, the Company pledged as collateral
$31.6 million of U.S. government securities
(“Restricted Marketable Securities”) which matured at
various dates through October 2004. At December 31, 2003,
the balance of the Restricted Marketable Securities had an
amortized cost basis of $10.9 million, due to scheduled
interest payments made on the Notes in 2002 and 2003. Upon
maturity, the proceeds of the remaining Restricted Marketable
Securities paid the scheduled 2004 interest payments on the
Notes when due. The Company considered its Restricted Marketable
Securities to be “held-to-maturity,” as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

. These securities were reported at their
amortized cost, which included the direct costs to acquire the
securities, plus the amortization of any discount or premium,
and accrued interest earned on the securities. The fair value of
the Restricted Marketable Securities at December 31, 2003,
which was estimated based on quoted market prices, was
$11.0 million and the gross unrealized holding gain was
$0.1 million. At December 31, 2004 there were no
remaining Restricted Marketable Securities.

e.     Research Collaboration and
    Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company’s research and development efforts,
the Company enters into research collaboration and licensing
agreements with related and unrelated companies, scientific
collaborators, universities, and consultants. The Company also
has a license and supply agreement with Nektar Therapeutics for
a reagent used to formulate one of the Company’s product
candidates. These agreements contain varying terms and
provisions which include fees and milestones to be paid by the
Company, services to be provided, and ownership rights to
certain proprietary technology developed under the agreements.
Some of the agreements contain provisions which require the
Company to pay royalties, as defined, at rates that range from
0.25% to 10%, in the event the Company sells or licenses any
proprietary products developed under the respective agreements.

Certain agreements under which the Company is required to pay
fees permit the Company, upon 30 to 90-day written notice, to
terminate such agreements. With respect to payments associated
with these agreements, the Company incurred expenses of
$1.4 million, $2.7 million, and $1.7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

In August 2003, Merck & Co., Inc. granted the Company a
non-exclusive license agreement to certain patents and patent
applications which may be used in the development and
commercialization of AXOKINE®. As consideration, the
Company issued to Merck 109,450 newly issued unregistered shares
of its Common Stock (the “Merck Shares”), valued at
$1.5 million based on the fair market value of shares of
the Company’s Common Stock on the agreement’s
effective date. In August 2004, the Company repurchased from
Merck and subsequently retired the Merck Shares for
$0.9 million based on the fair market value of the shares
on August 19, 2004. The Company also made a cash payment of
$0.6 million to Merck as required under the license
agreement. The agreement also requires the Company to make an
additional payment to Merck upon receipt of marketing approval
for a product covered by the licensed patents. In addition, the
Company would be required to pay royalties, at staggered rates
in the mid-single digits, based on the net sales of products
covered by the licensed patents.

Research and Development Agreements

The Company has entered into various agreements related to its
activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and
utilize its technology platforms. Amounts earned by the Company
in connection with these agreements, which were recognized as
contract research and development revenue, research progress
payments, or other contract income, as applicable, totaled
$198.7 million, $47.4 million, and $10.9 million
in

F-22


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Total Company incurred
expenses associated with these agreements, which include
reimbursable, as applicable, and non-reimbursable amounts and an
allocable portion of general and administrative costs, were
$75.3 million, $56.0 million and $11.9 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Significant agreements are
described below.

a.     The sanofi-aventis
    Group

In September 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
agreement (the “s-a Agreement”) with the
sanofi-aventis Group, to jointly develop and commercialize the
Company’s Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
(“VEGF”) Trap throughout the world with the exception
of Japan, where product rights remain with Regeneron. In
connection with this agreement, sanofi-aventis made a
non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and
purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of the
Company’s Common Stock for $45.0 million, based upon
the average closing price of the Common Stock for the five
consecutive trading days ending September 4, 2003.

In January 2005, the Company and sanofi-aventis amended the s-a
Agreement to exclude local administration of the VEGF Trap to
the eye (the “Excluded Field”) from joint development
under the agreement, and product rights to the VEGF Trap in the
Excluded Field reverted to Regeneron. In connection with this
amendment, sanofi-aventis made a $25.0 million
non-refundable payment to Regeneron (the “Excluded Field
Termination Payment”) in January 2005.

Under the s-a Agreement, as amended, Regeneron and
sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap, except for sales in the
Excluded Field. In December 2004, Regeneron earned a
$25.0 million payment from sanofi-aventis, which was
received in January 2005, upon achievement of an early-stage
clinical milestone. The Company may also receive up to
$360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF
Trap indications in Europe or the United States.

Under the s-a Agreement, agreed upon development expenses
incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will
be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes
profitable, Regeneron will reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of
these development expenses, or half of $86.5 million as of
December 31, 2004, in accordance with a formula based on
the amount of development expenses and Regeneron’s share of
the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at
Regeneron’s option. Regeneron has the option to conduct
additional pre-Phase III studies at its own expense. In
connection with the January 2005 amendment to the s-a Agreement,
the Excluded Field Termination Payment of $25.0 million
will be considered a VEGF Trap development expense and will be
subject to 50% reimbursement by Regeneron to sanofi-aventis, as
described above, if the collaboration becomes profitable. In
addition, if the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product in
the Excluded Field (“First Excluded Sale”) predates
the first commercial sale of a VEGF Trap product under the
collaboration (“First Collaboration Sale”), Regeneron
will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to
$7.5 million of VEGF Trap development expenses, commencing
two years after the First Excluded Sale in accordance with a
defined formula, until the First Collaboration Sale occurs.

Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without
cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
termination of the agreement for any reason, Regeneron’s
obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis, for 50% of VEGF Trap
development expenses will terminate, and the Company will retain
all rights to the VEGF Trap.

Revenue related to payments from sanofi-aventis is being
recognized under the Substantive Milestone Method (see
Note 2) in accordance with SAB 104. The up-front
payment of $80.0 million and reimbursement of
Regeneron-incurred development expenses are being recognized as
contract research and development revenue over the development
period. Milestone payments are recognized as research progress
payments. In addition to the $25.0 million research
progress payment earned in 2004, the Company

F-23

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

recognized $78.3 million and $14.3 million of contract
research and development revenue in 2004 and 2003, respectively,
in connection with the s-a Agreement. At December 31, 2004
and 2003, amounts receivable from sanofi-aventis totaled
$39.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively, and
deferred revenue was $65.8 million and $76.4 million,
respectively.

b.     Novartis Pharma AG

In March 2003, the Company entered into a collaboration
agreement (the “Novartis Agreement”) with Novartis
Pharma AG to jointly develop and commercialize the
Company’s Interleukin-1 Cytokine Trap
(“IL-1 Trap”). In connection with this agreement,
Novartis made a non-refundable up-front payment of
$27.0 million and purchased $48.0 million of newly
issued unregistered shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
Regeneron issued 2,400,000 shares of Common Stock to
Novartis in March 2003 and an additional 5,127,050 shares
in May 2003 for a total of 7,527,050 shares based upon the
average closing price of the Common Stock for the 20 consecutive
trading days ending May 12, 2003.

Development expenses incurred during 2003 were shared equally by
the Company and Novartis. Regeneron funded its share of 2003
development expenses through a loan (the “2003 Loan”)
from Novartis, which bore interest at a rate per annum equal to
the LIBOR rate plus 2.5%, compounded quarterly. As of
December 31, 2003, the 2003 Loan balance due Novartis,
including accrued interest, totaled $13.8 million. In March
2004, Novartis forgave the 2003 Loan and accrued interest
thereon, totaling $17.8 million, based on Regeneron’s
achieving a pre-defined development milestone.

In February 2004, Novartis provided notice of its intention not
to proceed with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap. In
March 2004, Novartis agreed to pay the Company
$42.75 million to satisfy its obligation to fund
development costs for the IL-1 Trap for the nine month
period following its notification and for the two months prior
to that notice. The Company recorded the $42.75 million as
other contract income in 2004. Regeneron and Novartis each
retain rights under the collaboration agreement to elect to
collaborate in the future on the development and
commercialization of certain other IL-1 antagonists.

Revenue related to payments from Novartis was recognized under
the Substantive Milestone Method (see Note 2) in accordance
with SAB 104. The up-front payment of $27.0 million
and reimbursement of Novartis’ share of Regeneron-incurred
development expenses were recognized as contract research and
development revenue. Forgiveness of the 2003 Loan and accrued
interest in 2004 was recognized as a research progress payment.
In 2003 the Company recognized $21.4 million of contract
research and development revenue in connection with the Novartis
Agreement. At December 31, 2003, amounts receivable from
Novartis totaled $3.2 million and deferred revenue was
$22.1 million. In 2004, the Company recognized contract
research and development revenue of $22.1 million, which
represented the remaining amount of the $27.0 million
up-front payment from Novartis that had previously been
deferred. At December 31, 2004 there were no amounts
receivable from Novartis and no deferred revenue.

c.     Amgen Inc.

In August 1990, the Company entered into a collaboration
agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with Amgen Inc. to
develop and attempt to commercialize two proprietary products
(the “Products”). The Amgen Agreement, among other
things, provided for Amgen and the Company to form a partnership
(“Amgen-Regeneron Partners” or the
“Partnership”) to complete the development and to
commercialize the Products. Amgen and the Company hold equal
ownership interests (subject to adjustment for any future
inequities in capital contributions, as defined) in the
Partnership. The Company accounts for its investment in the
Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting.
In 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company recognized its share of the
Partnership net income (loss) in the amounts of $134 thousand,
($63 thousand), and ($27 thousand), respectively,
which represents 50% of the total Partnership net income (loss).
In September 2002, the Company and Amgen each made capital
withdrawals of $0.5 million from the

F-24


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

Partnership. At December 31, 2004, the Company continues to
be an equal partner in Amgen-Regeneron Partners. Selected
financial data of the Partnership as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 are not significant. The
Partnership has no ongoing development activities at this time.

In October 2000, Amgen and Regeneron entered into an agreement
whereby Regeneron acquired Amgen’s patents and patent
applications relating to ciliary neurotrophic factor
(“CNTF”) and related molecules for $1.0 million.
As part of this agreement, Regeneron granted back to Amgen
exclusive, royalty free rights under these patents and patent
applications solely for human ophthalmic uses. In addition,
Regeneron entered into a covenant not to sue Amgen under
Regeneron’s patents and patent applications relating to
CNTF and related molecules solely for human ophthalmic uses.

In July 2002, Amgen and Immunex Corporation (now part of Amgen)
granted the Company a non-exclusive license to certain patents
and patent applications which may be used in the development and
commercialization of the IL-1 Trap. The license followed
two other licensing arrangements under which Regeneron obtained
a non-exclusive license to patents owned by ZymoGenetics, Inc.
and Tularik Inc. for use in connection with the IL-1 Trap
program. These license agreements would require the Company to
pay royalties based on the net sales of the IL-1 Trap if
and when it is approved for sale. In total, the royalty rate
under these three agreements would be in the mid-single digits.

d.     Sumitomo Chemical Company,
    Ltd.

During 1989, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. entered into a
Technology Development Agreement (“TDA”) with
Regeneron and paid the Company $5.6 million. In
consideration for this payment, Sumitomo Chemical received a
fifteen year limited right of first negotiation to license up to
three of the Company’s product candidates in Japan. In
connection with the Company’s implementation of
SAB 101 (see Note 2), the Company recognized this
payment as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the
TDA. The TDA expired in March 2004.

e.     The Procter &
    Gamble Company

In May 1997, the Company entered into a long-term collaboration
agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company to
discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products
(the “P&G Agreement”) and Procter &
Gamble agreed to provide funding for Regeneron’s research
efforts related to the collaboration. In connection with the
collaboration, in June 1997 and August 2000, Procter &
Gamble purchased 4.35 million and 573,630 shares of
the Company’s Common Stock at $9.87 and $29.75 per
share for a total of $42.9 million and $17.1 million,
respectively. In June 1997, Procter & Gamble also
received five year warrants to purchase an additional
1.45 million shares of the Company’s stock at
$9.87 per share, which were exercised in August 2000. As
consideration for the exercise price, Procter & Gamble
tendered 511,125 shares of the Company’s Common Stock
which had an aggregate value at the time of exercise, based upon
the average market price of the Company’s Common Stock over
approximately the prior 30 trading days, equal to the aggregate
exercise price of the warrants. The net result of this warrant
exercise was that Procter & Gamble acquired an
additional 938,875 shares of the Company’s Common
Stock. The 511,125 shares of Common Stock delivered to the
Company by Procter & Gamble were retired upon receipt.
These equity purchases were in addition to a purchase by
Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of
800,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for
$10.0 million that was completed in March 1997.

Effective December 31, 2000, the Company and
Procter & Gamble entered into a new collaboration
agreement, replacing the P&G Agreement. The new agreement
extends Procter & Gamble’s obligation to fund
Regeneron research through December 2005, with no further
research obligations by either party thereafter, and focuses the
companies’ collaborative research on therapeutic areas that
are of particular interest to Procter & Gamble. Under
the new agreement, research support from Procter &
Gamble is

F-25


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

$2.5 million per quarter, before adjustments for inflation,
through December 2005. Any drugs that result from the
collaboration will continue to be jointly developed and marketed
worldwide, with the companies equally sharing development costs
and profits. Procter & Gamble and the Company divided
rights to programs from the P&G Agreement that are no longer
part of the companies’ collaboration. Research funding from
Procter & Gamble related to the collaboration totaled
$90.8 million through December 31, 2004. In addition,
in 1997 through 1999, Procter & Gamble also provided
research support for the Company’s AXOKINE program and, as
a result, will be entitled to receive a small royalty on any
sales of AXOKINE.

Contract research and development revenue related to the
Company’s collaboration with Procter & Gamble was
$10.5 million, $10.6 million, and $10.5 million
in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. At December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, the Procter & Gamble contract
research revenue receivable was $2.3 million,
$2.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.

f.     Serono, S.A.

In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement (the
“Serono Agreement”) with Serono S.A. to use
Regeneron’s proprietary Velocigene technology platform to
provide Serono with knock-out and transgenic mammalian models of
gene function (“Materials”). Serono made an advance
payment of $1.5 million (the “Retainer”) to
Regeneron in December 2002, which was accounted for as deferred
revenue. Regeneron recognizes revenue and reduces the Retainer
as Materials are shipped to and accepted by Serono. The Serono
Agreement contains provisions for minimum yearly order
quantities and replenishment of the Retainer when the balance
declines below a specified threshold. In 2004 and 2003, the
Company recognized $2.1 million and $0.7 million,
respectively, of contract research and development revenue in
connection with the Serono Agreement.

12.

Manufacturing Agreement

During 1995, the Company entered into a long-term manufacturing
agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., as amended, (the
“Merck Agreement”) to produce an intermediate (the
“Intermediate”) for a Merck pediatric vaccine at the
Company’s Rensselaer, New York facility. The Company agreed
to modify portions of its facility for manufacture of the
Intermediate and to assist Merck in securing regulatory approval
for such manufacture in the Company’s facility. The Merck
Agreement calls for the Company to manufacture Intermediate for
Merck for a specified period of time (the “Production
Period”), with certain minimum order quantities each year.
The Production Period commenced in November of 1999 and
originally extended for six years. In February 2005, the Company
and Merck amended the Merck Agreement to extend the Production
Period through October 2006 and provide Merck an opportunity,
upon twelve-months’ prior notice, to extend the Production
Period for an additional year through October 2007. Merck may
terminate the agreement at any time upon the payment by Merck of
a termination fee.

Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the capital costs to
modify the facility (“Capital Costs”). Merck also
agreed to pay an annual facility fee (the “Facility
Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning March 1995, subject to
annual adjustment for inflation. During the Production Period,
Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for certain manufacturing
costs, pay the Company a variable fee based on the quantity of
Intermediate supplied to Merck, and make additional bi-annual
payments (“Additional Payments”), as defined. In
addition, Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the cost of
Company activities performed on behalf of Merck prior to the
Production Period and for miscellaneous costs during the
Production Period (“Internal Costs”). These payments
are recognized as contract manufacturing revenue as follows:
(i) payments for Internal Costs are recognized as the
activities are performed, (ii) the Facility Fee and
Additional Payments are recognized over the period to which they
relate, (iii) payments for Capital Costs were deferred and
are recognized as Intermediate is shipped to Merck, and
(iv) payments related to the

F-26

manufacture of Intermediate during the Production Period
(“Manufacturing Payments”) are recognized after the
Intermediate is tested and approved by, and shipped (FOB
Shipping Point) to, Merck.

In 2004, 2003, and 2002, Merck contract manufacturing revenue
totaled $18.1 million, $10.1 million, and
$11.1 million, respectively. Such amounts include
$3.6 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million of
previously deferred Capital Costs, respectively. In addition,
Merck contract manufacturing revenue for 2002 includes a
non-recurring $1.0 million payment received in August 2002
related to services the Company provided in prior years.

13.

Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans

a.     Long-Term Incentive
    Plans

During 2000, the Company established the Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2000
Incentive Plan”) which, as amended, provides for the
issuance of up to 18,500,000 shares of Common Stock in
respect of awards. In addition, shares of Common Stock
previously approved by shareholders for issuance under the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“1990 Incentive Plan”) that are not issued under the
1990 Incentive Plan, may be issued as awards under the 2000
Incentive Plan. Employees of the Company, including officers,
and nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members
of the Board of Directors, (collectively,
“Participants”) may receive awards as determined by a
committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The
awards that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include:
(a) Incentive Stock Options (“ISOs”) and
Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
(c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and
(e) Other Awards.

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right to purchase
shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the Committee;
however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise price will
not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common
Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest over a
period of time determined by the Committee, generally on a pro
rata basis over a three to five year period. The Committee also
determines the expiration date of each Option; however, no ISO
is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares of restricted
Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase such shares at a
price determined by the Committee. Such shares are
nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee
(“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as
defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the
Restricted Stock, which has not vested, will be transferred to
the Company, except under defined circumstances with Committee
approval, in consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the
Participant to acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company
requires a return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the
right to require a return of all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the right to
receive, within 30 days of the date on which the share
vests, an amount, in cash and/or shares of the Company’s
Common Stock as determined by the Committee, equal to the sum of
the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date
such share of Phantom Stock vests and the aggregate amount of
cash dividends paid with respect to a share of Common Stock
during the period from the grant date of the share of Phantom
Stock to the date on which the share vests. Stock Bonus awards
are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock which are granted
at the discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are valued based on
the Company’s Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of
the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions of such Other
Awards are determined solely on the authority of the Committee.

During 1990, the Company established the 1990 Incentive Plan
which, as amended, provided for a maximum of
6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of awards.
Employees of the Company, including

F-27


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

officers, and nonemployees, including consultants and
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors, received awards
as determined by a committee of independent directors. Under the
provisions of the 1990 Incentive Plan, there will be no future
awards from the plan. Awards under the 1990 Incentive Plan
consisted of Incentive Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock
Options which generally vest on a pro rata basis over a three or
five year period and have a term of ten years.

The 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans contain provisions that allow
for the Committee to provide for the immediate vesting of awards
upon a change in control of the Company, as defined.

The Company may incur charges to operations in connection with
awards from these Incentive Plans. In accordance with APB
No. 25 and related interpretations, the Company will record
compensation expense from employee stock-based awards under
certain conditions. Generally, when the terms of the award and
the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock are fixed,
compensation expense for options, restricted stock, and stock
bonus awards will total the grant date intrinsic value, if any,
amortized over the vesting period. For other awards, including
phantom stock, compensation expense will be recognized over the
life of the award based on the cash remitted to settle the award
or the intrinsic value of the award on the date of exercise.

Transactions involving stock option awards during 2004, 2003,
and 2002, under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans, are
summarized in the table below. Option exercise prices were
greater than or equal to the fair market value of the
Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The total
number of options exercisable at December 31, 2004, 2003,
and 2002 was 8,628,873, 5,940,268, and 4,670,695, respectively,
with weighted average exercise prices of $21.05, $19.45, and
$15.80, respectively.

The effect on the Company’s net loss and net loss per share
had compensation costs for the Incentive Plans been determined
in accordance with the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based compensation as prescribed by SFAS No. 123
is shown in Note 2. For the purpose of the pro forma
calculation, the fair value of each option granted from the
Incentive Plans during 2004, 2003, and 2002 was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
weighted-average fair value of the options granted during 2004,
2003, and 2002 was $7.53, $10.12 and $14.10, respectively. The
following table summarizes the assumptions used in computing the
fair value of option grants.

During 2004, 2003, and 2002, 105,052, 219,367, and
139,611 shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock were
awarded under the 2000 Incentive Plan. These shares are
nontransferable with such restriction lapsing (i) for 2004
awards with respect to 50% of the shares at nine months and
eighteen months from date of grant and (ii) for 2003 and
2002 awards with respect to 25% of the shares every six months
over the two-year period from date of grant. In accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, the Company recorded
unearned compensation within Stockholders’ Equity of
$1.0 million, $2.9 million, and $2.7 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, related to these awards.
This amount was based on the fair market value of shares of the
Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and will be
expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the period that the
restriction on these shares lapses. During 2004, 2003, and 2002,
18,194, 4,431, and 2,183 shares, respectively, of
Restricted Stock were forfeited due to employee terminations.
The Company reduced unearned compensation within
Stockholders’ Equity by $0.3 million,
$0.1 million, and $0.1 million in 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively, related to these forfeited awards.

The Company recognized compensation expense from stock-based
awards of $2.5 million $2.3 million, and
$1.8 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004, there were 5,553,915 shares
available for future grants under the 2000 Incentive Plan.

In December 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved a
stock option exchange program. Under the program, Company
regular employees who work an average of 20 hours per week,
other than the Company’s chairman and the Company’s
president and chief executive officer, were provided the
opportunity to make a

one-time election to surrender options granted under the 1990
and 2000 Incentive Plans that had an exercise price per share of
at least $18.00 and exchange them for replacement options
granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan in accordance with the
following exchange ratios:

Participation in the stock option exchange program was
voluntary, and non-employee directors, consultants, former
employees, and retirees were not eligible to participate. The
participation deadline for the program was January 5, 2005.
Eligible employees elected to exchange options with a total of
3,665,819 underlying shares of Common Stock, and the Company
issued 1,977,840 replacement options with an exercise price of
$8.50 per share on January 5, 2005.

Each replacement option was completely unvested upon grant. Each
replacement option granted to an employee other than our
executive vice president and senior vice presidents will
ordinarily become vested and exercisable with respect to
one-fourth of the shares initially underlying such option on
each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the
grant date so that such replacement option will be fully vested
and exercisable four years after it was granted. Each
replacement option granted to our executive vice president and
senior vice presidents will ordinarily vest with respect to all
the shares underlying such option if both (i) the
Company’s products have achieved gross sales of at least
$100 million during any consecutive twelve-month period
(either directly by the Company or through its licensees) and
(ii) the specific senior or executive vice president has
remained employed by the Company for at least three years from
the date of grant. For all replacement options, the
recipient’s vesting and exercise rights are contingent upon
the recipient’s continued employment through the applicable
vesting date and subject to the other terms of the 2000
Incentive Plan and the applicable option award agreement. As is
generally the case with respect to the option award agreements
for options that were eligible for exchange pursuant to the
stock option exchange program, the option award agreements for
replacement options include provisions whereby the replacement
options may become fully vested in connection with a
“Change in Control” of the Company, as defined in the
2000 Incentive Plan.

Under the stock option exchange program, each replacement option
has a term equal to the greater of (i) the remaining term
of the surrendered option it replaces and (ii) six years
from the date of grant of the replacement option. This was
intended to ensure that the employees who participated in the
stock option exchange program would not derive any additional
benefit from an extended option term unless the surrendered
option had a remaining term of less than six years.

In connection with the stock option exchange program, the
Company intends to adopt, effective January 1, 2005, the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as
modified by SFAS No. 148, using the modified prospective
method. In accordance with SFAS Nos. 123/148, as a result
of the Company’s grant of the replacement options pursuant
to the stock option exchange program, the Company incurred
compensation cost that will be recognized over the vesting
period of the replacement option. The compensation cost equals
the sum of (i) the unamortized fair value of the
surrendered options on the date of the exchange and
(ii) the incremental value of the replacement option
measured as the difference between (a) the fair value of

Company will begin recognizing this compensation cost in the
first quarter of 2005 in each of the categories of expense in
the Company’s Statement of Operations.

b.

Executive Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock Purchase Plan
(the “Plan”) under which 1,027,500 shares of
Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock awards.
The Plan provides for the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors to award employees, directors, consultants, and other
individuals (“Plan participants”) who render service
to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock at a
price set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides for
the vesting of shares as determined by the compensation
committee and, should the Company’s relationship with a
Plan participant terminate before all shares are vested,
unvested shares will be repurchased by the Company at a price
per share equal to the original amount paid by the Plan
participant. During 1989 and 1990, a total of
983,254 shares were issued, all of which vested as of
December 31, 1999. As of December 31, 2004, there were
44,246 shares available for future grants under the Plan.

14.

Employee Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of the Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Savings
Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide for employees
who have met defined service requirements to participate in the
Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the Savings Plan a
percentage of their compensation to be set aside to pay their
future retirement benefits, as defined. The Savings Plan, as
amended and restated during 1998, provides for the Company to
make discretionary contributions (“Contribution”), as
defined. The Company recorded Contribution expense of
$0.8 million in 2004, $0.9 million in 2003, and
$0.8 million in 2002; such amounts were accrued as
liabilities at December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. During the first quarter of 2005, 2004, and 2003,
the Company contributed 90,385, 64,333, and 42,543 shares,
respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings Plan in
satisfaction of these obligations.

15.

Income Taxes

In 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company recognized a net operating
loss for tax purposes and, accordingly, no provision for income
taxes has been recorded in the accompanying financial
statements. There is no benefit for federal or state income
taxes for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002
since the Company has incurred net operating losses for tax
purposes since inception and established a valuation allowance
equal to the total deferred tax asset.

The tax effect of temporary differences, net operating loss
carry-forwards, and research and experimental tax credit
carry-forwards as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was as
follows:

F-31


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per
share data)

For all years presented, the Company’s effective income tax
rate is zero. The difference between the Company’s
effective income tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 34%
is attributable to state tax benefits and tax credit
carry-forwards offset by an increase in the deferred tax
valuation allowance.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had available for tax
purposes unused net operating loss carry-forwards of
$339.5 million which will expire in various years from 2006
to 2024. The Company’s research and experimental tax credit
carry-forwards expire in various years from 2005 to 2024. Under
the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions,
substantial changes in the Company’s ownership have
resulted in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating
loss and tax credit carry-forwards that can be utilized in
future years to offset future taxable income. This annual
limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses
and tax credit carry-forwards before utilization.

16.

Legal Matters

In May 2003, securities class action lawsuits were commenced
against Regeneron and certain of the Company’s officers and
directors in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. A consolidated amended class action
complaint was filed in October 2003. The complaint, which
purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of
investors in the Company’s publicly traded securities
between March 28, 2000 and March 30, 2003, alleges
that the defendants misstated or omitted material information
concerning the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE, in violation of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Damages are
sought in an unspecified amount. The ultimate outcome of this
matter cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, no provision
for any liability that may result upon the resolution of this
matter has been made in the accompanying financial statements.

The Company, from time to time, has been subject to other legal
claims arising in connection with its business. While the
ultimate outcome of these other legal claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, at December 31, 2004 there were no such
other asserted claims against the Company which, in the opinion
of management, if adversely determined would have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations, and cash flows.

17.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

The Company’s basic net income (loss) per share amounts
have been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding.
The diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted
average number of shares of Common Stock and Class A Stock
and the common stock equivalents outstanding when dilutive. In
2003 and 2002, the Company reported net losses and, therefore,
no common stock equivalents were included in the computation of
diluted net loss per share since

such inclusion would have been antidilutive. The calculations of
basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:

Shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants,
vesting of restricted stock awards, and conversion of
convertible debt, which have been excluded from the diluted per
share amounts because their effect would have been antidilutive,
include the following:

In connection with the Company’s stock option exchange
program (see Note 13a), on January 5, 2005, eligible
employees elected to exchange options with a total of 3,665,819
underlying shares of Common Stock, and the Company issued
1,977,840 replacement options with an exercise price of
$8.50 per share.
