by law.

General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a
biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and intends
to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of
serious medical conditions. Our clinical and preclinical
pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of
cancer, diseases of the eye, rheumatoid arthritis and other
inflammatory conditions, allergies, asthma, obesity, and other
diseases and disorders. Developing and commercializing new
medicines entails significant risk and expense. Since inception
we have not generated any sales or profits from the
commercialization of any of our product candidates.

Our core business strategy is to combine our
strong foundation in basic scientific research and
discovery-enabling technology with our manufacturing and
clinical development capabilities to build a successful,
integrated biopharmaceutical company. Our efforts have yielded a
diverse and growing pipeline of product candidates that have the
potential to address a variety of unmet medical needs. We
believe that our ability to develop product candidates is
enhanced by the application of our technology platforms. These
platforms are designed to discover specific genes of therapeutic
interest for a particular disease or cell type and validate
targets through high-throughput production of mammalian models.
We continue to invest in the development of enabling
technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, and
commercialize new product candidates.

Below is a summary of our clinical programs.

•

VEGF TRAP:

Protein-based product candidate
    designed to bind Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (called
    VEGF, also known as Vascular Permeability Factor or VPF) and its
    relative, Placental Growth Factor (called PLGF), and prevent
    their interaction with cell surface receptors. VEGF (and to a
    less validated degree PLGF) is required for the growth of blood
    vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent
    regulator of vascular permeability and leakage. In 2001, we
    initiated a dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial designed to
    assess the safety and tolerability of the VEGF Trap in subjects
    with advanced solid tumor malignancies. This trial continues to
    test increasing doses of VEGF Trap delivered by subcutaneous
    injection as per the protocol and is expected to be completed in
    the first half of 2004. A second phase, expected to begin in the
    first half of 2004, will test higher doses of the VEGF Trap
    delivered intravenously. We are also evaluating the VEGF Trap
    for the potential treatment of certain eye diseases and in March
    2004, announced the initiation of a Phase I study of the VEGF
    Trap in patients with the neovascular or “wet” form of
    age-related macular degeneration.

In September 2003, we entered into a
    collaboration agreement with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. to
    jointly develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap in multiple
    oncology, ophthalmology, and possibly other indications
    throughout the world with the exception of Japan, where product
    rights remain with us. Aventis made a non-refundable up-front
    payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued
    unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $45.0 million.
    Under the collaboration agreement,





presenting the results at a scientific conference
    in the second quarter of 2004. We are also evaluating the
    potential use of the IL-4/13 Trap in other therapeutic
    indications.

•

AXOKINE®:

Protein-based product candidate
    designed to act on the brain region regulating appetite and
    energy expenditure. AXOKINE is being developed for the treatment
    of obesity. In March 2003, we reported data from the 12-month
    treatment period of our initial Phase III pivotal trial of
    AXOKINE. The double-blind treatment period in this study is
    being followed by a twelve-month open-label extension phase,
    during which all study subjects receive AXOKINE. The extension
    phase is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2004.
    We are currently conducting research on improving the
    formulation and delivery of AXOKINE and evaluating its
    commercial potential. We do not expect to initiate any Phase III
    clinical trials of AXOKINE in 2004.

Our Areas of Focus

Anti-Angiogenesis/Angiogenesis in Cancer
    and Other Settings: VEGF Trap and the
    Angiopoietins

Research.

A
plentiful blood supply is required to nourish every tissue and
organ of the body. Diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis
wreak their havoc, in part, by destroying blood vessels
(arteries, veins, and capillaries) and compromising blood flow.
Decreases in blood flow (known as ischemia) can result in
non-healing skin ulcers and gangrene, painful limbs that cannot
tolerate exercise, loss of vision, and heart attacks. In other
cases, disease processes can damage blood vessels by breaking
down vessel walls, resulting in defective and leaky vessels.
Leaking vessels can lead to swelling and edema, as occurs in
brain tumors following ischemic stroke, in diabetic retinopathy,
and in arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Finally, some
disease processes, such as tumor growth, depend on the induction
of new blood vessels.

In many clinical settings, positively or
negatively regulating blood vessel growth could have important
therapeutic benefits, as could the repair of damaged and leaky
vessels. Thus, building new vessels, by a process known as
angiogenesis, can improve circulation to ischemic limbs and the
heart, aid in healing skin ulcers or other chronic wounds, and
in establishing tissue grafts. Reciprocally, blocking
tumor-induced angiogenesis can blunt tumor growth. In addition,
repairing leaky vessels can reverse swelling and edema.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor was the first
growth factor shown to be specific for blood vessels, by virtue
of having its receptor specifically expressed on blood vessel
cells. In 1994, we discovered a second family of angiogenic
growth factors, termed the Angiopoietins, and we have received
patents covering the members of this family. The Angiopoietins
include naturally occurring positive and negative regulators of
angiogenesis, as described in numerous scientific manuscripts
published by our scientists and their collaborators. The
Angiopoietins are being evaluated in preclinical research by us
and our academic collaborators.

Our studies have revealed that VEGF and the
Angiopoietins normally function in a coordinated and
collaborative manner during blood vessel growth. Thus, for
example, the growth of new blood vessels to nourish ischemic
tissue appears to require both these agents. In addition,
Angiopoietin-1 seems to play a critical role in stabilizing the
blood vessel wall, and in animal models administration of this
growth factor can prevent or repair leaky vessels. In terms of
blocking vessel growth, manipulation of both VEGF and
Angiopoietins seems to be of value.

The approach of inhibiting angiogenesis as a
mechanism of action for an oncology medicine was further
validated in February 2004, when the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (or FDA) approved Genentech, Inc.’s VEGF
inhibitor, Avastin™. Avastin is an antibody product
designed to inhibit VEGF and interfere with the blood supply to
cancerous tumors. We exploited our Trap technology (which is
described below) to develop a protein-based blocker of VEGF,
referred to as the VEGF Trap.

Oncology.

Cancer is
a heterogeneous set of diseases and one of the leading causes of
death in the developed world. A mutation in any one of dozens of
normal genes can eventually lead a cell to become cancerous;
however, a common feature of cancer cells is that they need to
get nutrients and remove waste products, just as normal cells
do. The vascular system is designed to supply nutrients and
remove waste from normal tissues. Cancer cells can use the
vascular system either by taking over preexisting blood vessels
or by promoting the growth of new blood vessels. VEGF is
secreted by many tumors to stimulate the growth of new



blood vessels to support the tumor. Countering
the effects of VEGF, thus blocking the blood supply to tumors,
has been shown to provide therapeutic benefits.

Diseases of the Eye.

Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic
Retinopathy (DR) are two of the leading causes of adult
blindness in the developed world. In both conditions, severe
visual loss is caused by a combination of retinal edema and
neovascular proliferation. VEGF both stimulates angiogenesis and
increases vascular permeability, has been shown to be a major
pathogenic factor in both DR and AMD, and is believed to be
involved in other medical problems affecting the eyes.
Counteracting the effects of VEGF may provide a significant
therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from these disorders.

AMD is a leading cause of severe visual loss in
people over the age of 55 in developed countries. It is
estimated that, in the U.S., 6% of individuals aged 65-74 and
20% of those older than 75 are affected with AMD. DR is a major
complication of diabetes mellitus that can lead to significant
vision impairment. DR is characterized, in part, by vascular
leakage, which results in the collection of fluid in the retina.
When the macula, the central area that is responsible for fine
visual acuity, is involved, loss of visual acuity occurs. This
is referred to as Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). DME is the most
prevalent cause of moderate visual loss in patients with
diabetes.

Clinical Development — VEGF
Trap.

In November 2001, we initiated a
Phase I clinical trial designed to assess the safety and
tolerability of the VEGF Trap in subjects with solid tumor
malignancies. The Phase I trial is an open-label study in
subjects with advanced tumors and is evaluating the VEGF Trap at
increasing dose levels. The ongoing study is being conducted at
three clinical sites in the United States, and the trial is
expected to be completed in the first half of 2004. A second
phase, expected to begin in the first half of 2004, will test
higher doses of the VEGF Trap delivered intravenously. We are
also evaluating the VEGF Trap for the potential treatment of
certain diseases of the eye and in March 2004, announced the
initiation of a Phase I study of the VEGF Trap in patients with
the neovascular or “wet” form of age-related macular
degeneration.

In September 2003, we entered into a
Collaboration Agreement with Aventis to jointly develop and
commercialize the VEGF Trap in multiple oncology, ophthalmology,
and possibly other indications throughout the world with the
exception of Japan, where product rights remain with us. In
2004, we and Aventis plan to invest approximately
$100 million to support the development of the VEGF Trap.
The broad based development program will include multiple Phase
I studies to evaluate the VEGF Trap in combination with other
therapies in various cancer indications, Phase II single-agent
studies of the VEGF Trap in separate cancer indications, and
multiple Phase I studies of the VEGF Trap in certain eye
diseases.

Trap Technology and Additional
    Traps

Research.

Our
research on ciliary neurotrophic factor, or CNTF, led to the
discovery that CNTF, although it is a neurotrophic factor,
belongs to the “superfamily” of signaling molecules
called cytokines. Cytokines are soluble proteins secreted by the
cells of the body. In many cases, cytokines act as messengers to
help regulate immune and inflammatory responses. In excess,
cytokines can be harmful and have been linked to a variety of
diseases. Blocking cytokines and growth factors is a proven
therapeutic approach with a number of medicines or product
candidates already approved or in clinical development. The
cytokine superfamily includes factors such as erythropoietin,
thrombopoietin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and the
interleukins (or ILs).

During the 1990s, our scientists made a number of
breakthroughs in understanding how receptors work for an entire
family of cytokines, which had broad relevance for many other
families of cytokines and growth factors. Based on these
findings, we developed a new class of protein-based antagonists,
termed Traps, which could be designed to target and block
specific cytokines and growth factors implicated in human
disease. Examples include the VEGF Trap (designed to block VEGF
and PLGF), the IL-1 Trap (designed to block both IL-1 alpha and
IL-1 beta), the IL-4 Trap (designed to block IL-4), the IL-6
Trap (designed to block IL-6), the IL-18 Trap (designed to block
IL-18), and the IL-4/13 Trap (designed to block IL-4 and IL-13).



In preclinical studies, these Traps are more
potent than other growth factor and cytokine antagonists,
potentially allowing lower levels of these drug candidates to be
used. Moreover, because these Traps are comprised entirely of
natural human-derived protein sequences, they may be less likely
to induce an immune reaction in humans. Because pathological
levels of certain cytokines and growth factors seem to
contribute to a variety of diseases, our Traps have the
potential to be important therapeutic agents.

We have clinical programs underway for our IL-1
Trap and IL-4/13 Trap (see below) and research programs underway
for an IL-6 Trap and an IL-18 Trap. IL-6 has been implicated in
the pathology and progression of multiple myeloma, certain solid
tumors, AIDS, lymphomas (both AIDS-related and
non-AIDS-related), osteoporosis, and other conditions. IL-18 is
thought to contribute to a number of inflammatory and
immunological diseases and disorders. We also have patents
covering additional Traps for IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-15, and
others, which are being studied in earlier stage research
programs. Our research also includes molecular and cellular
research to improve or modify Trap technology, process
development efforts to produce experimental and clinical
research supplies, and in vivo and in vitro studies to further
understand and demonstrate the efficacy of the Traps.

Clinical Development.

IL-1 Trap.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease in which the immune
system attacks the tissue that lines and cushions joints. Over
time, the cartilage, bone, and ligaments of the joint erode,
leading to progressive joint deformity and joint destruction,
generally in the hand, wrist, knee, and foot. Joints become
painful and swollen and motion is limited. Over two million
people, 1% of the U.S. population, are estimated to have
rheumatoid arthritis, and 10% of those eventually become
disabled. Women account for roughly two-thirds of these patients.

In July 2002, we announced the initiation of a
dose-ranging Phase II study of the IL-1 Trap in subjects with
rheumatoid arthritis. This trial enrolled approximately 200
subjects who received weekly self-injections of one of three
fixed doses of IL-1 Trap or placebo for 12 weeks, followed
by 10 weeks of off-treatment follow-up. In October 2003, we
announced that in this trial the IL-1 Trap demonstrated evidence
of clinical activity and safety. Patients treated with the
highest dose, 100 milligrams of the IL-1 Trap, exhibited
non-statistically significant improvements in the proportion of
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 responses versus
placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. Patients treated
with the IL-1 Trap also exhibited improvements in secondary
endpoints of the trial. The IL-1 Trap was generally well
tolerated and was not associated with any drug-related serious
adverse events.

On February 27, 2004, we announced plans to
initiate a Phase IIb study of the IL-1 Trap in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of 2004. The Phase IIb
study will be conducted in a larger patient population, testing
higher doses and for a longer period of time than in the
previous Phase II trial. In addition, we intend to conduct
studies of the IL-1 Trap in a variety of other inflammatory
diseases where interleukin-1 is believed to play an important
role. We are currently working on new product formulations that
would allow delivery of higher doses of IL-1 Trap either through
subcutaneous or intravenous administration and plan to conduct
patient tolerability studies in the first half of 2004.

Since March 2003, we have been collaborating with
Novartis Pharma AG on the development of the IL-1 Trap. On
February 27, 2004, we announced that Novartis had provided
notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint
development of the IL-1 Trap. Under the terms of the
collaboration agreement, Novartis remains obligated to fund
agreed upon pre-Phase III IL-1 Trap development expenses
during the nine-month notice period before its voluntary
termination becomes effective. Novartis and we retain rights
under the collaboration agreement to elect to collaborate on the
development and commercialization of other IL-1 antagonists
being developed independently by the other party that are in
earlier stages of development than the IL-1 Trap.

IL-4/13 Trap.

One in
13 Americans suffers from allergies and one in 18 suffers from
asthma. The number of people afflicted with these diseases has
been growing at a fast rate. It is believed that IL-4 and IL-13
play a role in these diseases. These two cytokines are essential
to the normal functioning of the immune system, creating a vital
communication link between white blood cells. In the case of
asthma and allergies,



however, it is thought that excess levels of IL-4
and IL-13 causes overactivity of the immune system, which
contributes to disease initiation and progression.

Antagonists for IL-4 and IL-13 may be
therapeutically useful in a number of allergy and asthma-related
conditions, including as an adjunct to vaccines where blocking
IL-4 and IL-13 may help to elicit more of the desired type of
immune response to the vaccine. We have developed both an IL-4
Trap and an IL-4/13 Trap, which is a single molecule that can
block both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. In October 2002, we
initiated a placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose escalation
Phase I clinical trial designed to assess the safety and
tolerability of the IL-4/13 Trap in subjects with mild to
moderate asthma. The trial is expected to be completed in the
first quarter of 2004. We are also evaluating the potential use
of the IL-4/13 Trap in other therapeutic indications.

Obesity and Metabolic
    Diseases

Food intake and metabolism are regulated by
complex interactions between diverse neural and hormonal signals
that serve to maintain an optimal balance between energy intake,
storage, and utilization. The hypothalamus, a small area at the
base of the brain, is critically involved in the integration of
peripheral signals which reflect nutritional status and neural
outputs which regulate appetite, food seeking behaviors, and
energy expenditure. Obesity and related metabolic disorders,
such as type 2 diabetes, reflect a dysregulation in the
systems which ordinarily tightly couple energy intake to energy
expenditure. Our preclinical research program encompasses the
study of both central (neuropeptide) and peripheral
(hormonal) regulators of food intake and metabolism in
health and disease.

Obesity is a major health problem in all
developed countries. The prevalence of obesity in the United
States has increased substantially during the past decade. A
1999 Congressional Report funded by the National Institutes of
Health confirmed that obesity significantly increases a number
of health risks, including type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related
conditions, such as stroke and myocardial infarct are estimated
to contribute to about 300,000 deaths yearly, ranking second
only to smoking as a cause of preventable death. Several studies
published in 2002 demonstrate that even modest levels of weight
loss, when maintained over an extended period of time, can
significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2
diabetes. Health care expenditures for obesity-related
conditions now total over $200 billion a year in the United
States. Current treatment of obesity consists of diet, exercise,
and other lifestyle changes, and a limited number of medicines.
There are several approved medicines currently indicated for the
treatment of obesity, including sibutramine (Meridia®, a
registered trademark of Abbott Laboratories) and orlistat
(Xenical®, a registered trademark of Hoffmann-LaRoche,
Inc.).

Clinical Development —
AXOKINE.

We are developing AXOKINE for
the treatment of obesity. AXOKINE is our patented genetically
re-engineered form of CNTF. In March 2003, we reported data from
the 12-month treatment period of our initial Phase III
pivotal trial of AXOKINE. The double-blind treatment period in
this study is being followed by a twelve-month open-label
extension phase, during which all study subjects receive
AXOKINE. The extension phase is expected to be completed in the
first quarter of 2004.

Two AXOKINE trials remain ongoing. These trials,
which each include approximately 300 subjects, are evaluating
the safety of intermittent treatment with AXOKINE and studying
maintenance of weight loss following short-term treatment
regimens. Results from these trials are expected to be available
in mid-2004.

We are currently conducting research on improving
the formulation and delivery of AXOKINE and evaluating its
commercial potential. We do not expect to initiate any
Phase III clinical trials of AXOKINE in 2004.

Muscle Atrophy and Related
    Disorders

Muscle atrophy occurs in many neuromuscular
diseases and also when muscle is unused, as often occurs during
prolonged hospital stays and during convalescence. Currently,
physicians have few options to treat subjects with muscle
atrophy or other muscle conditions which afflict millions of
people globally. Thus, a



treatment that has beneficial effects on skeletal
muscle could have significant clinical benefit. Our muscle
program is currently focused on conducting in vivo and
in vitro experiments with the objective of demonstrating
and further understanding the molecular pathways involved in
muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, and discovering therapeutic
candidates that can modulate these pathways. This work is being
conducted in collaboration with scientists at The
Procter & Gamble Company.

Cartilage Growth Factor System and
    Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis results from the wearing down of
the articular cartilage surfaces that cover joints. Thus, growth
factors that specifically act on cartilage cells could have
utility in osteoarthritis. Our scientists have discovered a
growth factor receptor system selectively expressed by cartilage
cells, termed Regeneron Orphan Receptor 2 (ROR2). We have
also demonstrated that this growth factor receptor system is
required for normal cartilage development in mice. In addition,
together with collaborators, we have demonstrated that mutations
in this growth factor receptor system cause inherited defects in
cartilage development in humans. Thus, this growth factor
receptor system is a promising new target for cartilage diseases
such as osteoarthritis, but we have not yet identified any
therapeutic molecules from our research to advance to clinical
development.

Fibrosis

Fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis, result from
the excess production of fibrous extracellular matrix by certain
cell types. We and our collaborators identified orphan
receptors, termed Discoidin Domain Receptors 1 and 2 (DDR1
and DDR2), that are expressed by the activated cell types in
fibrotic disease. Our work in this area is currently focused on
determining whether selective inhibition or activation of DDR1
and DDR2 would be beneficial in the setting of fibrotic disease.
Further, we are studying key signaling pathways which allow
particular fibrosis-inducing cells to multiply. Inhibition of
such pathways may be useful in preventing the development of
fibrosis. These research activities are being conducted in
collaboration with scientists at Procter & Gamble.

G-Protein Coupled Receptors

G-Protein Coupled Receptors have historically
been among the most useful targets for pharmaceuticals. We use a
genomics approach to discover new G-Protein Coupled Receptors
and then we characterize these receptors in our disease models
by examining their expression. Early stage research work on
selected G-Protein Coupled Receptors is being conducted in
collaboration with scientists at Procter & Gamble.

Technology Platforms

Our ability to discover and develop product
candidates for a wide variety of serious medical conditions
results from the leveraging of our powerful technology
platforms, many of which were developed or enhanced by us.
Although the primary use of these technology platforms is for
our own research and development programs, we are also exploring
the possibilities of exploiting these technologies commercially
through, for example, direct licensing or sale of technology, or
the establishment of research collaborations to discover and
develop drug targets. In December 2002, we entered into an
agreement with Serono S.A. to use excess capacity from our
Velocigene™ technology platform to provide Serono with
knock-out and transgenic mammalian models of gene function.
Under the agreement, which was amended as of January 1,
2004 to expand the scope of services available under the
Velocigene platform, Serono will pay us up to $4.0 million
annually for up to five years.

Targeted
Genomics™

. In contrast to
basic genomics approaches, which attempt to identify every gene
in a cell or genome, we use Targeted Genomics approaches to
identify specific genes likely to be of therapeutic interest.
These approaches do not depend on random gene sequencing, but
rather on function-based approaches to specifically target the
discovery of genes for growth factors, peptides, and their
receptors that are most likely to have use for developing drug
candidates. This technology has already led to our discovery of
the Angiopoietin and Ephrin growth factor families for
angiogenesis and vascular disorders, the MuSK growth



factor receptor system for muscle disorders, and
the Regeneron Orphan Receptor (ROR) growth factor receptor
system that regulates cartilage formation.

Velocigene™

.
A major challenge facing the biopharmaceutical industry in the
post-genomic era is the efficient assignment of function to
random gene sequences to enable the identification of validated
drug targets. One way to help determine the function of a gene
is to generate mammalian models in which the gene is removed
(referred to as “knock-out mammalian models”), or is
over-produced (referred to as “transgenic mammalian
models”), or in which a color-producing gene is substituted
for the gene of interest (referred to as “reporter knock-in
mammalian models”) to identify which cells in the model
system are expressing the gene. Until recently, technical
hurdles involved in the generation of mammalian models
restricted the ability to produce multiple models quickly and
efficiently. We have developed proprietary technology that
allows for the rapid and efficient production of models on a
high throughput scale, enabling rapid assignment of function to
gene sequences.

Designer Protein
Therapeutics™

. In cases in
which the natural gene product is itself not a product
candidate, we utilize our Designer Protein Therapeutics platform
to genetically engineer product candidates with the desired
properties. We use these technologies to develop derivatives of
growth factors and their receptors, which can allow for modified
agonistic or antagonistic properties that may prove to be
therapeutically useful. This technology platform has already
produced more than 10 patented proteins, including the
VEGF Trap and the IL-1 Trap, which are currently in
clinical testing, and several others in preclinical development.

Our Collaborative Programs

We have entered into collaboration and licensing
agreements with various companies, including Aventis, Novartis,
Procter & Gamble, Amgen Inc., Sumitomo Chemical
Company, Ltd., Medarex, Inc., Emisphere Technologies, Inc., and
Nektar Therapeutics. In addition, we conduct many research
programs in collaboration with academic partners. In the future,
we may enter into additional strategic collaborations or
licensing agreements focusing on one or more of our product
candidates, research programs, or technology platforms. Below
are summaries of our major collaborations.

Aventis.

In
September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement
with Aventis to jointly develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap.
Aventis made a non-refundable up-front payment of
$80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued
unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $45.0 million.

Under the collaboration agreement, we and Aventis
will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of
the VEGF Trap. Aventis has agreed to make a $25.0 million
payment to us upon achievement of an early-stage clinical
milestone. We may also receive up to $360.0 million in
additional milestone payments upon receipt of specified
marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF Trap indications in
Europe or the United States. Regeneron has agreed to continue to
manufacture clinical supplies of the VEGF Trap at our plant in
Rensselaer, New York. Aventis has agreed to be responsible for
providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the VEGF
Trap.

Under the collaboration agreement, agreed upon
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
of the agreement will be funded by Aventis. If the collaboration
becomes profitable, we will reimburse Aventis for 50 percent of
the VEGF Trap development expenses in accordance with a formula
based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the
collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option.

Aventis has the right to terminate the agreement
without cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
obligation to reimburse Aventis for 50 percent of the VEGF
Trap development expenses will also terminate and we will retain
all rights to the VEGF Trap.

Novartis.

In
March 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the
IL-1 Trap. Novartis made a non-refundable up-front payment
of $27.0 million and purchased 7,527,050 newly issued
unregistered shares of our common stock for $48.0 million.



Development expenses incurred during 2003 were
shared equally by us and Novartis. We funded our share of 2003
expenses through a loan from Novartis that will be forgiven,
together with accrued interest, should certain preclinical and
clinical milestones be reached, and is otherwise due and payable
on July 1, 2004.

On February 27, 2004, we announced that
Novartis had provided notice of its intention not to proceed
with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap. Under the
terms of the collaboration agreement, Novartis remains obligated
to fund agreed upon pre-Phase III IL-1 Trap
development expenses during the nine-month notice period before
its voluntary termination becomes effective. Novartis and we
retain rights under the collaboration agreement to elect to
collaborate on the development and commercialization of other
IL-1 antagonists being developed independently by the other
party that are in earlier stages of development than the
IL-1 Trap.

Procter &
Gamble.

In May 1997, we
entered into a long-term collaboration agreement with
Procter & Gamble to discover, develop, and
commercialize pharmaceutical products. In connection with the
collaboration, Procter & Gamble made equity purchases
of our Common Stock of $42.9 million in June 1997 and
$17.1 million in August 2000. These equity purchases
were in addition to a purchase by Procter & Gamble of
$10.0 million of our common stock that was completed in
March 1997. Procter & Gamble also agreed to
provide funding in support of our research efforts related to
the collaboration, of which we received $80.0 million
through December 31, 2003. From 1997 to 1999,
Procter & Gamble also provided research support for our
AXOKINE program. As a result, Procter & Gamble will be
entitled to receive a small royalty on any sales of AXOKINE.

In August 2000, Procter & Gamble
made two non-recurring research progress payments to us totaling
$3.5 million. Effective December 31, 2000, we and
Procter & Gamble entered into a new long-term
collaboration agreement, replacing the companies’ 1997
agreement. The new agreement extended Procter &
Gamble’s obligation to fund our research under the new
collaboration agreement through December 2005, with no
further research obligations by either party thereafter, and
focused the companies’ collaborative research on
therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to
Procter & Gamble, including muscle atrophy and muscle
diseases, fibrotic diseases, and selected G-Protein Coupled
Receptors. For each of these program areas, the parties
contribute research activities and necessary intellectual
property rights pursuant to mutually agreed upon plans and
budgets established by operating committees. During the first
five years of the agreement, neither party may independently
perform research on targets included in the collaboration.

We and Procter & Gamble divided rights
to the programs from the 1997 collaboration agreement that are
no longer part of the companies’ collaboration.
Procter & Gamble obtained rights to certain early stage
programs. We have rights to all other research programs
including exclusive rights to the VEGF Trap, the Angiopoietins,
and our Orphan Receptors (RORs). Any product candidates that
result from the new collaboration will continue to be jointly
developed and marketed worldwide, with the companies equally
sharing development costs and profits. Under the new agreement,
beginning in the first quarter of 2001, research support from
Procter & Gamble is $2.5 million per quarter
(before adjustments for inflation) through December 2005.

The new collaboration agreement expires on the
later of December 31, 2005 or the termination of research,
development, or commercial activities relating to compounds that
meet predefined success criteria before that date. In addition,
if either party successfully develops a compound covered under
the agreement to a predefined development stage during the
two-year period following December 31, 2005, the parties
shall meet to determine whether to reconvene joint development
of the compound under the agreement. The agreement is also
subject to termination if either party enters bankruptcy,
breaches its material obligations, or undergoes a change of
control. In addition to termination rights, our new
collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble has an
“opt-out” provision, whereby a party may decline to
participate further in a research or product development
program. In such cases, the opting-out party generally does not
have any further funding obligation and will not have any rights
to the product or program in question (but may be entitled to a
royalty on any product sales). If Procter & Gamble opts out
of a product development program, and we do not find a new
partner, we would bear the full cost of the program.



Manufacturing

We maintain an 8,000 square foot
manufacturing facility in Tarrytown, New York. This facility,
designed to comply with FDA current good manufacturing practices
(GMP), produces preclinical and clinical supplies of our product
candidates.

In 1993, we purchased our 104,000 square
foot Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facility, and in
2003 completed a 19,500 square foot expansion. This
facility is used to manufacture therapeutic candidates for our
own preclinical and clinical studies. We also use the facility
to manufacture a product for Merck & Co., Inc. under a
contract that expires in 2005. In July 2002, we leased
75,000 square feet in a building near our Rensselaer
facility which is being used for the manufacture of Traps and
for warehouse space. As of December 31, 2003, there were no
impairment losses associated with long-lived assets.

At December 31, 2003, we employed 274 people
in our manufacturing operations at these facilities.

In 1995, we entered into a long-term
manufacturing agreement with Merck (called, as amended, the
Merck Agreement) to produce an intermediate for a Merck
pediatric vaccine at our Rensselaer facility. We agreed to
modify portions of our facility for manufacture of the Merck
intermediate and to assist Merck in securing regulatory approval
for manufacturing in the Rensselaer facility. In
December 1999, we announced that the FDA had approved us as
a contract manufacturer for the Merck intermediate. Under the
Merck Agreement, we are manufacturing intermediate for Merck for
six years, with certain minimum order quantities each year. The
Merck Agreement extends through 2005, but may be terminated at
any time by Merck upon one year’s notice and may be
extended by mutual agreement. Merck reimbursed us for the
capital costs to modify the facility and for the cost of our
activities performed on behalf of Merck prior to the start of
production. Merck pays an annual facility fee of
$1.0 million, subject to annual adjustment for inflation,
reimburses us for certain manufacturing costs, pays us a
variable fee based on the quantity of intermediate supplied to
Merck, and makes certain additional payments. We recognized
contract manufacturing revenue related to the Merck Agreement of
$10.1 million in 2003, $11.1 million in 2002, and
$9.8 million in 2001.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing
approval of a medicine is the requirement that the prospective
manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
conform to the GMP regulations of the health authority. In
complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in
the area of production and quality control to ensure full
technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign
and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the
authority of the FDA and by other national, federal, state, and
local agencies. If our manufacturing facilities fail to comply
with FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be required
to suspend manufacturing. This will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and
cash flow.

Competition

There is substantial competition in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and chemical companies. Our competitors may
include Genentech, Novartis, Pfizer Inc., Hoffmann-LaRoche,
Abbott Laboratories, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Merck, Amgen, and
others. Many of our competitors have substantially greater
research, preclinical, and clinical product development and
manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human
resources than we do. Our smaller competitors may also be
significant if they acquire or discover patentable inventions,
form collaborative arrangements, or merge with large
pharmaceutical companies. Even if we achieve product
commercialization, one or more of our competitors may achieve
product commercialization earlier than we do or obtain patent
protection that dominates or adversely affects our activities.
Our ability to compete will depend on how fast we can develop
safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing
and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the
product to the market. Competition among product candidates
approved for sale will also be based on efficacy, safety,
reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other
factors.

VEGF Trap.

Many
companies are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block
the actions of VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A
variety of approaches have been employed, including



antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to the VEGF
receptor, small molecule antagonists to the VEGF receptor
tyrosine kinase, as well as multiple other anti-angiogenesis
strategies. Many of these alternative approaches may offer
competitive advantages to our VEGF Trap in efficacy, side-effect
profile, or form of delivery. Additionally, many of these
developmental molecules may be at a more advanced stage of
development than our product candidate. In particular, Genentech
recently was granted approval by the FDA to market and sell
Avastin™, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF. The marketing
approval for Avastin may make it more difficult for us to enroll
patients in clinical trials to support the VEGF Trap. This may
delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and
commercialize the VEGF Trap. In addition, Eyetech
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has successfully advanced its clinical
candidate for eye diseases, Macugen, through Phase II/III
trials. Eyetech is collaborating with Pfizer to develop and
commercialize Macugen. If they receive approval to market
Macugen for eye diseases, it would be more difficult for us to
enroll patients in clinical trials for the VEGF Trap in eye
diseases. This may delay or impair our ability to successfully
develop and commercialize the VEGF Trap.

Cytokine Traps.

Marketed products for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and
asthma are available as either oral or inhaled medicines,
whereas our Cytokine Traps currently are only planned for
clinical trials as injectibles. The markets for both rheumatoid
arthritis and asthma are very competitive. Several new, highly
successful medicines are available for these diseases. Examples
include the TNF-antagonists Enbrel® (a registered trademark
of Amgen), Remicade® (a registered trademark of Centocor),
and Humira® (a registered trademark of Abbott) for
rheumatoid arthritis, and the leukotriene-modifier
Singulair® (a registered trademark of Merck), as well as
various inexpensive corticosteroid medicines for asthma. The
availability of highly effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists
makes it more difficult to successfully develop the
IL-1 Trap for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It
will be difficult to enroll patients with rheumatoid arthritis
to participate in clinical trials of the IL-1 Trap, which
may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop the drug
candidate. In addition, even if the IL-1 Trap is ever
approved for sale, it will be difficult for our drug to compete
against these FDA approved TNF-antagonists because doctors and
patients will have significant experience using these effective
medicines.

AXOKINE.

There is
substantial competition in the discovery and development of
treatments for obesity, as well as established, cost-effective,
and emerging prescription and over-the-counter treatments for
this condition. For example, Hoffmann-LaRoche and Abbott already
market well-established medicines for the treatment of obesity
and Amgen, Sanofi-Synthelabo, and a number of other
pharmaceutical companies are developing new potential
therapeutics. Sanofi-Synthelabo has a cannaboid receptor
antagonist in Phase III clinical development. In
March 2004, Sanofi-Synthelabo reported that patients
treated with this clinical candidate demonstrated significant
weight loss in completed Phase III clinical trials. Many of
these medicines or therapeutic candidates appear to offer
competitive advantages over AXOKINE. For example, AXOKINE
currently is available only in injectible form, while the
currently available marketed medicines for the treatment of
obesity and Sanofi-Synthelabo’s product candidate are
delivered in pill (or oral dosage) forms, which generally are
favored by people over injectible medicines. Therefore, even if
AXOKINE is approved for sale, the fact that it must be delivered
by injection may severely limit its market acceptance among
patients and physicians.

Other Areas.

Many
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to
discover and develop small-molecule based therapeutics, similar
in at least certain respects to our program with
Procter & Gamble. In these and related areas,
intellectual property rights have been sought and certain rights
have been granted to competitors and potential competitors of
ours, and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in
such areas as a result of, among other things, our lack of
experience, trained personnel, and expertise. A number of
corporate and academic competitors are involved in the discovery
and development of novel therapeutics using tyrosine kinase
receptors, orphan receptors, and compounds that are the focus of
other research or development programs we are now conducting.
These competitors include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many
others. Many firms and entities are engaged in research and
development in the areas of cytokines, interleukins,
angiogenesis, and muscle conditions. Some of these competitors
are currently conducting advanced preclinical and clinical
research programs in these areas. These and other competitors
may have established substantial intellectual property and other
competitive advantages.



If a competitor announces a successful clinical
study involving a product that may be competitive with one of
our product candidates or an approval by a regulatory agency of
the marketing of a competitive product, such announcement may
have a material adverse effect on our operations, or future
prospects, or the price of our common stock.

We also compete with academic institutions,
governmental agencies, and other public or private research
organizations, which conduct research, seek patent protection,
and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and
marketing of products that would provide royalties for use of
their technology. These institutions are becoming more active in
seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect
royalties for use of the technology that they have developed.
Products developed in this manner may compete directly with
products we develop. We also compete with others in acquiring
technology from such institutions, agencies, and organizations.

Patents, Trademarks, and Trade
Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to
obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate
without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.
Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology,
inventions, and improvements that we consider important to the
development of our business. We have been granted approximately
100 U.S. patents and we have approximately 100 pending
U.S. applications. We are the nonexclusive licensee of a
number of additional U.S. patents and patent applications.
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing
technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive
position. We or our licensors or collaborators have filed patent
applications on products and processes relating to AXOKINE,
Cytokine Traps, VEGF Trap, and Angiopoietins, as well as other
technologies and inventions in the United States and in certain
foreign countries. We intend to file additional patent
applications, when appropriate, relating to improvements in
these technologies and other specific products and processes. We
plan to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents
and other proprietary technology.

In July 2002, we announced that Amgen and
Immunex Corporation (now part of Amgen) granted us a
non-exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications
which may be used in the development and commercialization of
the IL-1 Trap. The license followed two other licensing
arrangements under which we obtained a non-exclusive license to
patents owned by ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Tularik Inc. for use in
connection with the IL-1 Trap program. These license
agreements would require us to pay royalties based on the net
sales of the IL-1 Trap if and when it is approved for sale.
In total, the royalty rate under these three agreements would be
in the mid-single digits.

In August 2003, Merck granted us a
non-exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications
which may be used in the development and commercialization of
AXOKINE. In consideration for the license, we issued to Merck
109,450 newly issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock and
agreed to make an additional payment to Merck if the fair market
value of the shares falls below a certain threshold at the time
that Merck has the right to sell them. We agreed to make an
additional payment upon receipt of marketing approval for a
product covered by the licensed patents and pay royalties, at
staggered rates in the mid-single digits, based on the net
sales, if any, of products covered by the licensed patents.

Patent law relating to the patentability and
scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our
patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty. Others
may independently develop similar products or processes to those
developed by us, duplicate any of our products or processes or,
if patents are issued to us, design around any products and
processes covered by our patents. We expect to continue to file
product and process patent applications with respect to our
inventions. However, we may not file any such applications or,
if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or
licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of
others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual
property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the
outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued
to or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a
court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of
third parties, or that we may



have to alter or discontinue the development of
our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent
rights of third parties.

Government Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the
United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in
the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of our
product candidates. All of our product candidates will require
regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In
particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous
preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-market approval
requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of
the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign
pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during
recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a
number of forums. The ultimate outcome and impact of such
reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted.

The activities required before a product
candidate may be marketed in the United States begin with
preclinical tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory
evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety
and efficacy of the product candidate and its formulations. The
results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of
an Investigational New Drug Application, which must be reviewed
by the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin.
Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In
Phase I, trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to
determine the early safety profile of the product candidate. In
Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted
with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to
evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
different potential doses of the product candidate. In Phase
III, large-scale clinical trials are conducted with patients
afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to
provide enough data to understand the efficacy and safety
profile of the product candidate, as required by the FDA. The
results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic
product candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a
Biologics License Application, or BLA, for evaluation to
determine whether the product candidate may be approved for
commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant
marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the
application.

Any approval required by the FDA for any of our
product candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at
all. The designation of a clinical trial as being of a
particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial
will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular
phase, and a clinical trial may contain elements of more than
one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being
of a particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or
early stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or
efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more
broadly in humans.

Various federal and state statutes and
regulations also govern or influence the research, manufacture,
safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport,
or other aspects of such product candidates. The lengthy process
of seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable
statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial
resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees
to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could
adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of our products
and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and
future business will be subject to regulation under the United
States Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, national restrictions, and other present and potential
future local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had 644
full-time employees, of whom 110 held a Ph.D. or M.D. degree or
both. We believe that we have been successful in attracting
skilled and experienced personnel in a highly competitive
environment; however, competition for these personnel is
intense. None of our personnel are



covered by collective bargaining agreements and
our management considers its relations with our employees to be
good.

Available Information

We file annual, quarterly, and current reports,
proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any
materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public
Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW,
Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on
the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that
contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other
information regarding issuers, including Regeneron, that file
electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents
that we file with the SEC at

http://www.sec.gov

.

We also intend to make available free of charge
on or through our Internet website

(http://www.regn.com)

our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if
applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as
soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Item 2.

Properties

We conduct our research, development,
manufacturing, and administrative activities at our owned and
leased facilities. We currently lease approximately 220,000
square feet, and sublease approximately 16,000 square feet, of
laboratory, office, and manufacturing space in Tarrytown, New
York. The sublease will convert to a direct lease with the
landlord on December 31, 2005. We own a facility in
Rensselaer, New York, consisting of two buildings totaling
approximately 123,500 square feet of research, manufacturing,
office, and warehouse space. We also lease an additional 75,000
square feet of manufacturing, office, and warehouse space in
Rensselaer.

The following table summarizes the information
regarding our current property leases:

(1)

Excludes additional rental charges for utilities,
    taxes, and operating expenses, as defined.

In the future, we may lease, operate, or purchase
additional facilities in which to conduct expanded research and
development activities and manufacturing and commercial
operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In May 2003, securities class action lawsuits
were commenced against Regeneron and certain of its officers and
directors in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. A consolidated amended class action
complaint was filed in October 2003. The complaint, which
purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of
investors in our publicly traded securities between
March 28, 2000 and March 30, 2003, alleges that the
defendants misstated or omitted material information concerning
the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE, in violation of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Damages are
sought in an unspecified amount. We believe that the lawsuit is
without merit and, in December 2003, we filed a motion to
dismiss the lawsuit. Because we do not believe that a loss is
probable, no legal reserve has been established.



From time to time we are a party to other legal
proceedings in the course of our business. Currently, we do not
expect any other legal proceedings to have a material adverse
effect on our business or financial condition.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity
    and Related Stockholder Matters

Our Common Stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Stock
Market under the symbol “REGN.” Our Class A
Stock, par value $.001 per share, is not publicly quoted or
traded.

The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, the range of high and low sales prices for the Common
Stock as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market.

As of March 3, 2004, there were 635
shareholders of record of our Common Stock and 56 shareholders
of record of our Class A Stock. The closing bid price for
the Common Stock on that date was $15.00.

We have never paid cash dividends and do not
anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.

The information called for with respect to equity
compensation plans is incorporated by reference to the material
captioned “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in
our definitive proxy statement with respect to our 2004 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders to be filed with the SEC.

In March 2003, we entered into a collaboration
agreement with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the
IL-1 Trap. In connection with this agreement, we sold to
Novartis 7,527,050 newly issued unregistered shares of our
Common Stock for a purchase price of $48.0 million. We
expect to use the proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock to
fund working capital and general corporate purposes.

In August 2003, Merck granted us a non-exclusive
license to certain patents and patent applications which may be
used in the development and commercialization of AXOKINE. As
consideration for this license, we issued to Merck 109,450 newly
issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock.

In September 2003, we entered into a
collaboration agreement with Aventis to jointly develop and
commercialize the VEGF Trap. In connection with this agreement,
we sold to Aventis 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of
our Common Stock for a purchase price of $45.0 million. We
expect to use the proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock to
fund working capital and general corporate purposes.

We view each of the aforementioned issuances as
transactions not involving any public offering and therefore as
exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company that
discovers, develops, and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical
products for the treatment of serious medical conditions. We are
currently conducting clinical programs for four product
candidates, which are in various stages of development:

In addition to our clinical programs, we have
research programs focused on angiogenesis, metabolic diseases,
muscle atrophy and related disorders, inflammatory conditions,
and other diseases and disorders. We also use our Velocigene and
Trap technology platforms to discover and develop new product
candidates.

Developing and commercializing new medicines
entails significant risk and expense. Since inception we have
not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of
any of our product candidates and may never receive such
revenues. Before revenues from the commercialization of our
product candidates can be realized, we (or our collaborators)
must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully
completing research and development and obtaining regulatory
approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other
countries. In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new
developments may render our products and technologies
uncompetitive or obsolete.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through
December 31, 2003, we had a cumulative loss of
$531.5 million. In the absence of revenues from the
commercialization of our product candidates or other sources,
the amount, timing, nature, or source of which cannot be
predicted, our losses will continue as we conduct our research
and development activities. We expect to incur substantial
losses over the next several years as we:

Our activities may expand over time and may
require additional resources, and we expect our operating losses
to be substantial over at least the next several years. Our
losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter



and will depend, among other factors, on the
progress of our research and development efforts, the timing of
certain expenses, and the amount and timing of payments that we
receive from collaborators.

As a company that does not expect to generate
product revenues or profits over the next several years,
management of cash flow is extremely important. The most
significant use of our cash is for research and development
activities, which include drug discovery, preclinical studies,
clinical trials, and the manufacture of drug supplies for
preclinical studies and clinical trials. In 2003, our research
and development expenses totaled $136.0 million. We expect
these expenses to increase 15-30% in 2004, depending on the
progress of our clinical programs. The principal sources of cash
to-date have been sales of common equity and convertible debt
and funding from our collaborators in the form of up-front
payments, research progress payments, contract research and
development, purchases of our common stock, and loans. We also
receive revenue from contract manufacturing.

A primary driver of our expenses is our number of
full-time employees. Our annual average headcount in 2003 was
675 compared to 643 in 2002 and 550 in 2001. In 2004, we expect
our average headcount to increase to between 730 and 750,
primarily to support our VEGF Trap and IL-1 Trap
clinical programs. In 2003, payroll and related costs accounted
for 36% of our total operating expenses. We expect this ratio to
decline in 2004, as our clinical expenses grow.

The planning, execution, and results of our
clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our
operating and financial results. In our four clinical programs,
key 2003 events and 2004 plans are as follows:

In September 2003, we entered into a major
collaboration agreement with Aventis to collaborate on the
development and commercialization of the VEGF Trap. Aventis made
a non-refundable up-front payment of



$80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552 newly
issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock for
$45.0 million.

Under the collaboration agreement, we and Aventis
will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of
the VEGF Trap. Aventis has agreed to make a $25.0 million
payment to us upon achievement of an early-stage clinical
milestone. We may also receive up to $360.0 million in
additional milestone payments upon receipt of specified
marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF Trap indications in
Europe or the United States. Regeneron has agreed to continue to
manufacture clinical supplies of the VEGF Trap at our plant in
Rensselaer, New York. Aventis has agreed to be responsible for
providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the VEGF
Trap.

Under the collaboration agreement, agreed upon
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
of the agreement will be funded by Aventis. If the collaboration
becomes profitable, we will reimburse Aventis for
50 percent of the VEGF Trap development expenses in
accordance with a formula based on the amount of development
expenses and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a
faster rate at our option.

Aventis has the right to terminate the agreement
without cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining
obligation to reimburse Aventis for 50 percent of the VEGF
Trap development expenses will also terminate and we will retain
all rights to the VEGF Trap.

In March 2003, we entered into a collaboration
agreement with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the
IL-1 Trap. Novartis made a non-refundable payment of
$27.0 million and purchased 7,527,050 newly issued
unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $48.0 million.
On February 27, 2004, we announced that Novartis had
provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint
development of the IL-1 Trap. Under the terms of the
collaboration agreement, Novartis remains obligated to fund
agreed upon pre-Phase III IL-1 Trap development
expenses during the nine-month notice period before its
voluntary termination becomes effective. Novartis and we retain
rights under the collaboration agreement to elect to collaborate
on the development and commercialization of other IL-1
antagonists being developed independently by the other party
that are in earlier stages of development than the
IL-1 Trap.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2003 and

Revenues:

Revenues in the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 consist of the following:

Our total revenue increased to $57.5 million
in 2003 from $22.0 million in 2002 primarily from the
recognition of $21.4 million of revenue related to our
collaboration with Novartis on the IL-1 Trap and
$14.3 million of revenue related to our collaboration with
Aventis on the VEGF Trap. This collaboration revenue, as
detailed below, consists partly of reimbursement for research
and development expenses and partly of the recognition of
revenue related to non-refundable up-front payments.
Non-refundable up-front payments



are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized
ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform
services in accordance with SAB 104 (see Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates).

Contract manufacturing revenue relates primarily
to our long-term agreement with Merck, which expires in October
of 2005, unless extended by mutual agreement, to manufacture a
vaccine intermediate at our Rensselaer, New York facility.
Contract manufacturing revenue decreased to $10.1 million
in 2003 from $11.1 million in 2002, due primarily to the
receipt of a non-recurring $1.0 million payment in the
third quarter of 2002 related to services we provided to Merck
in prior years. Revenue and the related manufacturing expense
are recognized as product is shipped, after acceptance by Merck.
Included in contract manufacturing revenue in 2003 and 2002 are
$1.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of
deferred revenue associated with capital improvement
reimbursements paid by Merck prior to commencement of
production. This deferred revenue is being recognized as product
is shipped to Merck based on the total amount of product
expected to be shipped over the life of the agreement.

Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses increased to
$136.0 million in 2003 from $125.0 million in 2002,
due primarily to (i) a $4.5 million increase in
payroll related expenses associated with an increase in
research, regulatory, and manufacturing personnel, (ii) a
$6.3 million increase in lab supply, outside testing, and
research contract expenses, and (iii) a $9.0 million
increase in facility expenses such as rent, utilities,
insurance, and depreciation. These facility related increases
were due primarily to the costs associated with the plant
expansion in Rensselaer which was completed in 2003 and the
leasing of additional warehouse and manufacturing facilities in
Rensselaer and office and lab space in Tarrytown during the
third quarter of 2002. These increases were partially offset by
an $8.8 million decrease in clinical expenses, due
primarily to the completion of the double-blind treatment
portion of the AXOKINE Phase III trial for the treatment of
obesity in January of 2003.

Contract Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses increased to
$6.7 million in 2003, compared to $6.5 million in
2002, primarily because we shipped more product to Merck.

General and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
$14.8 million in 2003 from $12.5 million in 2002, due
primarily to (i) a $1.0 million increase in payroll
related costs, (ii) a $0.8 million increase in
professional fees, principally associated with legal expenses
for general corporate matters and the collaborations with
Aventis and Novartis, and (iii) a $0.5 million
increase in operating expenses including rent, utilities,
supplies, and insurance.

Other
Income and Expense:

Investment income decreased to $4.5 million
in 2003 from $9.5 million in 2002 due to lower effective
interest rates on investment securities and lower levels of
interest-bearing investments for most of 2003 as we funded our
operations. Average investment balances decreased to
$156.6 million in 2003 from $264.9 million



in 2002. Interest expense was $11.9 million
in both 2003 and 2002. Interest expense is attributable
primarily to $200.0 million of convertible notes issued in
October 2001, which mature in 2008 and bear interest at 5.5% per
annum.

Years Ended December 31, 2002 and

Revenues:

Revenues in the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001 consist of the following:

Our total revenue was $22.0 million in both
2002 and 2001. Contract research and development revenue
decreased to $10.9 million in 2002 from $12.1 million
in 2001 as revenue from Amgen-Regeneron Partners decreased from
$1.2 million in 2001 to approximately $2,000 in 2002, due
to the completion of studies conducted on behalf of the
partnership. Contract manufacturing revenue, related primarily
to our long-term agreement with Merck, increased to
$11.1 million in 2002 from $9.9 million in 2001, due
primarily to the receipt of a non-recurring $1.0 million
payment related to services we provided to Merck in prior years.
We shipped similar quantities of product to Merck in 2002 and
2001. Revenue and the related manufacturing expense are
recognized as product is shipped, after acceptance by Merck.
Included in contract manufacturing revenue in both 2002 and 2001
is $1.8 million of deferred revenue associated with capital
improvement reimbursements paid by Merck prior to commencement
of production. This deferred revenue is being recognized as
product is shipped based on the total amount of product expected
to be shipped over the life of the agreement.

Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses increased to
$125.0 million in 2002 from $92.5 million in 2001, due
primarily to (i) a $14.0 million increase in clinical
expenses associated primarily with our AXOKINE Phase III
clinical trial for the treatment of obesity and our
IL-1 Trap Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, (ii) an $8.7 million increase in
payroll related expenses associated with an increase in
research, clinical, regulatory, and manufacturing personnel,
(iii) a $4.6 million increase in lab supply, outside
testing, and research contract expenses, and (iv) a
$5.2 million increase in facility expenses such as rent,
utilities, insurance, and depreciation.

Contract Manufacturing Expenses:

Contract manufacturing expenses were
$6.5 million in both 2002 and 2001 primarily because we
shipped similar quantities of product to Merck each year.

General and Administrative Expenses:

General and administrative expenses increased to
$12.5 million in 2002 from $9.6 million in 2001, due
primarily to (i) a $1.0 million increase in payroll
related costs, (ii) an $0.8 million increase in patent
prosecution and legal expenses related principally to the
expansion of our intellectual property portfolio, (iii) a
$0.6 million increase in professional fees related to
investor relations services, bank fees, and audit services, and
(iv) a $0.5 million increase in operating expenses
including rent, utilities, supplies, and insurance.



Other Income and Expense:

Investment income decreased to $9.5 million
in 2002 from $13.2 million in 2001, due to lower effective
interest rates on investment securities during the full year
2002. Average investment balances increased to
$264.9 million in 2002 from $155.5 million in 2001.
Interest expense increased to $11.9 million in 2002 from
$2.7 million in 2001, due to interest incurred on the
$200.0 million of convertible notes that we issued in
October 2001, which mature in 2008 and bear interest at 5.5% per
annum.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our
operations primarily through offerings of our equity securities,
a private placement of convertible debt, revenue earned under
our agreements with Novartis, Aventis, Merck, Procter &
Gamble, Serono, Amgen, Sumitomo Chemical Co., and Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals Company, Ltd., and investment income.

Years Ended December 31, 2003 and

Cash Used in Operations:

At December 31, 2003, we had
$366.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities, and restricted marketable securities compared with
$295.2 million at December 31, 2002. Restricted
marketable securities are pledged U.S. government
securities which will be sufficient upon receipt of scheduled
principal and interest payments to provide for the payment in
full of the interest payments on the convertible senior
subordinated notes through 2004. Net cash used in operations was
$6.1 million in 2003 versus $110.5 million in 2002.
The decrease in cash used in operations during 2003 resulted
primarily from the receipt of contract research and development
revenue and non-refundable up-front payments associated with the
Aventis and Novartis collaborations which began in 2003. The
effect of the two agreements on net cash used in operations in
2003 was approximately $134.2 million. The majority of cash
used in operations was to fund research and development,
primarily related to our VEGF Trap and IL-1 Trap
programs.

In September 2003, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement with Aventis to jointly develop and
commercialize the VEGF Trap. Aventis made a non-refundable
up-front payment of $80.0 million which was recorded to
deferred revenue and is being recognized as contract research
and development revenue ratably over the period over which we
are obligated to perform services. In 2003, we recognized
$3.6 million of revenue related to this up-front payment
and we anticipate, based on current VEGF Trap product
development plans, that we will recognize approximately
$10.9 million of revenue over each of the next
7 years. In addition, Aventis has agreed to fund all
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
of the agreement. In 2003, Aventis funded $10.7 million of
our VEGF Trap development costs, of which $8.9 million
was included in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2003.

In March 2003, we entered into a collaboration
agreement with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the
IL-1 Trap. Novartis made a non-refundable up-front payment
of $27.0 million which was recorded to deferred revenue and
is being recognized as contract research and development revenue
ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform
services. In 2003, we recognized $4.9 million of revenue
related to this up-front payment. Development expenses incurred
during 2003 were shared equally by Regeneron and Novartis. In
2003, Novartis agreed to reimburse us for $16.5 million of
our IL-1 Trap development costs, of which $3.2 million was
included in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2003. On
February 27, 2004, we announced that Novartis had provided
notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint
development of the IL-1 Trap. As a result, we will
recognize $22.1 million of revenue in 2004, representing
the balance of deferred revenue at December 31, 2003
related to Novartis’ non-refundable up-front payment.

In 2003, we recorded a non-cash expense of
$1.5 million associated with the issuance of our Common
Stock in connection with a license agreement entered into with
Merck.

In both 2003 and 2002, we made two semi-annual
interest payments totaling $11.0 million per year on our
convertible senior subordinated notes.



Cash Used in Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities was
$63.8 million in 2003 compared to $58.5 million in
2002. The increase is due primarily to purchases of marketable
securities which exceeded sales and/or maturities of marketable
securities by $10.0 million. Offsetting this increase was a
$4.7 million decrease in cash payments made for capital
expenditures due to the completion of the Rensselaer plant
expansion in 2003.

Cash Provided by Financing
    Activities:

Cash provided by financing activities increased
to $108.2 million in 2003 compared to $1.7 million in
2002, due primarily to the sale of stock to Aventis and Novartis
in 2003 in association with the collaboration agreements.
Aventis purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of
our Common Stock for $45.0 million. Novartis purchased
7,527,050 newly issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock
for $48.0 million. In addition, in accordance with our
collaboration agreement with Novartis, we elected to fund our
share of 2003 IL-1 Trap development expenses through a loan
from Novartis that will be forgiven, together with accrued
interest, should certain preclinical and clinical milestones be
reached. If these milestones are not reached, the loan is due
and payable on July 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2003,
we have drawn $13.7 million, excluding interest, against
this loan facility and we have drawn an additional
$3.8 million during the first quarter of 2004 for expenses
incurred during 2003.

Aventis Agreement:

Under the collaboration agreement with Aventis,
we and Aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on
sales, if any, of the VEGF Trap. Aventis has agreed to make
a $25.0 million payment to us upon achievement of an
early-stage clinical milestone. We may also receive up to
$360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight
VEGF Trap indications in Europe or the United States.

We have agreed to continue to manufacture
clinical supplies of the VEGF Trap at our plant in
Rensselaer, New York. Aventis has agreed to be responsible for
providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the
VEGF Trap. Under the collaboration agreement, agreed upon
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
of the agreement, including costs associated with the
manufacture of clinical drug supply, will be funded by Aventis.
If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will reimburse
Aventis for 50 percent of the VEGF Trap development
expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of
development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits,
or at a faster rate at our option. We have the option to conduct
additional pre-Phase III studies at our own expense. In
2003, we incurred and were reimbursed by Aventis for
$10.7 million in development expenses related to the
VEGF Trap program. In addition to expenses incurred by us
in 2003, Aventis incurred $0.1 million in development
expenses related to the VEGF Trap program.

In 2004, we and Aventis plan to invest
approximately $100 million to support the development of
the VEGF Trap. The broad based development program will
include multiple Phase I studies to evaluate the
VEGF Trap in combination with other therapies in various
cancer indications, Phase II single-agent studies of the
VEGF Trap in separate cancer indications, and multiple
Phase I studies of the VEGF Trap in certain eye
diseases.

Novartis Agreement:

Pursuant to the terms of our collaboration
agreement with Novartis, in 2004, Novartis will be responsible
for agreed upon pre-Phase III development expenses through
the expiration of the nine-month termination notice period,
which ends at the end of November 2004. In addition, a loan
totaling $17.5 million as of March 3, 2004 that
relates to our share of 2003 development expense will be
forgiven, together with accrued interest, should we meet certain
milestones. Otherwise, the loan is due and payable on
July 1, 2004.



Under the Novartis agreement, Novartis and we
retain rights under the collaboration agreement to elect to
collaborate on the development and commercialization of other
IL-1 antagonists being developed independently by the other
party that are in earlier stages of development than the
IL-1 Trap.

Merck License Agreement:

In August 2003, Merck granted to us a
non-exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications
which may be used in the development and commercialization of
AXOKINE. As consideration, we issued to Merck 109,450 newly
issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock (the Merck
Shares), valued at $1.5 million based on the fair market
value of shares of our Common Stock on the agreement’s
effective date. The agreement requires us to make an additional
payment to Merck upon receipt of marketing approval for a
product covered by the licensed patents. In addition, we would
be required to pay royalties, at staggered rates in the
mid-single digits, based on the net sales of products covered by
the licensed patents.

At any time prior to the date that Merck has the
right to sell the Merck Shares under the Securities Act of 1933
(the Sales Date), we have the right to buy back the Merck Shares
from Merck for a purchase price equal to the greater of
(a) $1.5 million and (b) the lesser of
(i) the fair market value of the shares and
(ii) $1.65 million. Unless Regeneron has previously
exercised its right to buy back the Merck Shares, on the Sales
Date if the fair market value of the Merck Shares (the Market
Price) is less than $1.5 million, we will be required to
make a cash payment to Merck equal to the difference between the
Market Price and $1.5 million. Conversely, if on the Sales
Date the Market Price is greater than $1.65 million, Merck
will be required, at its option, to either (i) make a cash
payment to us equal to the difference between the Market Price
and $1.65 million (the Excess Amount) or (ii) return a
number of the Merck Shares to us, calculated by dividing the
Excess Amount by the fair market value of a share of our Common
Stock on the Sales Date. The fair market value of the shares,
based on our closing Common Stock price at December 31,
2003, was $1.6 million.

Convertible Debt:

In 2001, we issued $200.0 million aggregate
principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a
private placement and received proceeds, after deducting the
initial purchasers’ discount and out-of pocket expenses, of
$192.7 million. The notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum,
payable semi-annually and mature in 2008. The notes are
convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion
price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to adjustment
in certain circumstances. We may redeem the notes, in whole or
in part, at any time before October 17, 2004, if the
closing price of our Common Stock has exceeded 150% of the
conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time.
Upon any such redemption, we are required to pay interest that
would have been due up through October 17, 2004. We may
also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after
October 17, 2004, if the closing price of our Common Stock
has exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in effect for a
specified period of time.

As part of this transaction, we pledged
$31.6 million of U.S. government securities which will
be sufficient upon receipt of scheduled principal and interest
payments to provide for the payment in full of the first six
scheduled interest payments on the notes when due.

Capital Expenditures:

Our additions to property, plant, and equipment
totaled $16.9 million in 2003, $45.9 million in 2002,
and $9.5 million in 2001, including a total over the three
years of $50.2 million related to the expansion of our
manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York. In 2004, we
expect to incur approximately $10 million to
$15 million in capital expenditures which primarily
consists of equipment for our expanded manufacturing, research,
and development activities, a portion of which will be
reimbursed by Aventis.

Funding Requirements:

Our total expenses for research and development
from inception through December 31, 2003 have been
approximately $721 million. We have not historically
segregated all the costs associated with each of our



research programs and it is not possible to
forecast their success or the amounts that we may spend in the
future. We currently have research and development collaboration
agreements with Aventis, Novartis, Procter & Gamble,
Medarex, Emisphere, Amgen, and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals. In
2003, 2002, and 2001, total expenses for research programs
conducted under our third-party collaboration agreements were
approximately $46 million, $10 million, and
$12 million, respectively. The remainder of our research
and development expenses in those years related to our own
internal research programs.

We expect to continue to incur substantial
funding requirements primarily for research and development
activities (including preclinical and clinical testing). We
currently anticipate that in 2004 approximately 50-70% of our
expenditures will be directed toward the preclinical and
clinical development of product candidates, including the
VEGF Trap, IL-1 Trap, IL-4/ 13 Trap, and AXOKINE;
approximately 10-20% of our expenditures will cover our basic
research activities and the continued development of our novel
technology platforms; and the remainder of our expenditures will
be for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes,
including working capital.

In connection with our funding requirements, the
following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2003 for leases and long-term debt. None of
these obligations extend beyond 5 years.

(1)

Includes amounts representing interest.

(2)

Excludes future contingent rental costs for
    utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. In 2003,
    these costs were $6.0 million.

(3)

Includes long-term portion of restricted cash
    awards granted in December 2003 which vest semi-annually over an
    approximate two year period.

In January 2004, the Company amended its
Tarrytown lease and exercised its option to extend the lease for
certain parts of the leased space through December 2009. The
amended lease contains renewal options for certain parts of the
leased space through December 2014.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend
on various factors, including the status of competitive
products, the success of our research and development programs,
the potential future need to expand our professional and support
staff and facilities, the status of patents and other
intellectual property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical
trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the
continuation, extent, and success of any collaborative research
and development collaborations (including those with Aventis,
Procter & Gamble, Medarex, and Emisphere). Clinical trial
costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and
duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by
clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs
for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials,
supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of
funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends
upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and
early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the
clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we
decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost
of each trial as described above. In the future, if we are able
to successfully develop, market, and sell certain of our product
candidates, we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise
share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our
collaboration and licensing agreements.

We expect that expenses related to the filing,
prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patent and other
intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as
a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the United States
and foreign countries.



We believe that our existing capital resources
will enable us to meet operating needs through at least the end
of 2005. However, this is a forward-looking statement based on
our current operating plan, and there may be a change in
projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital
being consumed significantly before such time. If there is
insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and
activities, we believe we would prioritize available capital to
fund preclinical and clinical development of our product
candidates. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements and do not
guarantee the obligations of any other entity. As of
December 31, 2003, we had no established banking
arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing
or a line of credit. In the event we need additional financing
for the operation of our business, we will consider
collaborative arrangements and additional public or private
financing, including additional equity financing. Factors
influencing the availability of additional financing include our
progress in product development, investor perception of our
prospects, and the general condition of the financial markets.
We may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new
collaborative arrangements or additional public or private
offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our
capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or
eliminate certain of our research and development activities or
future operations. This could harm our business.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenue from contract research and
development and research progress payments in accordance with
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104) and Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

(EITF 00-21). During the third quarter of
2003, we elected to change the method we use to recognize
revenue under SAB 104 related to non-refundable
collaborator payments, including up-front licensing payments,
payments for development activities, and research progress
(milestone) payments, to the Substantive Milestone Method,
adopted retroactively to January 1, 2003. Under this
method, we recognize revenue from non-refundable up-front
license payments, not tied to achieving a specific performance
milestone, ratably over the period over which we are obligated
to perform services. The period over which we are obligated to
perform services is estimated based on product development
plans. These estimates are likely to change based on the results
and progress of clinical trials and drug production. Changes in
these estimates could result in a significant change to the
amount of revenue recognized in future periods. In addition, if
a collaborator terminates the agreement in accordance with the
terms of the contract, we would recognize the remainder of the
up-front payment at the time of the termination. Payments for
development activities are recognized as revenue as earned,
ratably over the period of effort. Substantive at-risk milestone
payments, which are based on achieving a specific performance
milestone, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is
achieved and the related payment is due, provided there is no
future service obligation associated with that milestone.
Previously, we had recognized revenue from non-refundable
collaborator payments based on the percentage of costs incurred
to date, estimated costs to complete, and total expected
contract revenue. However, the revenue recognized was limited to
the amount of non-refundable payments received. The change in
accounting method was made because we believe that it better
reflects the substance of our collaborative agreements and is
more consistent with current practices in the biotechnology
industry.

Recognition of Deferred Revenue Related to
    Contract Manufacturing Agreement:

We have entered into a contract manufacturing
agreement with Merck under which we manufacture a vaccine
intermediate at our Rensselaer, New York facility and perform
services. We recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this
agreement after the product is tested and approved by, and
shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck, and as services are
performed. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to modify
portions of our Rensselaer facility to manufacture Merck’s
vaccine intermediate and Merck agreed to reimburse us for the
related capital costs. These capital cost payments were deferred
and are recognized as revenue as product is shipped to Merck,
based upon our estimate of Merck’s order quantities each
year through the expected end of the agreement. Since we
commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in



November 1999, our estimates of Merck’s
order quantities each year have not been materially different
from Merck’s actual orders.

Clinical Trial Accrual Estimates:

For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain
clinical trial costs, which are included in research and
development expenses, are expensed based on the expected total
number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients
enter the trial, and the period over which clinical
investigators or contract research organizations are expected to
provide services. We believe that this method best aligns the
expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical
trial. During the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of
clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our
estimates.

Depreciation of Property, Plant and
    Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the
useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred.
The cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets
retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and
any gain or loss is recognized in operations. The estimated
useful lives of property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

6-30 years

Leasehold improvements

Life of lease

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

In some situations, the life of the asset may be
extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us
to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed. The
life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension
of lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in the lives of
assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of
depreciation recognized in future periods. Costs of construction
of certain long-lived assets include capitalized interest which
is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

In December 2003, the Staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued SAB 104,

Revenue
Recognition,

which supercedes SAB 101,

Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements

. SAB 104’s
primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in
SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements,
superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the
SEC’s

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

(the FAQ) issued with
SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13,

Revenue Recognition

. Selected portions of the FAQ have
been incorporated into SAB 104. While the wording of
SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of
EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of
SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of
SAB 104. Adoption of SAB 104 was required immediately
and did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

(FIN 46R), which was issued in January 2003. FIN 46R
clarifies the application of ARB No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

, to certain entities in
which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity
at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46R requires
the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest
entities (VIEs), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The
primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that will absorb a
majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive a
majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or
both. Among other changes, the revisions of FIN 46R
(i) clarified some requirements of the original
FIN 46, which had been issued in January 2003,
(ii) eased some implementation problems, and
(iii) added new scope exceptions. FIN 46R deferred the



effective date of the Interpretation for public
companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after
March 15, 2004, except that all public companies must at a
minimum apply the provisions of the Interpretation to entities
that were previously considered “special-purpose
entities” under the FASB literature prior to the issuance
of FIN 46R by the end of the first reporting period ending
after December 15, 2003. Adoption of FIN 46R did not
have a material impact on our financial statements.

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement No. 150 (SFAS No. 150),

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

.
SFAS No. 150 specifies that instruments within its
scope embody obligations of the issuer and that the issuer must
classify them as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 requires
issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of
freestanding financial instruments: (i) mandatorily
redeemable financial instruments, (i) obligations to
repurchase the issuer’s equity shares by transferring
assets, and (iii) certain obligations to issue a variable number
of shares. SFAS No. 150 defines a “freestanding
financial instrument” as a financial instrument that
(i) is entered into separately and apart from any of the
entity’s other financial instruments or equity transactions
or (ii) is entered into in conjunction with some other
transaction and can be legally detached and exercised on a
separate basis. For all financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, SFAS No. 150 is
effective immediately. For all other instruments of public
companies, SFAS No. 150 went into effect at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did
not have a material impact on our financial statements. In
November 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board deferred
the effective date for selected provisions of
SFAS No. 150, limited to mandatorily redeemable
noncontrolling interests associated with finite-lived
subsidiaries. The deferral of those selected provisions is not
expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45 (FIN 45),

Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34

. FIN 45 elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual
financial statements about its obligations under guarantees
issued. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required
to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition
and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and
did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Risk Factors

Regeneron operates in an environment that
involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties. We
caution you to read the following risk factors, which have
affected, and/or in the future could affect, our business,
operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. The
risks described below include forward-looking statements, and
our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed
in these forward-looking statements. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties are included
under other captions in this report and should be considered by
our investors.

Risks Related to our Financial Results and
Need for Additional Financing

We have had a history of operating losses
    and we may never achieve profitability. Moreover, if we continue
    to incur operating losses, we may be unable to continue our
    operations.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through
December 31, 2003, we had a cumulative loss of
$531.5 million. If we continue to incur operating losses
and fail to become a profitable company, we may be unable to
continue our operations. We have no products that are available
for sale and do not know when we will have products available
for sale, if ever. In the absence of revenue from the sale of
products or other sources, the amount, timing, nature, or source
of which cannot be predicted, our losses will continue as we
conduct our research and development activities. The extent and
timing of our future losses and our profitability, if we are
ever to become profitable, are highly uncertain.



We will need additional funding in the
    future, which may not be available to us, and which would then
    force us to delay, reduce, or eliminate our product development
    programs or commercialization efforts.

We will need to expend substantial resources for
research and development, including costs associated with
clinical testing of our product candidates. We believe our
existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating
needs through at least the end of 2005. However, this is a
forward-looking statement based on our current operating plan
and we cannot assure you that there will be no change in
projected revenue or expenses that would lead to our capital
being consumed significantly before such time. We will likely
require additional financing in the future and we cannot make
assurances that we will be able to raise such additional funds.
The sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future
may be dilutive to our shareholders. Debt financing arrangements
may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants
that would restrict certain business activities or our ability
to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that
are not favorable to our shareholders. We may be unable to raise
sufficient funds to complete the development of our product
candidates or to continue operations. As a result, we may face
delay, reduction, or elimination of our research and development
programs or preclinical or clinical trials, in which case our
business, financial condition, or results of operations may be
materially harmed.

We have a significant amount of debt and
    may have insufficient cash to satisfy our debt service and
    repayment obligations. In addition, the amount of our debt could
    impede our operations and flexibility.

We have a significant amount of convertible debt
and semi-annual interest payment obligations. The debt, unless
converted to shares of our common stock, will mature in October
2008. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or
otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on
our debt. Even if we are able to meet our debt service
obligations, the amount of debt we already have could hurt our
ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for
working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, or other purposes. In addition, our debt
obligations could require us to use a substantial portion of
cash to pay principal and interest on our debt, instead of
applying those funds to other purposes, such as research and
development, working capital, and capital expenditures.

Risks Related to Development of our Product
Candidates

Successful development of any of our
    product candidates is highly uncertain.

Only a small minority of all research and
development programs ultimately result in commercially
successful drugs. We have never developed a drug that has been
approved for marketing and sale and we may never succeed in
developing an approved drug. Even if clinical trials demonstrate
safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a
specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are
obtained, the commercial success of any of our product
candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients, the
medical community, and third-party payors and on our and our
partners’ ability to successfully manufacture and
commercialize our product candidate. Our product candidates are
delivered either by intravenous or subcutaneous injections,
which are generally less well received by patients than tablet
or capsule delivery. If our products are not successfully
commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant
investment we have made in developing such products and our
business would be severely harmed.

Clinical trials required for our product
    candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome
    is highly uncertain. If any of our drug trials are delayed or
    achieve unfavorable results, we will have to delay or may be
    unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product
    candidates.

We must conduct extensive testing of our product
candidates before we can obtain regulatory approval to market
and sell them. We need to conduct both preclinical animal
testing and human clinical trials. Conducting these trials is a
lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. These tests and
trials may not achieve favorable results for many causes,
including, among others, failure of the product candidate to
demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious or
life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or
connected with exposure to the product candidate, difficulty in
enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial, lack
of sufficient supplies of the product candidate, and the failure
of clinical investigators, trial monitors and other



consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the
trial plan or protocol. A clinical trial may also fail because
it did not include a sufficient number of patients to detect the
endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance. For
example, the pending trials studying the maintenance of weight
loss following short-term treatment regimens with AXOKINE may
not have enrolled enough patients to detect statistically
significant differences between patients treated with AXOKINE
and those taking placebo. These trials were designed before we
had access to the data from the completed pivotal Phase III
AXOKINE trial, which demonstrated that the magnitude of the
average difference in weight loss observed between all
AXOKINE-treated subjects and those taking placebo was small.

We would need to reevaluate any drug candidate
that did not test favorably and either conduct new trials, which
would be expensive and time consuming, or abandon the drug
development program. Even if we obtain positive results from
preclinical or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same
success in future trials. Many companies in the
biopharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered
significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising
results have been obtained in earlier trials. The failure of
clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for our
desired indications could harm the development of the product
candidate, and our business, financial condition, and results of
operations may be materially harmed.

The development of serious or
    life-threatening side effects with any of our product candidates
    would lead to delay or discontinuation of development, which
    could severely harm our business.

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients
report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries,
and discomforts to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible
to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied
caused these conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and
discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during clinical
trials of our product candidates. Although our current drug
candidates appeared to be generally well tolerated in clinical
trials, it is possible as we test any of them in larger, longer,
and more extensive clinical programs, illnesses, injuries, and
discomforts that were observed in earlier trials, as well as
conditions that did not occur or went undetected in smaller
previous trials, will be reported by patients. If additional
clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates
has many side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side
effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be
delayed, which would severely harm our business.

Our VEGF Trap is being studied for the potential
treatment of certain types of cancer and diseases of the eye.
There are many potential safety concerns associated with
significant blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor, or
VEGF. These safety concerns may limit our ability to
successfully develop the VEGF Trap.

Genentech and Eyetech are developing VEGF
inhibiting molecules for certain diseases of the eye that will
be delivered by direct administration to the eye. We are
studying the VEGF Trap for the potential treatment of certain
diseases of the eye through intravitreal injections in the eye
or general administration through intravenous infusions or
subcutaneous injections. Although we believe that there are
potential clinical advantages to general administration over
injections directly in the eye (including patient comfort and
acceptance), there are unique potential risks to patients
associated with systemic blockage of VEGF by intravenous
infusions or subcutaneous injections that could limit or end the
VEGF Trap development program. These risks, based on the
clinical and pre-clinical experience of systemically delivered
VEGF inhibitors, include bleeding, hypertension, and
proteinuria. In addition, patients given infusions of any
protein, including the VEGF Trap, may develop severe
hypersensitivity reactions, referred to as infusion reactions.
There may be additional complications or side effects that could
harm the development of the VEGF Trap for either the treatment
of cancer or diseases of the eye.

Our product candidates in development are
    recombinant proteins that could cause an immune response,
    resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies
    against the therapeutic protein.

In addition to the safety, efficacy,
manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our product
candidates, the administration of recombinant proteins
frequently causes an immune response, resulting in the creation
of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. The antibodies
can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness
of the protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain a
therapeutic effect. In some cases,



the antibody can cross react with the
patient’s own proteins, resulting in an
“auto-immune” type disease. Whether antibodies will be
created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical
experiments, and their appearance is often delayed, so that
there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not
be created at a later date — in some cases even after
pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Approximately
two-thirds of the subjects who received AXOKINE in the completed
Phase III study developed neutralizing antibodies. In addition,
subjects who received the IL-1 Trap in clinical trials have
developed antibodies. It is possible that as we test the
VEGF Trap in different patient populations and larger
clinical trials, subjects given the VEGF Trap will develop
antibodies to the product candidate.

A previous Phase III study evaluating
    AXOKINE demonstrated modest average weight loss over a 12-month
    period. In addition, a completed Phase II study evaluating
    the IL-1 Trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis failed
    to achieve its primary endpoint.

In March 2003, we reported data from the 12-month
treatment period of our initial Phase III pivotal trial of
AXOKINE. Although the Phase III study met its primary
endpoints and many individuals achieved a medically meaningful
weight loss, the average weight loss was small and limited by
the development of antibodies.

In October 2003, we reported results from the
first Phase II trial of our IL-1 Trap. While patients
treated with the highest dose, 100 milligrams of the
IL-1 Trap, exhibited improvements in the primary endpoint
of the trial, the proportion of ACR 20 responses versus
placebo, the results did not achieve statistical significance.
We plan to conduct a Phase IIb study of the IL-1 Trap
in a larger patient population, testing higher doses than were
tested in the previous Phase II trial and for a longer
period of time. However, there is no assurance that higher doses
will lead to better results than were demonstrated in the
previous Phase II trial. In addition, safety or
tolerability concerns may arise which limit our ability to
deliver higher doses of the IL-1 Trap to patients. We plan
to study higher doses of the IL-1 Trap through increased
subcutaneous injections and intravenous delivery. Either
approach may affect the safety and/or tolerability of the
IL-1 Trap, which may limit its commercial potential if the
product candidate is ever approved for marketing and sale.

Regulatory and Litigation Risks

If we do not obtain regulatory approval for
    our product candidates, we will not be able to market or sell
    them.

We cannot sell or market products without
regulatory approval. If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory
approval for our product candidates, the value of our company
and our results of operations will be harmed. In the United
States, we must obtain and maintain approval from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for each drug we
intend to sell. Obtaining FDA approval is typically a lengthy
and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain. Foreign
governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and
approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive
process, and approval is highly uncertain. None of our product
candidates has ever received regulatory approval to be marketed
and sold in the United States or any other country. We may never
receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

If the testing or use of our products harms
    people, we could be subject to costly and damaging product
    liability claims. We could also face costly and damaging claims
    arising from employment law, securities law, environmental law,
    or other applicable laws governing our operations.

The testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale
of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk.
We are currently involved in a product liability lawsuit brought
by a subject who participated in a clinical trial of one of our
drug candidates. Any informed consent or waivers obtained from
people who sign up for our clinical trials may not protect us
from liability or the cost of litigation. Our product liability
insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not
completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation.
Moreover, we may not have access to liability insurance or be
able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms.



In May 2003, securities class action lawsuits
were commenced against Regeneron and certain of its officers and
directors in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. A consolidated amended class action
complaint was filed in October 2003. The complaint, which
purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of
investors in the Company’s publicly traded securities
between March 28, 2000 and March 30, 2003, alleges
that the defendants misstated or omitted material information
concerning the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE, in violation of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Damages are
sought in an unspecified amount. No reserve for damages has been
established because we do not believe that a loss is probable.
However, if the outcome of the litigation is adverse to us, we
could be subject to significant liability, which could exceed
our insurance coverage.

Our operations may involve hazardous
    materials and are subject to environmental, health, and safety
    laws and regulations. We may incur substantial liability arising
    from our activities involving the use of hazardous
    materials.

As a biopharmaceutical company with significant
manufacturing operations, we are subject to extensive
environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,
including those governing the use of hazardous materials. Our
research and development and manufacturing activities involve
the controlled use of chemicals, viruses, radioactive compounds,
and other hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with
environmental, health, and safety regulations is substantial. If
an accident involving these materials or an environmental
discharge were to occur, we could be held liable for any
resulting damages, or face regulatory actions, which could
exceed our resources or insurance coverage.

Risks Related to our Dependence on Third
Parties

On February 27, 2004, Novartis
    provided notice to us that they would not participate in the
    continued development and commercialization of the
    IL-1 Trap under our collaboration agreement. This may harm
    our ability to develop and commercialize the
    IL-1 Trap.

We relied heavily on Novartis to provide their
expertise, resources, funding, manufacturing capacity, clinical
expertise, and commercial infrastructure to support the
IL-1 Trap program. Novartis’ decision to withdraw from
participating in the development and commercialization of the
IL-1 Trap may delay or disrupt the IL-1 Trap program.
We do not have the resources and skills to replace those of
Novartis to help the development and potential commercialization
of the IL-1 Trap. In addition, we will have to fund the
development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap without
Novartis’ long-term commitment, which will require
substantially greater expenditures on our part. While the
agreement requires Novartis to continue to fund agreed
pre-Phase III development expenses for the nine-month
period following its termination decision and imposes additional
post-termination obligations on the parties, Novartis may not
fulfill all payment and other obligations we believe are
required of it under the agreement, which may cause us to incur
further costs and risk delays and disruptions to the
IL-1 Trap program.

If our collaboration with Aventis for the
    VEGF Trap is terminated, our ability to develop and
    commercialize the VEGF Trap in the time expected, or at all, and
    our business operations would be harmed.

We rely heavily on Aventis to assist with the
development of the VEGF Trap. If the VEGF Trap program
continues, we will rely on Aventis to assist with providing
commercial manufacturing capacity, enrolling and monitoring
clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, particularly
outside the United States, and providing sales and marketing
support. While we cannot assure you that the VEGF Trap will
ever be successfully developed and commercialized, if Aventis
does not perform its obligations in a timely manner, or at all,
our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the
VEGF Trap will be significantly adversely affected. Aventis
has the right to terminate rights to our product candidates
under its collaboration agreement with us at



any time. If Aventis were to terminate its
collaboration agreement with us, we might not have the resources
or skills to replace those of our partner, which could cause
significant delays in the development and/or manufacture of the
VEGF Trap and result in substantial additional costs to us.
We have no sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities.
Termination of the Aventis collaboration agreement would create
new and additional risks to the successful development of the
VEGF Trap.

Sanofi-Synthelabo has initiated a tender offer in
an attempt to acquire Aventis. It is unclear what the impact of
this or any other business combination involving Aventis would
have on the VEGF Trap collaboration, including the possibility
of a termination of the collaboration agreement and a delay in,
or disruption to, the VEGF Trap development program.

Our collaborators and service providers may
    fail to perform adequately in their efforts to support the
    development, manufacture, and commercialization of our drug
    candidates.

We depend upon third-party collaborators,
including Aventis and service providers such as clinical
research organizations, outside testing laboratories, clinical
investigator sites, and third party manufacturers and product
packagers and labelers, to assist us in the development of our
product candidates. If any of our existing collaborators or
service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us
or does not perform its development or manufacturing services
under an agreement in a timely manner or at all, we would
experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the
development or ultimate commercialization of our product
candidates.

Risks Related to the Manufacture of our
Product Candidates

We have limited manufacturing capacity,
    which could inhibit our ability to successfully develop or
    commercialize our drugs.

Before approving a new drug or biologic product,
the FDA requires that the facilities at which the product will
be manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing
practices, or cGMP requirements. Manufacturing product
candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is
complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To be successful, our
products must be manufactured for development and, following
approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with
regulatory requirements and at competitive costs. If we or any
of our product collaborators or third-party manufacturers,
fillers, or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory
compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions, including,
among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for
a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing
approval. As a result, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations may be materially harmed.

While we believe our current manufacturing
facility is adequate for the current production of quantities of
active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, for our product
candidates for clinical trials, our manufacturing facility is
likely to be inadequate to produce sufficient quantities of
product for commercial sale. We intend to rely on our corporate
collaborators, as well as contract manufacturers, to produce
large quantities of drug material needed for commercialization
of our products. We rely entirely on third party manufacturers
for filling and finishing services. We will have to depend on
these manufacturers to deliver material on a timely basis and to
comply with regulatory requirements. If we are unable to supply
sufficient material on acceptable terms, or if we should
encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our
corporate collaborators or contract manufacturers, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations may be materially
harmed.

We may expand our own manufacturing capacity to
support commercial production of API for our product candidates.
This will require substantial additional funds, and we would
need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and
managerial personnel to staff our facility. Start-up costs can
be large and scale-up entails significant risks related to
process development and manufacturing yields. We may be unable
to develop manufacturing facilities that are sufficient to
produce drug material for clinical trials or commercial use. In
addition, we may be unable to secure adequate filling and
finishing services to support our products. As a result, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations may be
materially harmed.

We may be unable to obtain key raw materials and
supplies for the manufacture of our product candidates. In
addition, we may face difficulties in developing or acquiring
production technology and managerial personnel to manufacture
sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable
costs and in



compliance with applicable quality assurance and
environmental regulations and governmental permitting
requirements.

If any of our clinical programs are
    discontinued, we may face costs related to the underutilization
    of our manufacturing facilities.

We maintain an 8,000 square foot
manufacturing facility in Tarrytown, New York and have
large-scale manufacturing operations in Rensselaer, New York.
Under a long-term manufacturing agreement with Merck, we produce
an intermediate for a Merck pediatric vaccine at our facility in
Rensselaer, New York. We also use our facilities to produce API
for our own clinical and preclinical candidates. If we no longer
use our facilities to manufacture the Merck intermediate or
clinical candidates are discontinued, we would have to absorb
overhead costs and inefficiencies.

Risks Related to Commercialization of
Products

If we are unable to establish sales,
    marketing, and distribution capabilities, or enter into
    agreements with third parties to do so, we will be unable to
    successfully market and sell future drug products.

We have no sales or distribution personnel or
capabilities and have only a small staff with marketing
capabilities. If we are unable to obtain those capabilities,
either by developing our own organizations or entering into
agreements with service providers, we will not be able to
successfully sell our products. In that event, we will not be
able to generate significant revenue, even if our product
candidates are approved. We cannot guarantee that we will be
able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we
need. We may not be able to enter into marketing, or
distribution agreements with third-party providers on acceptable
terms, if at all. Currently, we are relying on Aventis for
sales, marketing, and distribution of the VEGF Trap. We will
have to rely on a third party or devote significant resources to
develop our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities
for our other product candidates. We may be unsuccessful in
developing our own sales, marketing, and distribution
organization.

We may be unable to formulate or
    manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for
    clinical or commercial use.

Changes in product formulations and manufacturing
processes may be required as product candidates progress in
clinical development and are ultimately commercialized. If we
are unable to develop suitable product formulations or
manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing
of our product candidates, including VEGF Trap,
IL-1 Trap, IL-4/13 Trap and AXOKINE, we may be unable
to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials, which
would delay the development of our product candidates.
Similarly, if we are unable to supply sufficient quantities of
product or develop product formulations suitable for commercial
use, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our
product candidates. For example, AXOKINE is currently formulated
for delivery in single use vials. We are in the process of
developing a formulation that may be used in multiple use vials.
If we are unable to develop this multiple use vial formulation,
potential future AXOKINE sales and profitability may be limited.
Another example is our IL-1 Trap. We are in the process of
developing formulations that would allow delivery of higher
doses of the IL-1 Trap to test in clinical trials. This
includes formulations for subcutaneous and intravenous
administration. If we are unable to develop or manufacture such
a higher dose formulation that can be produced in a
cost-effective manner, potential future IL-1 Trap sales and
profitability may be limited.

Even if our product candidates are ever
    approved, their commercial success is highly uncertain because
    our competitors may get to the marketplace before we do with
    better or lower cost drugs.

There is substantial competition in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and chemical companies. Many of our competitors
have substantially greater research, preclinical, and clinical
product development and manufacturing capabilities, and
financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. Our
smaller competitors may also be significant if they acquire or
discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements,
or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even



if we achieve product commercialization, our
competitors have achieved, and may continue to achieve, product
commercialization before our products are approved for marketing
and sale. Genentech has an approved VEGF antagonist on the
market and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies are working to develop competing VEGF antagonists,
including Novartis and Pfizer. Many of these molecules are
farther along in development than the VEGF Trap and may offer
competitive advantages over our molecule. The marketing approval
for Genentech’s VEGF antagonist, Avastin™, may make it
more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to
support the VEGF Trap. The markets for both rheumatoid arthritis
and asthma are both very competitive. Several highly successful
medicines are available for these diseases. Examples include the
TNF-antagonists Enbrel® (a registered trademark of Amgen),
Remicade® (a registered trademark of Centocor), and
Humira® (a registered trademark of Abbott) for rheumatoid
arthritis, and the leukotriene-modifier Singulair® (a
registered trademark of Merck), as well as various inexpensive
corticosteroid medicines for asthma. The availability of highly
effective FDA approved TNF-antagonists makes it more difficult
to successfully develop the IL-1 Trap for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis. It will be difficult to enroll patients
with rheumatoid arthritis to participate in clinical trials of
the IL-1 Trap, which may delay or impair our ability to
successfully develop the drug candidate. In addition, even if
the IL-1 Trap is ever approved for sale, it will be
difficult for our drug to compete against these FDA approved
TNF-antagonists because doctors and patients will have
significant experience using these effective medicines. There is
also substantial competition in the discovery and development of
treatments for obesity, as well as established, cost-effective,
and emerging surgical, prescription, and over-the-counter
treatments for the disease that may offer competitive advantages
over AXOKINE. AXOKINE is available only in injectible form,
while the currently available marketed medicines for the
treatment of obesity, and a late-stage product candidate in
development by Sanofi-Synthelabo, are delivered in pill form,
which is generally favored over injectible medicines. Therefore,
even if AXOKINE is approved for sale, the fact that it must be
delivered by injection may severely limit its market acceptance
among patients and physicians.

The successful commercialization of our
    product candidates will depend on obtaining coverage and
    reimbursement for use of these products from third-party
    payors.

Sales of biopharmaceutical products largely
depend on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses
by government health care programs and private health insurers.
Without the financial support of the governments or third-party
payors, the market for any biopharmaceutical product will be
limited. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging
the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of products and
services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement
status of any new therapeutic, particularly if there exist
lower-cost standards of care. Third-party payors may not
reimburse sales of our products, which would harm our business.

Risks Related to Employees

We are dependent on our key personnel and
    if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research,
    development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our
    business will be harmed.

We are highly dependent on our executive
officers. If we are not able to retain any of these persons or
our Chairman, our business may suffer. In particular, we depend
on the services of Roy Vagelos, M.D., the Chairman of our Board
of Directors, Leonard Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., our President
and Chief Executive Officer, and George D.
Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice President,
Chief Scientific Officer and President, Regeneron Research
Laboratories. There is intense competition in the biotechnology
industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in
the development, manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. We
may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified
personnel necessary for developing our business.



Risks Related to Intellectual
Property

If we cannot protect the confidentiality of
    our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our
    proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will
    be harmed.

Our business requires using sensitive and
proprietary technology and other information that we protect as
trade secrets. We seek to prevent improper disclosure of these
trade secrets through confidentiality agreements. If our trade
secrets are improperly exposed, either by our own employees or
our collaborators, it would help our competitors and adversely
affect our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary
rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent
that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or
are effectively maintained as trade secrets. The patent position
of biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual
questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted
with certainty. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated, or
circumvented. One way a patent application may be challenged
outside the United States is for a party to file an opposition.
These opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the
European Union and are costly to defend. We have patent
applications that are being opposed and it is likely that we
will defend additional patent applications in the future as
third parties oppose them. Also, our patent rights may not
provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages
against competitors. The enforcement of our intellectual
property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the
outcome is favorable to us.

We may be restricted in our development
    and/or commercialization activities by third party
    patents.

Our commercial success depends significantly on
our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other
proprietary rights of third parties. Other parties could allege
to have blocking patents to our Trap products in clinical
development, either because of a proprietary position on fusion
proteins or a proprietary position covering components of the
Trap or the way it is manufactured. We are aware of certain
United States and foreign patents relating to particular IL-4
and IL-13 receptors. Our IL-4/13 Trap includes portions of
the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. In addition, we are aware of a
broad patent held by Genentech relating to proteins fused to
certain immunoglobulin domains. Our Trap product candidates
include proteins fused to immunoglobulin domains. With regard to
these patents, we have determined that in our judgment that
either our products do not infringe the patents, we do not
believe the patents are valid, or we have identified and are
testing or developing various modifications that we believe
should not infringe the patents.

Any patent holders could sue us for damages and
seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or developing
our drug candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing
validly issued patents of third parties. In the event that the
manufacture, use, or sale of any of our clinical candidates
infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of
third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product
development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our drugs
and may be required to pay costly damages. Such a result may
materially harm our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. Legal disputes are likely to be costly and time
consuming to defend.

We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in
our judgment, such licenses are needed. If any licenses are
required, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain
any such license could prevent us from developing or
commercializing any one or more of our product candidates, which
could severely harm our business.

Risks Related to our Common Stock

Our stock
price may be extremely volatile.

There has been significant volatility in our
stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology
companies’ securities. Various factors and events may have
a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
These factors include, by way of example:

•

progress, delays, or adverse results in clinical
    trials;

•

announcement of technological innovations or
    product candidates by us or competitors;



The trading price of our common stock has been,
and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in
response to these and other factors, including the sale or
attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock in the
market. Broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the
market price of our common stock.

Future sales
of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may
depress our stock price.

A number of our shareholders own a substantial
amount of our common stock. If our significant shareholders or
we sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public
market, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales
by our significant shareholders, including Amgen, Aventis, and
Novartis, also might make it more difficult for us to sell
equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and
price that we deemed appropriate.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
    About Market Risk.

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to
fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our
investment of available cash balances in investment grade
corporate and U.S. government securities. We do not believe we
are materially exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our
current policies we do not use interest rate derivative
instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We
estimated that a one percent change in interest rates would
result in an approximately $1.4 million and
$0.7 million change in the fair market value of our
investment portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The increase is due primarily to a higher
investment portfolio balance and slightly longer duration as of
December 31, 2003 in comparison to 2002.

Controls and Procedures

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The evaluation was conducted under the
supervision and with the participation of Leonard S. Schleifer,
our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Murray A.
Goldberg, our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon this
evaluation, each of Dr. Schleifer and Mr. Goldberg
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting them to material information
required to be included in our filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. There has been no significant change in
our internal controls over financial reporting during the period
covered by this report that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.



Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system are met and cannot detect all
deviations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or
deviations, if any, within the company have been detected. While
we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures have been
effective, in light of the foregoing, we intend to continue to
examine and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and
monitor ongoing developments in this area.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

In our opinion, based upon our audits and the
report of other auditors, the accompanying balance sheets and
the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
“Company”) at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of Amgen-Regeneron Partners (the
“Partnership”), an entity which is fifty percent owned
by the Company, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The
Company’s investment in the Partnership is accounted for in
accordance with the equity method of accounting. For the year
ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded its pro rata
share of the Partnership’s net loss of approximately $1.0
million. The Partnership’s financial statements were
audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been
furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it
relates to the amounts included for the Partnership, is based
solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, during the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

1.     Organization
and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
“Company” or “Regeneron”) was incorporated
in January 1988 in the State of New York. The Company is engaged
in research and development programs to discover and
commercialize therapeutics to treat human disorders and
conditions. The Company’s facilities are located in New
York. The Company’s business is subject to certain risks
including, but not limited to, uncertainties relating to
conducting pharmaceutical research, obtaining regulatory
approvals, commercializing products, and obtaining and enforcing
patents.

2.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Property, Plant, and
    Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the
useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred.
The cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets
retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and
any gain or loss is recognized in operations. The estimated
useful lives of property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

6-30 years

Leasehold improvements

Life of lease

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Costs of construction of certain long-lived
assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the
estimated useful life of the related asset. The Company
capitalized interest costs of $0.6 million and
$0.2 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company periodically assesses the
recoverability of property and equipment and evaluates such
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Asset impairment is determined to exist if
estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the
carrying amount in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. As of
December 31, 2003, there were no impairments of long-lived
assets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and
the balance sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported
in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates
its fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined based on standards that approximate
the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are shown net of
applicable reserves.

Revenue Recognition and Change in
    Accounting Principle

a.

Contract Research and Development and Research
    Progress Payments

The Company recognizes revenue from contract
research and development and research progress payments in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB 104”) and

F-8


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

FASB Emerging Issue Task Force Issue
No. 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”).
SAB 104 superseded Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statement

(“SAB 101”), in December 2003. During the
third quarter of 2003, the Company elected to change the method
it uses to recognize revenue under SAB 101 related to
non-refundable collaborator payments, including up-front
licensing payments, payments for development activities, and
research progress (milestone) payments, to the Substantive
Milestone Method, adopted retroactively to January 1, 2003.
There is no cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle on prior periods. Under this method, the Company
recognizes revenue from non-refundable up-front license
payments, not tied to achieving a specific performance
milestone, ratably over the period over which the Company is
obligated to perform services. Payments for development
activities are recognized as revenue as earned, ratably over the
period of effort. Substantive at-risk milestone payments, which
are based on achieving a specific performance milestone, are
recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the
related payment is due, provided there is no future service
obligation associated with that milestone. The change in
accounting method was made because the Company believes that it
better reflects the substance of the Company’s
collaborative agreements and is more consistent with current
practices in the biotechnology industry.

Previously, the Company had recognized revenue
from non-refundable collaborator payments based on the
percentage of costs incurred to date, estimated costs to
complete, and total expected contract revenue. However, the
revenue recognized was limited to the amount of non-refundable
payments received. This accounting method was adopted on
January 1, 2000 upon the release of SAB 101. Prior to
January 1, 2000, revenue from certain non-refundable
collaborator payments was recognized when there were no
additional contractual services to be provided or costs to be
incurred by the Company in connection with the non-refundable
payment. The cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 at
January 1, 2000 amounted to $1.6 million of additional
loss, with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue that is
being recognized in subsequent periods, of which
$0.4 million was included in contract research and
development revenue in each of 2003, 2002, and 2001. The
$1.6 million represents a portion of a 1989 payment
received from Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. in consideration for a
fifteen year limited right of first negotiation to license up to
three of the Company’s product candidates in Japan (see
Note 11d). The effect of income taxes on the cumulative
effect adjustment was immaterial.

b.

Contract Manufacturing

The Company has entered into contract
manufacturing agreements under which it manufactures products
and performs services for third parties. Contract manufacturing
revenue is recognized as products are shipped and as services
are performed (see Notes 11d and 12).

Investment Income

Interest income, which is included in investment
income, is recognized as earned.

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, are
reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Estimated
undiscounted expected future cash flows are used to determine if
an asset is impaired in which case the asset’s carrying
value would be reduced to fair value. For all periods presented,
no impairment losses were recorded.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

Patents

As a result of the Company’s research and
development efforts, it has obtained, applied, or is applying
for a number of patents to protect proprietary technology and
inventions. All costs associated with patents are expensed as
incurred.

Research and Development
    Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs
directly attributable to the conduct of research and development
programs, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
collaboration and licensing agreements (see Note 10f), the
cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
services related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical
trial expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, expenses
related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to
commencing commercial production of a product under contract
manufacturing arrangements, and the allocable portions of
facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and
maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All
costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.

For each clinical trial that the Company
conducts, certain clinical trial costs, which are included in
research and development expenses, are expensed based on the
expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at
which patients enter the trial, and the period over which
clinical investigators or contract research organizations are
expected to provide services. During the course of a clinical
trial, the Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense
recognition if actual results differ from the Company’s
estimates.

Net Loss Per Share

Net loss per share, basic and diluted, is
computed on the basis of the net loss for the period divided by
the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
Class A Stock outstanding during the period. The basic net
loss per share excludes restricted stock awards until vested.
The diluted net loss per share for all periods presented
excludes unvested restricted stock awards and the number of
shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible debt
and exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, since
such inclusion would be antidilutive. Disclosures required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share

, have been included in Note 18.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets
are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial
reporting amounts (“temporary differences”) at enacted
tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for
deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain. See
Note 16.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss represents the change in net
assets of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. Comprehensive loss of the Company includes net loss
adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or loss on
marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
comprehensive loss is immaterial. Comprehensive losses for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 have been
included in the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted marketable
securities, and receivables from Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
Novartis Pharma AG, The Procter & Gamble Company,
and Merck & Co., Inc. The Company generally invests its
excess cash in obligations of the U.S. government and its
agencies, bank deposits, investment grade debt securities issued
by corporations, governments, and financial institutions, and
money market funds that invest in these instruments. The Company
has established guidelines that relate to credit quality,
diversification, and maturity, and that limit exposure to any
one issue of securities.

Risks and Uncertainties

Regeneron has had no sales of its products and
there is no assurance that the Company’s research and
development efforts will be successful, that the Company will
ever have commercially approved products, or that the Company
will achieve significant sales of any such products. The Company
has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations
since its inception, and revenues to date have principally been
limited to payments for research from six collaborators and for
contract manufacturing from two pharmaceutical companies and
investment income (see Notes 11 and 12). The Company operates in
an environment of rapid change in technology and is dependent
upon the services of its employees, consultants, collaborators,
and certain third-party suppliers of materials. Regeneron, as
licensee, licenses certain technologies that are important to
the Company’s business which impose various obligations on
the Company. If Regeneron fails to comply with these
requirements, licensors may have the right to terminate the
Company’s licenses.

Contract research and development revenue in 2003
was primarily earned from Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis
Pharma AG, and The Procter & Gamble Company under
collaboration agreements (see Notes 11a, 11b and 11e).
Under the collaboration agreement with Aventis, agreed upon
VEGF Trap development expenses incurred by Regeneron during
the term of the agreement will be funded by Aventis. In
addition, the Company may receive a $25.0 million payment
upon achievement of an early-stage clinical milestone and up to
$360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified VEGF Trap marketing approvals. Aventis
has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at
least twelve months advance notice. Under the collaboration
agreement with Novartis, agreed upon IL-1 Trap development
expenses will either be shared with or fully funded by Novartis,
depending on the phase of clinical development. The agreement
with Novartis contains provisions for termination, including
termination by Novartis without cause with at least nine months
advance notice. Under the long-term collaboration with
Procter & Gamble, Procter & Gamble is
obligated to provide payments to fund Regeneron research of
$2.5 million per quarter, before adjustments for inflation,
through December 2005, with no further research obligations by
either party thereafter. Contract manufacturing revenue in 2003
was earned from Merck & Co., Inc. under a long-term
manufacturing agreement that extends until November 2005 (see
Note 12), but may be terminated at any time by Merck with
at least one year’s notice without penalty and may be
extended by mutual agreement.

The Company has entered into a license and supply
agreement with Nektar Therapeutics under which Nektar is the
only supplier of a pegylated reagent used to formulate pegylated
AXOKINE, one of our product candidates.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Significant estimates include useful lives of
property, plant, and equipment and the periods over which
certain revenues and

expenses will be recognized, including contract
research and development revenue recognized from non-refundable
up-front licensing payments, contract manufacturing revenue
recognized from reimbursed deferred capital costs, and expense
recognition of certain clinical trial costs which are included
in research and development expenses.

Stock-based Employee
    Compensation

The accompanying financial position and results
of operations of the Company have been prepared in accordance
with APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

(“APB No. 25”). Under
APB No. 25, generally, no compensation expense is
recognized in the accompanying financial statements in
connection with the awarding of stock option grants to employees
provided that, as of the grant date, all terms associated with
the award are fixed and the quoted market price of the
Company’s stock, as of the grant date, is equal to or less
than the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock as
defined.

The Company has stock-based incentive plans,
which are more fully described in Note 14a. The following
table illustrates the effect on the Company’s net loss and
net loss per share had compensation costs for the incentive
plans been determined in accordance with the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation as prescribed
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”). Since option grants
awarded during 2003, 2002, and 2001 vest over several years and
additional awards are expected to be issued in the future, the
pro forma results shown below are not likely to be
representative of the effects on future years of the application
of the fair value based method.

In 2003, the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer was granted permission by the Board of Directors to
initiate a one-time net cashless exercise of stock options. Upon
completion of the net cashless exercise, the Company recognized
$0.3 million of compensation expense, which equaled the
excess of the fair market value of the shares over the option
exercise price on the date that the Board of Directors granted
its consent for the transaction.

Other disclosures required by
SFAS No. 123 have been included in Note 14a.

Statement of Cash Flows

Supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and
financing activities:

In 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company awarded
219,367, 139,611, and 80,535 shares, respectively, of
Restricted Stock under the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (see Note 14a). The Company
records unearned compensation in Stockholders’ Equity
related to these awards based on the fair

market value of shares of the Company’s
Common Stock on the grant date of the Restricted Stock award,
which is expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the approximately
two year period that the restrictions on these shares lapse. In
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized $2.3 million,
$1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of
compensation expense related to Restricted Stock awards.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses
at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 were
$0.8 million, $13.5 million, and $1.9 million of
capital expenditures, respectively.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses
at December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were
$0.7 million, $0.8 million, and $0.5 million,
respectively, of accrued 401(k) Savings Plan contribution
expense. During the first quarter of 2003, 2002, and 2001, the
Company contributed 42,543, 21,953, and 17,484 shares,
respectively, of Common Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in
satisfaction of these obligations.

Included in marketable securities at
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 were $0.9 million,
$2.0 million, and $2.0 million of accrued interest
income, respectively.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the
financial statements for 2002 and 2001 to conform with the
current year’s presentation.

Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
    Standards

In December 2003, the Staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued SAB 104,

Revenue
Recognition

, which supercedes SAB 101,

Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements

. SAB 104’s
primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in
SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements,
superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21,

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the
SEC’s

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

(the “FAQ”)
issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in
SEC Topic 13,

Revenue Recognition

. Selected
portions of the FAQ have been incorporated into SAB 104.
While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the
issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles
of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of
SAB 104. Adoption of SAB 104 was required immediately
and did not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

(“FIN 46R”), which was issued in January 2003.
FIN 46R clarifies the application of ARB No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

to certain entities in
which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity
at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46R requires
the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest
entities (“VIEs”), by the primary beneficiary of the
entity. The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that will
absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive
a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or
both. Among other changes, the revisions of FIN 46R
(a) clarified some requirements of the original FIN 46,
which had been issued in January 2003, (b) eased some
implementation problems, and (c) added new scope
exceptions. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of the
Interpretation for public companies to the end of the first
reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, except that
all public companies must at a minimum apply the provisions of
the Interpretation to entities that were previously considered
“special-purpose entities” under the FASB literature
prior to the issuance of FIN 46R by the end of the first
reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. Adoption
of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement No. 150 (“SFAS No. 150”),

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

. SFAS

F-13


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

No. 150 specifies that instruments within
its scope embody obligations of the issuer and that the issuer
must classify them as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 requires
issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of
freestanding financial instruments: (1) mandatorily
redeemable financial instruments, (2) obligations to
repurchase the issuer’s equity shares by transferring
assets, and (3) certain obligations to issue a variable
number of shares. SFAS No. 150 defines a “freestanding
financial instrument” as a financial instrument that
(1) is entered into separately and apart from any of the
entity’s other financial instruments or equity transactions
or (2) is entered into in conjunction with some other
transaction and can be legally detached and exercised on a
separate basis. For all financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, SFAS No. 150 is effective
immediately. For all other instruments of public companies, SFAS
No. 150 went into effect at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption
of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements. In November 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board deferred the effective date
for selected provisions of SFAS No. 150, limited to
mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with
finite-lived subsidiaries. The deferral of those selected
provisions is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45 (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation
of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of
FASB Interpretation No. 34.

FIN 45 elaborates on
the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and
annual financial statements about its obligations under
guarantees issued. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is
required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial
recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable
to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002
and did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

3.     Marketable
Securities

The Company considers its unrestricted marketable
securities to be “available-for-sale,” as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses are
reported as a net amount in a separate component of
stockholders’ equity entitled Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss). The net change in unrealized
holding gains and losses is excluded from operations and
included in stockholders’ equity as a separate component of
comprehensive loss.

The following tables summarize the amortized cost
basis of marketable securities, the aggregate fair value of
marketable securities, and gross unrealized holding gains and
losses at December 31, 2003 and 2002:

Realized gains and losses are included as a
component of investment income. For the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, gross realized gains and
losses were not significant. In computing realized gains and
losses, the Company computes the cost of its investments on a
specific identification basis. Such cost includes the direct
costs to acquire the securities, adjusted for the amortization
of any discount or premium. The fair value of marketable
securities has been estimated based on quoted market prices.
Unrealized holding losses at December 31, 2003 have been
losses for less than one year.

9.     Stockholders’
Equity

The Company’s Amended Certificate of
Incorporation provides for the issuance of up to 40 million
shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and
160 million shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share. Shares of Class A Stock are convertible, at any
time, at the option of the holder into shares of Common Stock on
a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class A Stock have
rights and privileges identical to Common Stockholders except
that Class A Stockholders are entitled to ten votes per
share, while Common Stockholders are entitled to one vote per
share. Class A Stock may only be transferred to specified
Permitted Transferees, as defined. The Company’s Board of
Directors (the “Board”) is authorized to issue up to
30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined
by the Board.

During 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan in which Rights were distributed as a dividend at
the rate of one Right for each share of Common Stock and
Class A Stock (collectively, “Stock”)

F-17


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

held by shareholders of record as of the close of
business on October 18, 1996. Each Right initially entitles
the registered holder to buy a unit (“Unit”)
consisting of one-one thousandth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock (“A Preferred
Stock”) at a purchase price of $120 per Unit (the
“Purchase Price”). Initially the Rights were attached
to all Stock certificates representing shares then outstanding,
and no separate Rights certificates were distributed. The Rights
will separate from the Stock and a “distribution date”
will occur upon the earlier of (i) ten days after a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons, excluding certain defined persons, (an “Acquiring
Person”) has acquired, or has obtained the right to
acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Stock or (ii) ten business days following the
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would
result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of
such outstanding shares of Stock. The Rights are not exercisable
unless a distribution date occurs and will expire at the close
of business on October 18, 2006 unless earlier redeemed by
the Company, subject to certain defined restrictions, for $.01
per Right. In the event that an Acquiring Person becomes the
beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares
of Stock (unless such acquisition is made pursuant to a tender
or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of the Company, at
a price determined by a majority of the independent directors of
the Company who are not representatives, nominees, affiliates,
or associates of an Acquiring Person to be fair and otherwise in
the best interest of the Company and its shareholders after
receiving advice from one or more investment banking firms),
each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the
Right’s then current exercise price, common shares (or, in
certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the
Company) having a value twice the Right’s Exercise Price.
The Right’s Exercise Price is the Purchase Price times the
number of shares of Common Stock associated with each Right
(initially, one). Upon the occurrence of any such events, the
Rights held by an Acquiring Person become null and void. In
certain circumstances, a Right entitles the holder to receive,
upon exercise, shares of common stock of an acquiring company
having a value equal to two times the Right’s Exercise
Price.

As a result of the Shareholder Rights Plan, the
Company’s Board designated 100,000 shares of preferred
stock as A Preferred Stock. The A Preferred Stock has
certain preferences, as defined.

In April 2000, the Company completed a public
offering of 2.6 million shares of Common Stock at a price
of $29.75 per share for net proceeds, after commissions and
expenses, of $72.9 million. In March and April 2001, the
Company completed a public offering in which it issued
6.63 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $25.00
per share and received proceeds, after commissions and expenses,
of $156.7 million.

In March 2001, Medtronic, Inc. exercised 107,400
warrants with an exercise price of $21.72 per share on a
“cashless” basis and received 37,306 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock.

In October 2001, the Company completed a private
placement of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of
senior subordinated notes, which are convertible into shares of
the Company’s Common Stock. See Note 10e.

In March 2003, Novartis Pharma AG purchased
$48.0 million of newly issued unregistered shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. Regeneron issued 2,400,000 shares
of Common Stock to Novartis in March 2003 and an additional
5,127,050 shares in May 2003 for a total of 7,527,050 shares
based upon the average closing price of the Common Stock for the
20 consecutive trading days ending May 12, 2003. See
Note 11b.

In August 2003, Regeneron issued to Merck &
Co., Inc., 109,450 newly issued unregistered shares of the
Company’s Common Stock as consideration for a non-exclusive
license agreement granted by Merck to the Company. See
Note 10f.

In September 2003, Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.

10.     Commitments
and Contingencies

a.     Operating
    Leases

The Company leases and subleases laboratory,
manufacturing, and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York
under operating lease agreements which, as of December 31,
2003, expired through December 2006. In January 2004, the
Company extended these leases, which, as amended, expire through
December 2009 and contain renewal options for lease extensions
on certain facilities through December 2014. The Company also
leases manufacturing, office, and warehouse facilities in
Rensselaer, New York under an operating lease agreement which
expires in July 2007 and contains renewal options to extend the
lease for two additional five-year terms and a purchase option.
The leases provide for base rent plus additional rental charges
for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses, as defined.

The Company leases certain laboratory and office
equipment under operating leases which expire at various times
through 2007.

At December 31, 2003, the future minimum
noncancelable lease commitments under operating leases were as
follows:

Rent expense under operating leases was:

In addition to its rent expense for various
facilities, the Company paid additional rental charges for
utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses of
$6.0 million, $3.6 million, and $3.0 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

b.     Capital
    Leases

In 2003 and prior years, the Company had leased
equipment under noncancelable capital leases. Lease terms were
generally four years after which, for certain leases, the
Company purchased the equipment at amounts defined by the
agreements. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no
remaining capital leases outstanding.

At December 31, 2002, leased equipment and
building improvements included in property, plant, and equipment
was $1.1 million; related accumulated depreciation was
$0.9 million.

c.     Note
    Payable

In 1994, the Company borrowed $2.0 million
from the New York State Urban Development Corporation. The terms
of the note provided for monthly payments of principal and
interest through December 2014. In October 2001, the remaining
principal balance on this note of $1.5 million was paid in
full.

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

d.     Loan
    Payable

In March 2003, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma AG
(“Novartis”). In accordance with that agreement,
Regeneron funded its share of 2003 development expenses through
a loan from Novartis, which bears interest at a rate per annum
equal to the LIBOR rate plus 2.5%, compounded quarterly (3.65%
at December 31, 2003). The loan and accrued interest
thereon will be forgiven should certain defined pre-clinical and
clinical milestones be reached; otherwise, such amounts are
payable on July 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2003, the
loan due Novartis, including accrued interest, totaled
$13.8 million. See Note 11b.

e.     Convertible
    Debt

In October 2001, the Company issued
$200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
senior subordinated notes (“Notes”) in a private
placement for proceeds to the Company of $192.7 million,
after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and
out-of-pocket expenses (collectively, “Deferred Financing
Costs”). The Notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable
semi-annually, and mature on October 17, 2008. Deferred
Financing Costs, which are included in other assets, are
amortized as interest expense over the period from the
Notes’ issuance to stated maturity. The Notes are
convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into
shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price
of approximately $30.25 per share, subject to adjustment in
certain circumstances. Regeneron may redeem the Notes, in whole
or in part, at any time before October 17, 2004 if the
closing price of the Company’s Common Stock has exceeded
150% of the conversion price then in effect for a specified
period of time (“Early Redemption”). Upon any such
Early Redemption, the Company is required to pay interest that
would have been due up through October 17, 2004. Regeneron
may also redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after
October 17, 2004 if the closing price of the Company’s
Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in
effect for a specified period of time. The fair market value of
the Notes fluctuates over time. The estimated fair value of the
Notes at December 31, 2003 was approximately
$190.3 million.

With respect to the Notes, the Company pledged as
collateral $31.6 million of U.S. government securities
(“Restricted Marketable Securities”) with maturities
at various dates through October 2004. At December 31,
2003, the balance of the Restricted Marketable Securities had an
amortized cost basis of $10.9 million, due to scheduled
interest payments made on the Notes in 2002 and 2003. Upon
maturity, the proceeds of the Restricted Marketable Securities
will be sufficient to pay the scheduled interest payments on the
Notes when due in 2004. The Company considers its Restricted
Marketable Securities to be “held-to-maturity,” as
defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities

. These securities are reported at their
amortized cost, which includes the direct costs to acquire the
securities, plus the amortization of any discount or premium,
and accrued interest earned on the securities.

based on quoted market prices.

f.     Research
Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company’s research and
development efforts, the Company enters into research
collaboration and licensing agreements with related and
unrelated companies, scientific collaborators, universities, and
consultants. The Company also has research collaborations with
Medarex, Inc. and Emisphere Technologies, Inc., and a license
and supply agreement with Nektar Therapeutics. These agreements
contain varying terms and provisions which include fees and
milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be provided,
and ownership rights to certain proprietary technology developed
under the agreements. Some of the agreements contain provisions
which require the Company to pay royalties, as defined, at rates
that range from 0.25% to 12%, in the event the Company sells or
licenses any proprietary products developed under the respective
agreements.

Certain agreements, where the Company is required
to pay fees, provide for the Company, upon 30 to 90-day written
notice, to terminate such agreements. With respect to payments
associated with these agreements, the Company incurred expenses
of $2.7 million, $1.7 million, and $1.1 million
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

In August 2003, Merck & Co., Inc.
(“Merck”) granted the Company a non-exclusive license
agreement to certain patents and patent applications which may
be used in the development and commercialization of
AXOKINE®. As consideration, the Company issued to Merck
109,450 newly issued unregistered shares of its Common Stock
(the “Merck Shares”), valued at $1.5 million
based on the fair market value of shares of the Company’s
Common Stock on the agreement’s effective date. The
agreement also requires the Company to make an additional
payment to Merck upon receipt of marketing approval for a
product covered by the licensed patents. In addition, the
Company would be required to pay royalties, at staggered rates
in the mid-single digits, based on the net sales of products
covered by the licensed patents.

At any time prior to the date that Merck has the
right to sell the Merck Shares under the Securities Act of 1933
(the “Sales Date”), Regeneron has the right to buy
back the Merck Shares from Merck for a purchase price equal to
the greater of (a) $1.5 million and (b) the lesser of
(i) the fair market value of the shares and (ii)
$1.65 million. Unless Regeneron has previously exercised
its right to buy back the Merck Shares, on the Sales Date if the
fair market value of the Merck Shares (the “Market
Price”) is less than

F-21


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

$1.5 million, Regeneron will be required to
make a cash payment to Merck equal to the difference between the
Market Price and $1.5 million. Conversely, if on the Sales
Date the Market Price is greater than $1.65 million, Merck
will be required, at its option, to either (i) make a cash
payment to Regeneron equal to the difference between the Market
Price and $1.65 million (the “Excess Amount”) or
(ii) return a number of the Merck Shares to Regeneron,
calculated by dividing the Excess Amount by the fair market
value of a share of the Company’s Common Stock on the Sales
Date. The fair market value of the shares based on the
Company’s closing Common Stock price at December 31,
2003, was $1.6 million.

11.     Collaboration
Agreements

a.     Aventis
    Pharmaceuticals Inc.

In September 2003, the Company entered into
a collaboration agreement (the “Aventis Agreement”)
with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Aventis”) to
jointly develop and commercialize the Company’s Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (“VEGF”) Trap throughout the
world with the exception of Japan, where product rights remain
with Regeneron. In connection with this agreement, Aventis made
a non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and
purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of the
Company’s Common Stock for $45.0 million, based upon
the average closing price of the Common Stock for the five
consecutive trading days ending September 4, 2003.

Under the Aventis Agreement, Regeneron and
Aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if
any, of the VEGF Trap. Aventis has agreed to make a
$25.0 million payment to the Company upon achievement of an
early-stage clinical milestone. The Company may also receive up
to $360.0 million in additional milestone payments upon
receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight VEGF
Trap indications in Europe or the United States.

Under the Aventis Agreement, agreed upon
development expenses incurred by both companies during the term
of the agreement will be funded by Aventis. If the collaboration
becomes profitable, Regeneron will reimburse Aventis for
50 percent of the VEGF Trap development expenses, or
$10.8 million as of December 31, 2003, in accordance
with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and
Regeneron’s share of the collaboration profits, or at a
faster rate at Regeneron’s option. Regeneron has the option
to conduct additional pre-Phase III studies at its own
expense.

Aventis has the right to terminate the agreement
without cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon
termination of the agreement for any reason, Regeneron’s
obligation with respect to reimbursing Aventis, from a portion
of the Company’s profits, for 50 percent of the VEGF
Trap development expenses will also terminate and the Company
will retain all rights to the VEGF Trap.

Revenue related to payments from Aventis is being
recognized under the Substantive Milestone Method (see
Note 2) in accordance with SAB 104. The up-front
payment of $80.0 million and reimbursement of
Regeneron-incurred development expenses are being recognized as
contract research and development revenue. Milestone payments
will be recognized as research progress payments. In 2003 the
Company recognized $14.3 million of contract research and
development revenue in connection with the Aventis Agreement. At
December 31, 2003, amounts receivable from Aventis totaled
$8.9 million and deferred revenue was $76.4 million.

b.     Novartis
Pharma AG

In March 2003, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement (the “Novartis Agreement”)
with Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) to jointly
develop and commercialize the Company’s Interleukin-1
Cytokine Trap (“IL-1 Trap”). In connection with
this agreement, Novartis made a non-refundable up-front payment
of $27.0 million and purchased $48.0 million of newly
issued unregistered shares of the Company’s

F-22

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

Common Stock. Regeneron issued
2,400,000 shares of Common Stock to Novartis in
March 2003 and an additional 5,127,050 shares in
May 2003 for a total of 7,527,050 shares based upon
the average closing price of the Common Stock for the 20
consecutive trading days ending May 12, 2003.

Development expenses incurred during 2003 were
shared equally by the Company and Novartis. Regeneron funded its
share of 2003 development expenses through a loan (the
“2003 Loan”) from Novartis, which bears interest at a
rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus 2.5%, compounded
quarterly (3.65% at December 31, 2003). The 2003 Loan and
accrued interest thereon will be forgiven should certain defined
pre-clinical and clinical milestones be reached; otherwise, such
amounts are payable on July 1, 2004. As of
December 31, 2003, the 2003 Loan balance due Novartis,
including accrued interest, totaled $13.8 million.

Revenue related to payments from Novartis is
being recognized as contract research and development revenue
under the Substantive Milestone Method (see Note 2) in
accordance with SAB 104. The up-front payment of
$27.0 million and reimbursement of Novartis’ share of
Regeneron-incurred development expenses are being recognized as
contract research and development revenue. Forgiveness of the
2003 Loan and accrued interest (if forgiven as described above)
will be recognized as a research progress payment. In 2003 the
Company recognized $21.4 million of contract research and
development revenue in connection with the Novartis Agreement.
At December 31, 2003, amounts receivable from Novartis
totaled $3.2 million and deferred revenue was
$22.1 million.

On February 27, 2004, the Company announced
that Novartis had provided notice of its intention not to
proceed with the joint development of the IL-1 Trap. Under
the terms of the collaboration agreement, Novartis remains
obligated to fund agreed upon pre-Phase III IL-1 Trap
development expenses during the nine-month notice period before
its voluntary termination becomes effective. Novartis and the
Company retain rights under the collaboration agreement to elect
to collaborate on the development and commercialization of other
IL-1 Trap antagonists being developed independently by the
other party that are in earlier stages of development than the
IL-1 Trap.

c.     Amgen
Inc.

In August 1990, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with
Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) to develop and attempt to
commercialize two proprietary products (BDNF and NT-3,
individually the “Product,” collectively the
“Products”). The Amgen Agreement, among other things,
provided for Amgen and the Company to form a partnership
(“Amgen-Regeneron Partners” or the
“Partnership”) to complete the development and to
commercialize the Products. Amgen and the Company hold equal
ownership interests (subject to adjustment for any future
inequities in capital contributions, as defined). The
Partnership is the exclusive distributor of Products in the
United States, and Amgen has received a license from the Company
to market the Products outside the United States and outside
Japan and certain Pacific Rim countries. The Company accounts
for its investment in the Partnership in accordance with the
equity method of accounting. In 2003, 2002, and 2001, the
Company recognized its share of the Partnership net loss in the
amounts of $63 thousand, $27 thousand, and
$1.0 million, respectively, which represents 50% of the
total Partnership net loss. In September 2002, the Company
and Amgen each made capital withdrawals of $0.5 million
from the Partnership. At December 31, 2003, the Company
continues to be an equal partner in the Partnership.

In January 2001, Amgen-Regeneron Partners
discontinued all clinical development of BDNF for the potential
treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”)
following notification that BDNF did not provide a therapeutic
advantage to ALS patients in clinical trials. The Partnership
has no ongoing development activities for NT-3 at this time.

Payments the Company receives from the
Partnership in connection with services provided to the
Partnership, are recognized as contract research and development
revenue as earned. Such revenue for the

years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and
2001 totaled $2 thousand, $2 thousand and
$1.2 million, respectively.

Selected financial data as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are not significant.
Selected financial data of the Partnership for the year ended
December 31, 2001 are as follows.

(1)

Includes $1.2 million related to services
    provided by the Company in 2001.

In October 2000, Amgen and Regeneron entered
into an agreement whereby Regeneron acquired Amgen’s
patents and patent applications relating to ciliary neurotrophic
factor (“CNTF”) and related molecules for
$1.0 million. As part of this agreement, Regeneron granted
back to Amgen exclusive, royalty free rights under these patents
and patent applications solely for human ophthalmic uses. In
addition, Regeneron entered into a covenant not to sue Amgen
under Regeneron’s patents and patent applications relating
to CNTF and related molecules solely for human ophthalmic uses.

In July 2002, Amgen and Immunex Corporation
(now part of Amgen) granted the Company a non-exclusive license
to certain patents and patent applications which may be used in
the development and commercialization of the IL-1 Trap. The
license followed two other licensing arrangements under which
Regeneron obtained a non-exclusive license to patents owned by
ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Tularik Inc. for use in connection with
the IL-1 Trap program. These license agreements would
require the Company to pay royalties based on the net sales of
the IL-1 Trap if and when it is approved for sale. In
total, the royalty rate under these three agreements would be in
the mid-single digits.

d.     Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals Company, Ltd.

In June 1994, the Company entered into a
research and development agreement (the “R&D
Agreement”) with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Company, Ltd.
(“Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals”) to collaborate in the
research and development of BDNF in Japan. In connection with
the R&D Agreement, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals made payments to
the Company for its activities in developing and validating
manufacturing processes for BDNF, and manufacturing and
supplying BDNF and other research materials to Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals. In 2001, Regeneron recognized contract research
and development revenue from Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals of
$0.1 million. In addition, the Company recognized contract
manufacturing revenue of $0.1 million in 2001 as supplies
of BDNF were received (FOB Destination Point) by Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals.

During 1989, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.
(“Sumitomo Chemical”), an affiliate of Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals, entered into a Technology Development Agreement
(“TDA”) with Regeneron and paid the Company
$5.6 million. In consideration for this payment, Sumitomo
Chemical received a fifteen year limited right of first
negotiation to license up to three of the Company’s product
candidates in Japan. In connection with the Company’s
implementation of SAB 101 (see Note 2), the Company is
recognizing this payment as revenue on a straight-line basis
over the term of the TDA.

e.     The
Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, the Company entered into a
long-term collaboration agreement with The Procter &
Gamble Company (“Procter & Gamble”) to
discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products

F-24


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

(the “P&G Agreement”) and
Procter & Gamble agreed to provide funding for
Regeneron’s research efforts related to the collaboration.
In connection with the collaboration, in June 1997 and
August 2000, Procter & Gamble purchased
4.35 million and 573,630 shares of the Company’s
Common Stock at $9.87 and $29.75 per share for a total of
$42.9 million and $17.1 million, respectively. In
June 1997, Procter & Gamble also received five
year warrants to purchase an additional 1.45 million shares
of the Company’s stock at $9.87 per share, which were
exercised in August 2000. As consideration for the exercise
price, Procter & Gamble tendered 511,125 shares of
the Company’s Common Stock which had an aggregate value at
the time of exercise, based upon the average market price of the
Company’s Common Stock over approximately the prior 30
trading days, equal to the aggregate exercise price of the
warrants. The net result of this warrant exercise was that
Procter & Gamble acquired an additional
938,875 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The
511,125 shares of Common Stock delivered to the Company by
Procter & Gamble were retired upon receipt. These
equity purchases were in addition to a purchase by
Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of 800,000
shares of the Company’s Common Stock for $10.0 million
that was completed in March 1997.

Effective December 31, 2000, the Company and
Procter & Gamble entered into a new collaboration
agreement, replacing the P&G Agreement. The new agreement
extends Procter & Gamble’s obligation to fund
Regeneron research through December 2005, with no further
research obligations by either party thereafter, and focuses the
companies’ collaborative research on therapeutic areas that
are of particular interest to Procter & Gamble. Under
the new agreement, research support from Procter &
Gamble is $2.5 million per quarter, before adjustments for
inflation, through December 2005. Any drugs that result
from the collaboration will continue to be jointly developed and
marketed worldwide, with the companies equally sharing
development costs and profits. Procter & Gamble and the
Company divided rights to programs from the
P&G Agreement that are no longer part of the
companies’ collaboration. Research funding from
Procter & Gamble related to the collaboration totaled
$80.0 million through December 31, 2003. In addition,
in 1997 through 1999, Procter & Gamble also provided
research support for the Company’s AXOKINE program and, as
a result, will be entitled to receive a small royalty on any
sales of AXOKINE.

Contract research and development revenue related
to the Company’s collaboration with Procter &
Gamble was $10.6 million, $10.5 million, and
$10.4 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. At
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Procter &
Gamble contract research revenue receivable was
$2.7 million, $2.6 million, and $2.7 million,
respectively.

12.     Manufacturing
Agreement

During 1995, the Company entered into a long-term
manufacturing agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., as
amended, (the “Merck Agreement”) to produce an
intermediate (the “Intermediate”) for a Merck
pediatric vaccine at the Company’s Rensselaer, New York
facility. The Company agreed to modify portions of its facility
for manufacture of the Intermediate and to assist Merck in
securing regulatory approval for such manufacture in the
Company’s facility. The Merck Agreement calls for the
Company to manufacture Intermediate for Merck for six years (the
“Production Period”), with certain minimum order
quantities each year. The Production Period commenced in
November of 1999, is expected to extend until
November 2005, and may be extended by mutual agreement.
Merck may terminate the agreement with at least one year’s
notice without payment of a termination fee.

Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the
capital costs to modify the facility (“Capital
Costs”). Merck also agreed to pay an annual facility fee
(the “Facility Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning
March 1995, subject to annual adjustment for inflation.
During the Production Period, Merck agreed to reimburse the
Company for certain manufacturing costs, pay the Company a
variable fee based on the quantity of Intermediate supplied to
Merck, and make additional bi-annual payments (“Additional
Payments”), as defined. In addition, Merck agreed to
reimburse the Company for the cost of Company activities
performed on behalf of Merck prior to the Production Period and
for miscellaneous costs during the Production Period

F-25


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

(“Internal Costs”). These payments are
recognized as contract manufacturing revenue as follows:
(i) payments for Internal Costs are recognized as the
activities are performed, (ii) the Facility Fee and
Additional Payments are recognized over the period to which they
relate, (iii) payments for Capital Costs were deferred and
are recognized as Intermediate is shipped to Merck, and
(iv) payments related to the manufacture of Intermediate
during the Production Period (“Manufacturing
Payments”) are recognized after the Intermediate is tested
and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck.

In 2003, 2002, and 2001, Merck contract
manufacturing revenue totaled $10.1 million,
$11.1 million, and $9.8 million, respectively. Such
amounts include $1.7 million, $1.8 million, and
$1.8 million of previously deferred Capital Costs,
respectively. In addition, Merck contract manufacturing revenue
for 2002 includes a non-recurring $1.0 million payment
received in August 2002 related to services the Company
provided in prior years.

13.     Supply
Agreement

In December 2002, the Company entered into
an agreement (the “Serono Agreement”) with
Serono S.A. (“Serono”) to use Regeneron’s
proprietary Velocigene technology platform to provide Serono
with knock-out and transgenic mammalian models of gene function
(“Materials”). Serono made an advance payment of
$1.5 million (the “Retainer”) to Regeneron in
December 2002, which was accounted for as deferred revenue.
Regeneron recognizes revenue and reduces the Retainer as
Materials are shipped to and accepted by Serono. The Serono
Agreement contains provisions for minimum yearly order
quantities and replenishment of the Retainer when the balance
declines below a specified threshold. In 2003, the Company
recognized $0.7 million of contract research and
development revenue in connection with the Serono Agreement.

14.     Incentive and
Stock Purchase Plans

a.     Long-Term
    Incentive Plans

During 2000, the Company established the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“2000 Incentive Plan”) which, as amended, provides
for the issuance of up to 11,000,000 shares of Common Stock
in respect of awards. In addition, shares of Common Stock
previously approved by shareholders for issuance under the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“1990 Incentive Plan”) that are not issued under the
1990 Incentive Plan, may be issued as awards under the 2000
Incentive Plan. Employees of the Company, including officers,
and nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members
of the Board of Directors, (collectively,
“Participants”) may receive awards as determined by a
committee of independent directors (“Committee”). The
awards that may be made under the 2000 Incentive Plan include:
(a) Incentive Stock Options (“ISOs”) and
Nonqualified Stock Options, (b) shares of Restricted Stock,
(c) shares of Phantom Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and
(e) Other Awards.

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right
to purchase shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the
Committee; however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise
price will not be less than the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest
over a period of time determined by the Committee, generally on
a pro rata basis over a three to five year period. The Committee
also determines the expiration date of each Option; however, no
ISO is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares
of restricted Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase
such shares at a price determined by the Committee. Such shares
are nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee
(“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as
defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the
Restricted Stock, which has not vested, will be transferred to
the Company, except under defined circumstances with Committee
approval, in consideration of amounts, if any,

F-26


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

paid by the Participant to acquire such shares.
In addition, if the Company requires a return of the Restricted
Shares, it also has the right to require a return of all
dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the
right to receive, within 30 days of the date on which the
share vests, an amount, in cash and/or shares of the
Company’s Common Stock as determined by the Committee,
equal to the sum of the fair market value of a share of Common
Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests and the
aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to a share
of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of the
share of Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests.
Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock
which are granted at the discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are
valued based on the Company’s Common Stock. Subject to the
provisions of the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions
of such Other Awards are determined solely on the authority of
the Committee.

During 1990, the Company established the 1990
Incentive Plan which, as amended, provided for a maximum of
6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of awards.
Employees of the Company, including officers, and nonemployees,
including consultants and nonemployee members of the Board of
Directors, received awards as determined by a committee of
independent directors. Under the provisions of the 1990
Incentive Plan, there will be no future awards from the plan.
Awards under the 1990 Incentive Plan consisted of Incentive
Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock Options which generally
vest on a pro rata basis over a three or five year period and
have a term of ten years.

The 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans contain
provisions that allow for the Committee to provide for the
immediate vesting of awards upon a change in control of the
Company, as defined.

The Company may incur charges to operations in
connection with awards from these Incentive Plans. In accordance
with APB No. 25 and related interpretations, the
Company will record compensation expense from employee
stock-based awards under certain conditions. Generally, when the
terms of the award and the amount the employee must pay to
acquire the stock are fixed, compensation expense for options,
restricted stock, and stock bonus awards will total the grant
date intrinsic value, if any, amortized over the vesting period.
For other awards, including phantom stock, compensation expense
will be recognized over the life of the award based on the cash
remitted to settle the award or the intrinsic value of the award
on the date of exercise.

Transactions involving stock option awards during
2003, 2002, and 2001, under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans,
are summarized in the table below. Option exercise prices were
equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common
Stock on the date of grant. The total number of options
exercisable at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was
5,940,268, 4,670,695, and 3,374,169, respectively, with weighted
average exercise prices of $19.45, $15.80, and $11.99,
respectively.

The following table summarizes stock option
information as of December 31, 2003:

The effect on the Company’s net loss and net
loss per share had compensation costs for the Incentive Plans
been determined in accordance with the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based compensation as prescribed by
SFAS No. 123 is shown in Note 2. For the purpose
of the pro forma calculation, the fair value of each option
granted from the Incentive Plans during 2003, 2002, and 2001 was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of the
options granted during 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $10.11, $14.10,
and $21.22, respectively. The following table summarizes the
assumptions used in computing the fair value of option grants.

F-28


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL

During 2003, 2002, and 2001, 219,367, 139,611,
and 80,535 shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock were
awarded under the 2000 Incentive Plan. These shares are
nontransferable with such restriction lapsing with respect to
25% of the shares every six months over a two-year period
beginning in January 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the
Company recorded unearned compensation within Stockholders’
Equity of $2.9 million, $2.7 million, and
$2.3 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, related
to these awards. This amount was based on the fair market value
of shares of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of
grant and will be expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the two
year period that the restriction on these shares lapses. During
2003, 2002 and 2001, 4,431, 2,183 and 1,413 shares,
respectively, of Restricted Stock were forfeited due to employee
terminations. The Company reduced unearned compensation within
Stockholders’ Equity by $0.1 million, in each of the
three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 related
to these forfeited awards.

The Company recognized compensation expense from
stock-based awards of $2.3 million $1.8 million, and
$0.7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

As of December 31, 2003, there were
1,653,642 shares available for future grants under the 2000
Incentive Plan.

b.     Executive
    Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock
Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) under which
1,027,500 shares of Class A Stock were reserved for
restricted stock awards. The Plan provides for the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors to award employees,
directors, consultants, and other individuals (“Plan
participants”) who render service to the Company the right
to purchase Class A Stock at a price set by the
compensation committee. The Plan provides for the vesting of
shares as determined by the compensation committee and, should
the Company’s relationship with a Plan participant
terminate before all shares are vested, unvested shares will be
repurchased by the Company at a price per share equal to the
original amount paid by the Plan participant. During 1989 and
1990, a total of 983,254 shares were issued, all of which
vested as of December 31, 1999. As of December 31,
2003, there were 44,246 shares available for future grants under
the Plan.

15.

Employee Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of
the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan
(the “Savings Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan
provide for employees who have met defined service requirements
to participate in the Savings Plan by electing to contribute to
the Savings Plan a percentage of their compensation to be set
aside to pay their future retirement benefits, as defined. The
Savings Plan, as amended and restated during 1998, provides for
the Company to make discretionary contributions
(“Contribution”), as defined. The Company recorded
Contribution expense of $0.9 million in 2003,
$0.8 million in 2002, and $0.8 million in 2001; such
amounts were accrued as liabilities at December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively. During the first quarter of 2004,
2003, and 2002, the Company contributed 64,333, 42,543, and
21,953 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings
Plan in satisfaction of these obligations.

16.

Income Taxes

There is no benefit for federal or state income
taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, since
the Company has incurred operating losses since inception and
established a valuation allowance equal to the total deferred
tax asset. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company capitalized research and development costs for tax
purposes resulting in taxable income of $7.0 million, which
was offset by net operating loss carryforwards. The effects of
the alternative minimum tax on the 2001 provision were
immaterial.

F-29


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

The tax effect of temporary differences, net
operating loss carry-forwards, and research and experimental tax
credit carry-forwards as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was
as follows:

For all years presented, the Company’s
effective income tax rate is zero. The difference between the
Company’s effective income tax rate and the Federal
statutory rate of 34% is attributable to state tax benefits and
tax credit carry-forwards offset by an increase in the deferred
tax valuation allowance.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
available for tax purposes unused net operating loss
carry-forwards of $340.2 million which will expire in various
years from 2006 to 2023. The Company’s research and
experimental tax credit carry-forwards expire in various years
from 2004 to 2023. Under the Internal Revenue Code and similar
state provisions, substantial changes in the Company’s
ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards that can be
utilized in future years to offset future taxable income. The
annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating
losses and tax credit carry-forwards before utilization.

In May 2003, securities class action lawsuits
were commenced against Regeneron and certain of the
Company’s officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The
complaints, which purport to be brought on behalf of a class
consisting of investors in the Company’s publicly traded
securities between March 28, 2000 and March 30, 2003,
allege that the defendants misstated or omitted material
information concerning the safety and efficacy of AXOKINE, in
violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder. Damages are sought in an unspecified amount. The
Company’s management believes that the lawsuits are without
merit. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be
determined. Accordingly, no provision for any liability that may
result upon the resolution of these matters has been made in the
accompanying financial statements.

The Company, from time to time, has been subject
to other legal claims arising in connection with its business.
While the ultimate results of the legal claims cannot be
predicted with certainty, at December 31, 2003 there were
no asserted claims against the Company which, in the opinion of
management, if adversely decided would have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows.

Net Loss Per Share

The Company’s basic net loss per share
amounts have been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding. In
2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company reported net losses and,
therefore, no common stock equivalents were included in the
computation of diluted

net loss per share since such inclusion would
have been antidilutive. The calculations of basic and diluted
net loss per share are as follows:

Shares issuable upon the exercise of options and
warrants, vesting of restricted stock awards, and conversion of
convertible debt, which have been excluded from the diluted per
share amounts because their effect would have been antidilutive,
include the following:

Unaudited Quarterly Results

elected to change the method it uses to recognize revenue under
SAB 101 related to non-refundable collaborator payments,
including up-front licensing payments, payments for development
activities, and research progress (milestone) payments, to
the Substantive Milestone Method, adopted retroactively to

Company’s financial results for any period prior to
