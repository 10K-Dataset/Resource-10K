PART I

Item 1.

Business

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties
relating to the future financial performance of Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and actual events or results may differ
materially. These statements concern, among other things, the
possible therapeutic applications of our product candidates and
research programs, the timing, nature, and success of the
clinical and research programs now underway or planned, and the
future sources and uses of capital and our financial needs.
These statements are made by us based on management’s
current beliefs and judgment. In evaluating such statements,
stockholders and potential investors should specifically
consider the various factors identified under the caption
“Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results”
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
indicated by such forward-looking statements. We do not
undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future
events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

General

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which may be
referred to as “we”, “us”, or
“our”, is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers,
develops, and intends to commercialize therapeutic drugs for the
treatment of serious medical conditions. Our product pipeline
includes product candidates for the treatment of obesity,
rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, cancer
and related disorders, allergies, asthma, and other diseases and
disorders. Developing and commercializing new drugs entails risk
and significant expense. Since inception we have not generated
any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our
product candidates.

Our core business strategy is to combine our
strong foundation in science and technology with
state-of-the-art manufacturing and clinical development
capabilities to build a successful, integrated biopharmaceutical
company. Our efforts have yielded a diverse and growing pipeline
of product candidates that have the potential to address a
variety of unmet medical needs. Our ability to develop product
candidates results from the application of our technology
platforms. In contrast to basic genomics approaches which
attempt to identify every gene in a cell or genome, our
technology platforms are designed to discover specific genes of
therapeutic interest for a particular disease or cell type. We
will continue to invest in the development of enabling
technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, and
commercialize new product candidates.

A key aspect of our strategy is to retain
significant ownership and commercialization rights to our
pipeline. Below is a summary of our leading clinical programs,
as well as several product candidates that are expected to enter
clinical trials over the next two years. We retain sole
ownership and marketing rights for each of these programs and
currently are developing them independent of any corporate
partners.

•

AXOKINE®:

Acts
	on the brain region regulating food intake and energy
	expenditure and is being developed for the treatment of obesity.
	In November 2000, we announced the preliminary results of a
	twelve-week Phase II dose-ranging trial of AXOKINE in 170
	severely obese patients. In the trial, AXOKINE was generally
	well tolerated and patients treated with AXOKINE showed
	medically meaningful and statistically significant weight loss
	compared to those receiving placebo. In September 2001, we
	reported that patients who completed 36 weeks of follow-up
	after cessation of AXOKINE treatment, on average, maintained the
	weight loss observed in the twelve-week treatment period. In
	July 2001, we initiated a Phase III clinical program of
	AXOKINE in overweight and obese patients. In January 2002, we
	announced that we had completed enrollment for a pivotal trial
	that includes approximately 2,000 patients in 65 sites
	across the United States.

•

PEGYLATED AXOKINE:

Chemically modified version of AXOKINE
	that is being developed as a more potent, longer-acting form of
	the protein. Pegylated AXOKINE currently is in late-stage
	preclinical development and we anticipate initiating a
	Phase I clinical trial in mid-2002.



In addition to the above programs which we are
conducting independent of any corporate partners, we have formed
collaborations to advance other research and development
efforts. We are conducting research with The Procter &
Gamble Company in muscle diseases and other fields. We are also
collaborating with Medarex, Inc. to discover, develop, and
commercialize certain human antibodies as therapeutics. In
partnership with Amgen Inc., we have development rights to
Neurotrophin-3, or NT-3, a clinical compound for the treatment
of constipating conditions, although there are no ongoing
development activities for NT-3 at this time. In all of these
research collaborations, we retain 50% of the commercialization
rights.

Our Independent Programs

The following table lists the programs and
product candidates for which we retain sole ownership and
marketing rights.



AXOKINE.

AXOKINE is our patented second
generation ciliary neurotrophic factor, called CNTF. We are
developing AXOKINE for the treatment of obesity.

Obesity is a major health problem in all
developed countries. The prevalence of obesity in the United
States has increased substantially during the past decade. A
1999 Congressional Report funded by the National Institutes of
Health confirmed that obesity significantly increases a number
of health risks, including Type II diabetes.
Obesity-related conditions, such as stroke and myocardial
infarction are estimated to contribute to about
300,000 deaths yearly, ranking second only to smoking as a
cause of preventable death. Health care expenditures for
obesity-related conditions now total over $200 billion a
year in the United States. Current treatment of obesity consists
of diet, exercise, and other lifestyle changes, and a limited
number of drugs. There are two approved drugs currently
indicated for the treatment of obesity — sibutramine
(Meridia®, a registered trademark of Knoll Pharmaceutical
Company) and orlistat (Xenical®, a registered trademark of
Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc.). According to their approved product
labels, over a twelve-month treatment period, these drugs, at
their approved starting doses, have produced weight loss of
between approximately five and nine pounds as compared to
patients taking placebo.

In November 2000, we announced the preliminary
results of a Phase II clinical trial, which tested the
safety and efficacy of AXOKINE in severely obese patients. This
Phase II trial was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, out-patient study conducted at seven sites
in the United States. Following an initial two-week “run-in
period,” all subjects received twelve weeks of daily
treatment, administered under the skin by patient
self-injection. A total of 170 patients were divided into
five patient groups. The first four patient groups comprised the
pre-specified population for the primary analyses and received
placebo, a daily dose of 0.3 micrograms (mcg) of AXOKINE
per kilogram (kg), a daily dose of 1.0 mcg/kg, or a daily
dose of 2.0 mcg/kg, in each case, over the twelve-week
treatment period. A fifth group received a daily dose of
1.0 mcg/kg for eight weeks, followed by a blinded
withdrawal period in which they received placebo for four weeks.
The pre-specified end points of the study were change in weight
for the patients who completed the full twelve weeks of
treatment (“Completer Analysis”), and change in weight
for all patients, whether or not they completed the full twelve
weeks of treatment (“Last Observed Value Analysis”).
All AXOKINE-treated groups showed medically meaningful and
statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo.
Summarized below are the results of the four groups comprising
the primary analyses.

As used in the table above, “n”
refers to the number of patients in each patient group. The
reference to “p” value (relative to placebo) means the
probability of being wrong when asserting that a true difference
exists between the results for the patient group in question and
the placebo group. For example, a p-value of less than 0.0001
indicates that there is a less than one in ten thousand chance
that the mean weight loss observed in the group treated with
drug and the mean weight loss observed in the group treated with
placebo are the same.

The trial established the optimal dose of AXOKINE
to be 1.0 mcg/kg daily. Patients who received the optimal
dose of AXOKINE over the twelve-week treatment period averaged
10 pounds more weight loss than patients on placebo.
Moreover, 46% of these patients in the optimal dose group lost
at least 10 pounds, compared to just 5% of the patients who
received placebo. Nausea was shown not to be a factor that
determined average weight loss in this Phase II Study.



The 38 patients in the fifth group who received
1.0 mcg/kg of AXOKINE daily for eight weeks followed by the
four week blinded withdrawal period lost weight during the
treatment period and did not regain weight while taking placebo
during the withdrawal period.

No serious adverse events associated with the
drug were reported during the trial and the drug was generally
well tolerated, as reflected by the following ratio of patients
in each treatment group completing the full twelve weeks of
treatment according to the protocol: placebo, 61%;
0.3 mcg/kg, 74%; 1.0 mcg/kg, 70%, and 2.0 mcg/kg,
58%. The most common side effect was dose-dependent injection
site reactions (skin redness), which occurred in all patient
groups, including placebo, and were generally mild. Other side
effects associated with the drug included cough and vomiting,
which were notable only in the 2.0 mcg/kg dose group, and
nausea, which occurred most frequently in the 2.0 mcg/kg
dose group. There was no increase compared to placebo in the
incidence of herpes simplex infections in patients taking
AXOKINE. Neutralizing antibodies, based on a laboratory test,
were not dose related and occurred in less than 10% of all
patients receiving AXOKINE.

In September 2001, we reported that the 45
patients who completed 36 weeks of follow-up after
cessation of treatment, on average, maintained the weight loss
observed in the twelve-week treatment period.

In July 2001, we initiated a Phase III
clinical program of AXOKINE in overweight and obese patients. We
announced in January 2002 that the initial trial was fully
enrolled with approximately 2,000 patients at 65 sites
across the United States. This trial is a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled study. It will have a
twelve-month treatment period, in which patients will receive
daily subcutaneous self-injections of placebo or AXOKINE at a
dose of 1.0 microgram (mcg) per kilogram (kg) of body
weight. The treatment period will be followed by a twelve-month
open-label safety extension phase, during which all patients
will receive AXOKINE. Endpoints of the study are based on
changes in body weight versus baseline during the treatment
period. As part of the overall Phase III program, Regeneron
will conduct additional confirmatory and ancillary studies of
AXOKINE in obese and obese diabetic patients. These studies will
vary in duration and size and are planned to be completed within
a similar time frame as the initial pivotal study described
above. The Phase III program is expected to enroll over
4,000 subjects in total.

In March 2000, we established a research and
development collaboration with Emisphere Technologies, Inc. to
utilize Emisphere’s oral drug delivery technology for
AXOKINE. In preliminary preclinical pharmacokinetic studies, the
Emisphere technology was able to achieve measurable blood levels
of AXOKINE.

Pegylated AXOKINE.

We are developing a pegylated version
of AXOKINE (pegAXOKINE) as a more potent, longer-acting form of
the protein. PegAXOKINE may allow for less frequent and/or lower
dosing in patients. PegAXOKINE currently is in late-stage
preclinical development and we anticipate initiating a
Phase I clinical trial in mid-2002. Shearwater Corporation,
now a subsidiary of Inhale Therapeutics Systems, Inc., has
contracted with us to develop and supply the pegylated reagent
for this product candidate.

Cytokine Traps.

Our
research on the CNTF class of neurotrophic factors led to the
discovery that CNTF, although it is a neurotrophic factor,
belongs to the “superfamily” of signaling molecules
referred to as cytokines. Cytokines are soluble proteins
secreted by the cells of the body. In many cases, cytokines act
as messengers to help regulate immune and inflammatory
responses. In excess, cytokines can be harmful and have been
linked to a variety of diseases. Blocking cytokines and growth
factors is a proven therapeutic approach with a number of drugs
already approved or in clinical development. The cytokine
superfamily includes factors such as erythropoietin,
thrombopoietin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and the
interleukins (or ILs).

In 1994, our scientists made a breakthrough in
understanding how receptors work for an entire class of
interleukins in the human body. Based on this finding, we
developed a family of antagonists referred to as “Cytokine
Traps.” This family includes Cytokine Traps for IL1, IL4,
and IL6 and a single Trap that blocks both IL4 and IL13. Because
these Traps mimic the body’s natural receptors, they are
effective at catching and holding the cytokines. With the
cytokines trapped, the immune system responds as if the
perceived threat is under control.



In preclinical studies, these Cytokine Traps are
more potent than other antagonists, potentially allowing lower
levels of these drug candidates to be used. Moreover, because
these Cytokine Traps are comprised entirely of natural
human-derived protein sequences, they may be less likely to
induce an immune reaction in humans. Because pathological levels
of IL1, IL4, IL6, and IL13 seem to contribute to a variety of
diseases, these Cytokine Traps have the potential to be
important therapeutic agents.

IL1 Trap.

In
December 2000, we initiated a Phase I study of the IL1 Trap
to assess its safety and tolerability in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis. The placebo-controlled, double-blind,
dose-escalation study was conducted at several centers in the
United States and included a single dose phase and a multiple
dose phase. In January 2002, we reported positive preliminary
results from the trial. In the trial, the IL1 Trap was evaluated
in four groups of 15-20 patients suffering from active
rheumatoid arthritis. Each group received six weekly doses of
IL1 Trap at one of the following dose levels: 0, 200, 400 or 800
milligrams/kilogram.

The preliminary results indicated that patients
treated with the IL1 Trap experienced dose dependent
improvements in tender and swollen joints and CRP levels, as
well as the composite ACR measure of disease activity. Patients
in the highest dose group experienced the largest improvement in
swollen and tender joint counts, with approximately 70% of
patients in the group (compared with approximately 46% of
placebo-treated patients) experiencing at least a 20% average
improvement in both swollen and tender joint counts, and
approximately 49% (compared with approximately 19% of
placebo-treated patients) experiencing a 50% average improvement
in both swollen and tender joint counts during the treatment
period. Similarly, blood levels of CRP, a well-validated and
objective indicator of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,
declined in a dose-dependent manner, with approximately 74% of
patients in the highest dose group (compared with approximately
36% of placebo-treated patients) experiencing at least a 20%
average improvement and approximately 49% (compared with
approximately 16% of placebo-treated patients) experiencing at
least a 50% average improvement during the treatment period.
More than 50% of patients receiving the highest dose responded
at the ACR-20 level (i.e., an improvement in ACR score of 20% or
more), compared with approximately 30% of placebo-treated
patients.

We expect to initiate a Phase II study of the IL1
Trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in mid-2002. The IL1
Trap is also being evaluated for potential uses in treating
other inflammatory diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease in
which the immune system attacks the tissue that lines and
cushions joints. Over time, the cartilage, bone, and ligaments
of the joint erode, leading to progressive joint deformity and
joint destruction, generally in the hand, wrist, knee, and foot.
Joints become painful and swollen and motion is limited. Over
time, the cartilage erodes, resulting in structural damage to
the joint. Over two million people, 1% of the U.S. population,
are estimated to have rheumatoid arthritis, and 10% of those
eventually become disabled. Women account for roughly two-thirds
of these patients.

IL4/IL13 Trap.

Antagonists for IL4 and IL13 may be
therapeutically useful in a number of allergy and asthma-related
conditions, including as an adjunct to vaccines where blocking
IL4 and IL13 may help to elicit more of the desired type of
immune response to the vaccine. We have developed both an IL4
Trap and an IL4/IL13 Trap, which is a single molecule that can
block both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. We expect to
initiate a clinical trial of a dual IL4/IL13 Trap to assess its
safety and tolerability for the treatment of asthma/
allergy-related conditions in mid-2002.

One in 13 Americans suffers from allergies and
one in 18 suffers from asthma. The number of people afflicted
with these diseases has been growing at an alarming rate. It is
believed that IL4 and IL13 play a role in these diseases. These
two cytokines are essential to the normal functioning of the
immune system, creating a vital communication link between white
blood cells. In the case of asthma and allergies, however, there
are too many interleukins present, causing the immune system to
overact. Our IL4/IL13 Trap may offer unique advantages over
other products and product candidates for asthma and
allergy-related conditions because of its ability to block both
of the cytokines thought to be at the root of these disorders.

Other Cytokine Traps.

We have research programs underway for
other Cytokine Traps. Our research regarding protein-based
cytokine antagonists currently includes molecular and cellular
research to improve or modify Cytokine Trap technology, process
development efforts to produce experimental and clinical research



supplies, and in vivo and in vitro studies to
further understand and demonstrate the efficacy of the Cytokine
Traps.

VEGF Trap and Angiopoietins.

A plentiful blood supply is required
to nourish every tissue and organ of the body. Diseases such as
diabetes and atherosclerosis wreak their havoc, in part, by
destroying blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) and
compromising blood flow. Decreases in blood flow (known as
ischemia) can result in non-healing skin ulcers and gangrene,
painful limbs that cannot tolerate exercise, loss of vision, and
heart attacks. In other cases, disease processes can damage
blood vessels by breaking down vessel walls, resulting in
defective and leaky vessels. Leaking vessels can lead to
swelling and edema, as occurs in brain tumors following ischemic
stroke, in diabetic retinopathy, and in arthritis and other
inflammatory diseases. Finally, some disease processes, such as
tumor growth, depend on the induction of new blood vessels.

Depending on the clinical situation, positively
or negatively regulating blood vessel growth could have
important therapeutic benefits, as could the repair of damaged
and leaky vessels. Thus, building new vessels, by a process
known as angiogenesis, can improve circulation to ischemic limbs
and heart, aid in healing of skin ulcers or other chronic
wounds, and in establishing tissue grafts. Reciprocally,
blocking tumor-induced angiogenesis can blunt tumor growth. In
addition, repairing leaky vessels can reverse swelling and edema.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was the
first growth factor shown to be specific for blood vessels, by
virtue of having its receptor specifically expressed on blood
vessel cells. Our scientists discovered a second family of
angiogenic growth factors, termed the Angiopoietins, and we have
received patents for the members of this family. The
Angiopoietins include naturally occurring positive and negative
regulators of angiogenesis, as described in numerous scientific
manuscripts published by our scientists and their collaborators.

Our studies have revealed that VEGF and the
Angiopoietins normally function in a coordinated and
collaborative manner during blood vessel growth. Thus, the
growth of new blood vessels to nourish ischemic tissue appears
to require use of both these agents. In addition, Angiopoietin-1
seems to play a critical role in stabilizing the vessel wall,
and the use of this growth factor can prevent or repair leaky
vessels in animal models. In terms of blocking vessel growth,
manipulation of both VEGF and Angiopoietin seems to be of value.

In November 2001, we initiated a Phase I
clinical trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of
VEGF Trap in patients with solid tumor malignancies and patients
with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The Phase I trial is an
open-label study in patients with advanced tumors and will
evaluate the VEGF Trap in increasing dose levels. The study is
being conducted at a clinical site in New York City.

We and others have identified a family of growth
factors termed the Ephrins and their receptors termed the Ephs.
Members of this family have specific roles in angiogenesis and
hemopoiesis, which are being pursued in preclinical studies.

Cartilage Growth Factor System and
Osteoarthritis.

Osteoarthritis results
from the wearing down of the articular cartilage surfaces that
cover joints. Thus, growth factors that specifically act on
cartilage cells could have utility in osteoarthritis. Our
scientists have discovered a growth factor receptor system
selectively expressed by cartilage cells, termed Regeneron
Orphan Receptor 2 (ROR2). Furthermore, our scientists have
demonstrated that this growth factor receptor system is required
for normal cartilage development in mice. In addition, together
with collaborators, our scientists have proven that mutations in
this growth factor receptor system cause inherited defects in
cartilage development in humans. Thus, this growth factor
receptor system is a promising new target for cartilage diseases
such as osteoarthritis.

Our Collaborative Programs

Muscle Atrophy and Related Disorders.

Muscle atrophy occurs in many
neuromuscular diseases and also when muscle is unused, as often
occurs during prolonged hospital stays and during convalescence.
Currently, physicians have few options to prescribe for patients
with muscle atrophy or other muscle conditions which afflict
millions of patients globally. Thus, a factor that might have
beneficial effects on skeletal muscle could have significant
clinical benefit. Our muscle program is currently focused on
conducting in vivo and in vitro experiments with the objective
of demonstrating and further understanding the molecular
mechanisms involved in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy. This work
is being conducted in collaboration with scientists at Procter
& Gamble as part of our collaboration.



NT-3.

The clinical
development of NT-3 by Amgen-Regeneron Partners, a general
partnership equally owned by us and Amgen, is currently focused
on the treatment of constipating conditions. In 2000 and 2001,
we, on behalf of Amgen-Regeneron Partners, conducted
Phase II studies of NT-3 in patients with functional
constipation and in spinal cord injury patients with bowel
dysfunction. There are no ongoing development activities for
NT-3 at this time. Amgen-Regeneron Partners has been developing
NT-3 in the United States under a license from Takeda Chemical
Industries, Ltd.

Other Early Stage Programs: Fibrosis and
G-Protein Coupled Receptors.

Fibrotic
diseases, such as cirrhosis, result from the excess production
of fibrous extracellular matrix by certain cell types that are
inappropriately activated in these diseases. We and our
collaborators identified orphan receptors, termed Discoidin
Domain Receptors 1 and 2 (DDR1 and DDR2), that are
expressed by the activated cell types in fibrotic disease. We
have further shown that these receptors bind and are activated
by the fibrous matrix they produce. Thus, these receptors are
important new targets in fibrotic disease.

Our work in this area is currently focused on
determining whether selective inhibition or activation of DDR1
and DDR2 would be beneficial in the setting of fibrotic disease.
Further, we are studying key signaling pathways which allow
particular fibrosis-inducing cells to multiply. Inhibition of
such pathways may be useful in preventing the development of
fibrosis. These research activities are being conducted in
collaboration with the scientists at Procter & Gamble.

We also have a research program focused on the
discovery and characterization of G-Protein Coupled Receptors,
which have historically been among the most useful targets for
pharmaceuticals. We use a genomics approach to discover new
receptors and then we characterize these receptors in our
disease models by examining their expression. Early stage
research work on selected G-Protein Coupled Receptors is being
conducted in collaboration with the scientists at Procter &
Gamble.

Our Technology Platforms

Our ability to discover and develop product
candidates for a wide variety of serious medical conditions
results from the leveraging of our powerful technology
platforms, many of which were developed or enhanced by us.
Although the primary use of these technology platforms is for
our own research and development programs, we are also exploring
the possibilities of exploiting these technologies commercially
through, for example, direct licensing or sale of technology, or
the establishment of research collaborations to discover and
develop drug targets.

Targeted
Genomics™

: In contrast to basic
genomics approaches, which attempt to identify every gene in a
cell or genome, we use Targeted Genomics approaches to identify
specific genes likely to be of therapeutic interest. These
approaches do not depend on random gene sequencing, but rather
on function-based approaches to specifically target the
discovery of genes for growth factors, peptides, and their
receptors that are most likely to have use for developing drug
candidates. This technology has already led to our discovery of
the Angiopoietin and Ephrin growth factor families for
angiogenesis and vascular disorders, the MuSK growth factor
receptor system for muscle disorders, and the Regeneron Orphan
Receptor (ROR) growth factor receptor system that regulates
cartilage formation.

High Throughput
Functionomics™

: A major challenge
facing the biopharmaceutical industry in the post-genomic era
involves the efficient assignment of function to random gene
sequences to enable the identification of validated drug
targets. One way to help determine the function of a gene is to
generate mice in which the gene is removed (referred to as
“knockout mice”), or is over-produced (referred to as
“transgenic mice”), or in which a color-producing gene
is substituted for the gene of interest (referred to as
“reporter knockin mice”) to identify which cells in
the body are expressing the gene. Until recently, technical
hurdles involved in the generation of mouse models restricted
the ability to produce multiple models quickly and efficiently.
We have developed proprietary technology that we believe will
allow for the rapid and efficient production of genetically
modified mice on a high throughput scale, enabling rapid
assignment of function to gene sequences.



Designer Protein
Therapeutics™

: In cases in which
the natural gene product is itself not a product candidate, we
utilize our Designer Protein Therapeutics platform to
genetically engineer product candidates with the desired
properties. We use these technologies to develop derivatives of
growth factors and their receptors, which can allow for modified
agonistic or antagonistic properties that may prove to be
therapeutically useful. Examples include the generation of
AXOKINE and the development of Cytokine Traps and the VEGF Trap.
This technology platform has already produced more than 10
patented proteins, including the IL1 Trap currently in
Phase I clinical testing, and several others in preclinical
development.

Collaborative Relationships

In addition to our independent programs, we
currently conduct programs in collaboration with academic and
corporate partners. We have entered into research collaboration
and licensing agreements with various corporate partners,
including Procter & Gamble, Medarex, Amgen, and Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals.

Procter & Gamble.

In May 1997, we entered into a
long-term collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble to
discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products. In
connection with the collaboration, Procter & Gamble made
Regeneron equity purchases of $42.9 million in June 1997
and $17.1 million in August 2000. These equity purchases were in
addition to a purchase by Procter & Gamble of
$10.0 million of our common stock that was completed in
March 1997. Procter & Gamble also agreed to provide funding
in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration,
of which we received $59.1 million through December 31,
2001. Beginning in September 1997, Procter & Gamble also
provided research support for our AXOKINE program, which ended
during the third quarter of 1999. As a result, Procter &
Gamble will be entitled to receive a small royalty on any sales
of AXOKINE.

In August 2000, Procter & Gamble made two
non-recurring research progress payments to us totaling
$3.5 million. Effective December 31, 2000, we and
Procter & Gamble entered into a new long-term collaboration
agreement, replacing the companies’ 1997 agreement. The new
agreement extends Procter & Gamble’s obligation to fund
our research under the new collaboration agreement through
December 2005, with no further research obligations by either
party thereafter, and focuses the companies’ collaborative
research on therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to
Procter & Gamble, including muscle atrophy and muscle
diseases, fibrotic diseases, and selected G-Protein Coupled
Receptors. For each of these program areas, the parties
contribute research activities and necessary intellectual
property rights pursuant to mutually agreed upon plans and
budgets established by operating committees. During the first
five years of the agreement, neither party will independently
perform research on targets included in the collaboration.

We and Procter & Gamble divided rights to the
programs from the 1997 collaboration agreement that are no
longer part of the companies’ collaboration. Procter &
Gamble obtained rights to certain early stage programs. We have
rights to all other research programs including exclusive rights
to the VEGF Trap, the Angiopoietins, and Regeneron’s Orphan
Receptors (RORs). Any drugs that result from the new
collaboration will continue to be jointly developed and marketed
worldwide, with the companies equally sharing development costs
and profits. Under the new agreement, beginning in the first
quarter of 2001, research support from Procter & Gamble is
$2.5 million per quarter (before adjustments for inflation)
through December 2005.

The new collaboration agreement will expire on
the later of December 31, 2005 or the termination of
research, development, or commercial activities relating to
compounds that meet predefined success criteria before that
date. In addition, if either party successfully develops a
compound covered under the agreement to a predefined development
stage during the two-year period following December 31,
2005, the parties shall meet to determine whether to reconvene
joint development of the compound under the agreement. The
agreement is also subject to termination if either party enters
bankruptcy, breaches its material obligations, or undergoes a
change of control. In addition to termination rights, our new
collaboration agreement with Procter & Gamble has an
“opt-out” provision, whereby a party may decline to
participate further in a research or product development
program. In such cases, the opting-out party will generally not
have any further funding obligation and will not have any rights
to the product or program in question (but may be entitled to a
royalty on any product sales). If Procter & Gamble opts out
of a product development program, and we do not find a new
partner, we would bear the full cost of the program.



Medarex.

In March
2000, we entered into a collaboration under a binding memorandum
of understanding with Medarex to discover, develop, and
commercialize human antibodies as therapeutics. We contribute
our expertise in discovering and characterizing proteins as drug
targets, and Medarex contributes its HuMAb-Mouse™
technology to create fully human antibody products for those
targets. We and Medarex prioritize targets based upon a variety
of criteria, including target validation, reagent availability,
market opportunity, competitive factors, intellectual property
position, and the expected feasibility of obtaining antibodies
that have the desired properties. The HuMAb-Mouse is a
transgenic mouse whose genes for creating mouse antibodies have
been inactivated and replaced by human antibody genes. This
makes it possible to rapidly create and develop fully human
antibodies as drug candidates.

Under the agreement, Medarex and we will share
all development, manufacturing, and clinical costs of jointly
developed products and all net profits and losses. Each of us
has the right to opt out of the joint development of the antigen
target and receive instead certain milestones and royalty
payments on net sales. The agreement terminates upon the earlier
of three years or the date on which neither party is exploiting
any jointly developed products. The agreement is also subject to
termination if either party enters bankruptcy or breaches its
material obligations thereunder.

Emisphere.

In March
2000, we signed an agreement with Emisphere Technologies, Inc.
to establish a research and development collaboration to utilize
Emisphere’s oral drug delivery technology for AXOKINE. In
preliminary preclinical pharmacokinetic studies, the Emisphere
technology was able to achieve measurable blood levels of
AXOKINE. Under the terms of the agreement, we will support
research at Emisphere and make license and milestone payments
based on the satisfaction of pre-determined criteria during the
development of orally delivered AXOKINE. The parties established
a steering committee to determine these milestones, which
trigger either payment obligations or termination rights for
either party. The first of these milestones is based on the
status of the program as of May 31, 2002. The steering
committee meets on at least a quarterly basis to review the
results of the program. In addition, the agreement is subject to
termination if either party breaches its material obligations
thereunder. During the term of the agreement, we will receive
exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to oral products
that result from the collaboration and pay Emisphere a royalty
on sales of any such products.

Shearwater.

In
December 2000, we entered into a license and supply agreement
with Shearwater Corporation, now a subsidiary of Inhale
Therapeutics Systems, Inc., under which Shearwater will develop
and supply a pegylated reagent that could be used to formulate a
modified form of AXOKINE. In preclinical studies, a pegylated
AXOKINE was substantially longer lasting than unmodified
AXOKINE. This may allow less frequent and/or lower dosing in
patients. Under the terms of the agreement, Shearwater will
develop and supply the reagent and we will manufacture and have
exclusive rights to pegylated AXOKINE. Shearwater is entitled to
receive milestone payments based on the development of the
modified AXOKINE and will be the exclusive supplier of the
reagent. We will pay Shearwater a royalty not to exceed 2.5% on
sales of any pegylated AXOKINE. The agreement remains in force
until the later of ten years from the grant of the first
marketing approval for a pegylated AXOKINE or the last to expire
patent covering Shearwater’s pegylated reagent. In
addition, each party shall have the right to terminate the
agreement upon bankruptcy of the other party or the other
party’s breach of a material obligation under the
agreement. We have additional termination rights if market or
other conditions, including regulatory restrictions, seriously
inhibit the ability to develop or market pegylated AXOKINE.

Amgen.

Amgen-Regeneron Partners has the
development rights to NT-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor, or BDNF, in the United States. We are required to fund
50% of the development costs of Amgen-Regeneron Partners to
maintain 50% of the commercialization rights. Assuming equal
capital contributions to Amgen-Regeneron Partners, we and Amgen
share any profits or losses of Amgen-Regeneron Partners equally.
Under our agreement with Amgen, we are attempting to develop
NT-3 with Amgen and, if such effort is successful,
commercialize, market, and distribute NT-3 in the United States
through Amgen-Regeneron Partners. Our agreement with Amgen will
continue for the longer of the life of the patents covering NT-3
or fifteen years from the date on which NT-3 is approved for
commercial marketing in any country. The agreement is also
subject to termination if either party enters bankruptcy or
breaches its material obligations thereunder. During the term of
the agreement, there are restrictions on the ability of either
party to



independently conduct research or development of
NT-3 without the other party. Our aggregate capital contribution
to Amgen-Regeneron Partners from the partnership’s
inception in June 1993 through December 31, 2001 was
$57.9 million. We do not expect to make capital
contributions to the partnership in 2002 since there are no
ongoing development activities for NT-3 at this time, but
additional contributions may be required, depending upon, among
other things, whether and how Amgen-Regeneron Partners proceeds
with the development of NT-3.

The development and commercialization of NT-3
outside of the United States, Japan, China, and certain other
Pacific Rim countries, if any, will be conducted solely by Amgen
through a license from us and from Takeda Chemical Industries,
Ltd. In return, we will receive royalty payments based on
Amgen’s net sales of any products in the licensed
territory. In the licensed territory, Amgen is solely
responsible for funding clinical development and related costs
of the licensed products, as well as costs of their commercial
exploitation, and has sole discretion with respect to all such
development, manufacturing, and marketing of the products and
sole responsibility for filing applications for regulatory
approvals.

Following a review of available clinical trial
data, we and Amgen discontinued the development of BDNF for the
treatment of ALS in January 2001.

Sumitomo.

In March
1989, Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd. entered into a Technology
Development Agreement with us and paid us $5.6 million. In
addition, Sumitomo Chemical purchased $4.4 million of our
equity. In connection with this agreement, we granted Sumitomo
Chemical a limited right of first negotiation, over a
fifteen-year period, to license up to three of our product
candidates to commercialize in Japan on financial and commercial
terms as we may offer. If Sumitomo Chemical decides it does not
wish to enter into a license agreement with us on the terms we
propose, we are free to license the product candidate to any
other third party in Japan on terms and conditions no more
favorable to a third party licensee than those offered to
Sumitomo Chemical. We are obligated periodically to inform and,
if requested, to meet with Sumitomo Chemical management about
our progress in research and development. This agreement will
expire on the earlier of March 20, 2004 or the date that
Sumitomo Chemical licenses three-product candidates from us,
provided that the parties may extend the agreement for an
additional five-year term.

BDNF is licensed to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals
Company, Ltd. (a subsidiary of Sumitomo Chemical) for
development in Japan. We recognized revenue from Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals related to BDNF of $0.2 million in 2001,
$7.6 million in 2000, and $0.1 million in 1999. In
light of the discontinuation of BDNF development for ALS, we do
not expect to receive further payments from Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals for research progress payments, contract
research and development, or contract manufacturing.

Manufacturing

We maintain an 8,000 square foot manufacturing
facility in Tarrytown, New York. This facility, which was
designed to comply with FDA current good manufacturing practices
(called GMP), produces preclinical and clinical supplies of our
product candidates.

In 1993, we purchased our 100,000 square foot
Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facility, which is being used
to manufacture drugs for our own preclinical and clinical
studies. We also use the facility to manufacture a product for
Merck & Co., Inc. under a long-term contract.

Currently, we dedicate approximately 230 people
to our manufacturing operations at these facilities.

In 1995, we entered into a long-term
manufacturing agreement with Merck (called, as amended, the
Merck Agreement) to produce an intermediate for a Merck
pediatric vaccine at our Rensselaer facility. We agreed to
modify portions of our facility for manufacture of the Merck
intermediate and to assist Merck in securing regulatory approval
for manufacturing in the Rensselaer facility. In December 1999,
we announced that the FDA had approved us as a contract
manufacturer for the Merck intermediate. Under the Merck
Agreement, we are manufacturing intermediate for Merck for six
years, with certain minimum order quantities each year. The
Merck Agreement is expected to extend to 2005 and may be
terminated at any time by Merck with prior notice. Merck agreed
to reimburse us for the capital costs to modify the facility and
for the cost of our activities performed on behalf of Merck
prior to the start of production. Merck also agreed to



pay an annual facility fee of $1.0 million,
subject to annual adjustment for inflation, reimburse us for
certain manufacturing costs, pay us a variable fee based on the
quantity of intermediate supplied to Merck, and make certain
additional payments. We recognized contract manufacturing
revenue related to the Merck Agreement of $9.8 million in
2001, $12.5 million in 2000, and $10.0 million in 1999.

Among the conditions for regulatory marketing
approval of a drug is the requirement that the prospective
manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures
conform to the GMP regulations of the health authority. In
complying with standards set forth in these regulations,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in
the area of production and quality control to ensure full
technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign
and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the
authority of the FDA and by other federal, state, and local
agencies. If our manufacturing facilities fail to comply with
FDA and other regulatory requirements, we will be required to
suspend manufacturing. This will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.

Competition

There is substantial competition in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and chemical companies. Our competitors may
include Hoffmann-LaRoche, Abbott Laboratories, Merck, Amgen, and
others. Many of our competitors have substantially greater
research, preclinical, and clinical product development and
manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human
resources than we do. Our smaller competitors may also be
significant if they acquire or discover patentable inventions,
form collaborative arrangements, or merge with large
pharmaceutical companies. Even if we achieve product
commercialization, one or more of our competitors may achieve
product commercialization earlier than we do or obtain patent
protection that dominates or adversely affects our activities.
Our ability to compete will depend on how fast we can develop
safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing
and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the
product to the market. Competition among product candidates
approved for sale will also be based on efficacy, safety,
reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other
factors.

AXOKINE

: There is
substantial competition in the discovery and development of
treatments for obesity, as well as established, cost-effective,
and emerging prescription and over-the-counter treatments for
this condition. For example, Hoffmann-LaRoche and Abbott
Laboratories already market well-established drugs for the
treatment of obesity and Amgen and a number of other
pharmaceutical companies are developing leptin and related
molecules. Clinical trials of leptin are under way. Some of
these drugs may offer competitive advantages over AXOKINE. For
example, AXOKINE currently is available only in injectible form,
while the currently available marketed drugs for the treatment
of obesity are delivered in oral dosage forms, which generally
are favored by patients over injectible drugs. Therefore, even
if AXOKINE is approved for sale, the fact that it must be
delivered by injection may severely limit its market acceptance
among patients and physicians.

Cytokine Traps

:
Similarly, marketed products for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis and asthma are available as either oral or inhaled
drugs, whereas our Cytokine Traps currently are only planned for
clinical trials as injectibles. The markets for both rheumatoid
arthritis and asthma are very competitive. Several new, highly
successful drugs recently became available for these disease
states. Examples include the TNF-antagonists Enbrel® (a
registered trademark of Immunex Corporation) and Remicade®
(a registered trademark of Centocor) and the IL1 receptor
antagonist Kineret® (a registered trademark of Amgen) for
rheumatoid arthritis, and the leukotriene-modifier
Singulair® (a registered trademark of Merck), as well as
various inexpensive corticosteroid drugs, for asthma.

VEGF Trap

: Many
companies are developing drugs designed to block the actions of
VEGF specifically and angiogenesis in general. A variety of
approaches have been employed, including antibodies to VEGF,
antibodies to the VEGF receptor, small molecule antagonists to
the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, as well as multiple other
anti-angiogenesis strategies. Many of these alternative
approaches may offer competitive advantages to our VEGF Trap in
efficacy, side-effect profile, or form of delivery.
Additionally, many of these



developmental drugs may be at a more advanced
stage of development than our product candidate. For example,
Genentech, Inc. is developing an antibody to VEGF that is
currently in Phase III clinical testing.

Other Areas

: Many
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to
discover and develop small-molecule based therapeutics, similar
in at least certain respects to our program with Procter &
Gamble. In these and related areas, intellectual property rights
have been sought and certain rights have been granted to
competitors and potential competitors of ours, and we may be at
a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result
of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained
personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic
competitors are involved in the discovery and development of
novel therapeutics using tyrosine kinase receptors, orphan
receptors, and compounds that are the focus of other research or
development programs we are now conducting. These competitors
include Amgen and Genentech, as well as many others. Many firms
and entities are engaged in research and development in the
areas of cytokines, interleukins, angiogenesis, and muscle
conditions. Some of these competitors are currently conducting
advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these
areas. These and other competitors may have established
substantial intellectual property and other competitive
advantages.

If a competitor announces a successful clinical
study involving a product that may be competitive with one of
our product candidates or an approval by a regulatory agency of
the marketing of a competitive product, such announcement may
have a material adverse effect on our operations, or future
prospects, or the price of our common stock.

We also compete with academic institutions,
governmental agencies, and other public or private research
organizations, which conduct research, seek patent protection,
and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and
marketing of products that would provide royalties for use of
their technology. These institutions are becoming more active in
seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect
royalties for use of the technology that they have developed.
Products developed in this manner may compete directly with
products we develop. We also compete with others in acquiring
technology from such institutions, agencies, and organizations.

Patents, Trademarks and Trade
Secrets

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to
obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate
without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.
Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology,
inventions, and improvements that are considered important to
the development of our business. We have been granted 66 U.S.
patents and we have approximately 100 pending applications. We
are the exclusive or nonexclusive licensee of a number of
additional U.S. patents and patent applications. We also rely
upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological
innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We
or our licensors or collaborators have filed patent applications
on products and processes relating to AXOKINE, Cytokine Traps,
VEGF Trap, Angiopoietins, and NT-3, as well as other
technologies and inventions in the United States and in certain
foreign countries. We intend to file additional patent
applications, when appropriate, relating to improvements in
these technologies and other specific products and processes. We
plan to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents
and other proprietary technology.

In September 2000, Immunex Corporation filed a
request with the European Patent Office seeking the declaration
of an Opposition regarding our European patent relating to
Cytokine Traps. This is a legal challenge to the validity and
scope of our patent. Although we plan to defend the patent
diligently, the scope of the patent may be adversely affected
pending the outcome of the Opposition.

Other parties could allege to have blocking
patent rights to our Traps in clinical development. Although we
do not believe our Traps infringe these patents, the third
parties with rights to these patents could initiate litigation
that has the potential to interfere with our ability to develop,
manufacture, or sell our clinical candidates, which would
severely harm our business.



We seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in
our judgment, such licenses are needed. If any licenses are
required, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain
any such license would severely harm our business.

Patent law relating to the patentability and
scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our
patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty. Others
may independently develop similar products or processes to those
developed by us, duplicate any of our products or processes or,
if patents are issued to us, design around any products and
processes covered by our patents. We expect to continue to file
product and process patent applications with respect to our
inventions. However, we cannot assure you that we will file any
such applications or, if filed, that the patents will be issued.
Patents issued to or licensed by us may be infringed by the
products or processes of others.

Defense and enforcement of our intellectual
property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the
outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued
to or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a
court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of
third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the
development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into
account patent rights of third parties.

Government Regulation

Regulation by government authorities in the
United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in
the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of our
product candidates. All of our product candidates will require
regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In
particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous
preclinical and clinical trials and other premarket approval
requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of
the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign
pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during
recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a
number of forums. The ultimate outcome and impact of such
reforms and potential reforms cannot be reasonably predicted.

Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with
certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of
the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the
efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be
submitted to the FDA. The phases of clinical studies may
overlap. The designation of a clinical trial as being of a
particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial
will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular
phase, and a clinical trial may contain elements of more than
one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being
of a particular phase. We cannot assure you that the results of
preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials will predict
long-term safety or efficacy of our compounds when they are
tested or used more broadly in humans. Various federal and state
statutes and regulations also govern or influence the research,
manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping,
marketing, transport, or other aspects of such products. The
lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the compliance
with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure
of substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators
or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory
approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products
and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue.

In addition to the foregoing, our present and
future business will be subject to regulation under the United
States Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, and the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, national restrictions, and other present and
potential future local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, we had 575
full-time employees, 105 of whom held a Ph.D. or M.D. degree or
both. We believe that we have been successful in attracting
skilled and experienced personnel in a highly competitive
environment; however, competition for these personnel is
intense. None of our personnel are covered by collective
bargaining agreements and our management considers its relations
with our employees to be good.



Item 2.

Properties

We conduct our research, development,
manufacturing, and administrative activities at our own
facilities. We currently lease approximately 171,000 square
feet, and sublease approximately 9,000 square feet, of
office, laboratory, and manufacturing space in Tarrytown, New
York. The current monthly base rental charge is $309,175 plus
additional rental charges for utilities, taxes, and operating
expenses, as defined. The lease and sublease expire on
June 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and
we have renewal options to extend the agreements for an
additional five-year period. We own the Rensselaer facility,
consisting of two buildings totaling approximately
104,000 square feet of research, manufacturing, office, and
warehouse space.

In 2002, we expect to lease additional space in
both our Tarrytown and Rensselaer locations, and incur
approximately $50 million in capital expenditures for our
expanded manufacturing and research and development activities.
In the future, we may locate, lease, operate, or purchase
additional facilities in which to conduct expanded research and
development activities and manufacturing and commercial
operations.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

In September 2000, Immunex Corporation filed a
request with the European Patent Office seeking the declaration
of an Opposition regarding the scope of our European patent
relating to Cytokine Traps. This is a legal challenge to the
validity and scope of our patent. Although we plan to defend the
patent diligently, the scope of the patent may be adversely
affected pending the outcome of the Opposition. In addition to
this patent challenge, we have from time to time been subject to
legal claims arising in connection with our business. While the
ultimate results of the patent challenge and legal claims cannot
be predicted with certainty, at December 31, 2001, there
were no asserted claims against us which, in the opinion of
management, if adversely decided, would have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Item 4.

Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

General

We are a biopharmaceutical company that
discovers, develops, and intends to commercialize therapeutic
drugs for the treatment of serious medical conditions. Our
product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment
of obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory
conditions, cancer and related disorders, allergies, asthma, and
other diseases and disorders. Since inception we have not
generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any
of our product candidates.

Below is a summary of our leading clinical
programs, as well as product candidates that are expected to
enter clinical trials over the next year. We retain sole
ownership and marketing rights for each of these programs and
currently are developing them independent of any corporate
partners.



•

VEGF TRAP:

Protein-based antagonist to Vascular
	Endothelial Growth Factor (called VEGF, also known as Vascular
	Permeability Factor or VPF). VEGF is required for the growth of
	blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent
	regulator of vascular permeability and leak. In November 2001,
	we initiated a Phase I clinical trial designed to assess
	the safety and tolerability of VEGF Trap in patients with solid
	tumor malignancies and patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

•

ANGIOPOIETINS:

A new
	family of growth factors that act specifically on the
	endothelium cells that line blood vessels. Angiopoietins may be
	useful for growing blood vessels in diseased hearts and other
	tissues with decreased blood flow and for repairing blood vessel
	leaks that cause swelling and edema in many different diseases
	such as stroke, diabetic retinopathy, and inflammatory diseases.
	Selected Angiopoietins, including engineered forms of these
	growth factors, are in preclinical development.

In addition to the above programs which we are
conducting independent of any corporate partners, we have formed
collaborations to advance other research and development
efforts. We are conducting research with Procter & Gamble in
muscle diseases and other fields. We are also collaborating with
Medarex to discover, develop, and commercialize certain human
antibodies as therapeutics. In partnership with Amgen, we have
development rights to Neurotrophin-3, or NT-3, a clinical
compound for the treatment of constipating conditions, although
there are no ongoing development activities for NT-3 at this
time. In all of these research collaborations, we retain 50% of
the commercialization rights.

We have not received revenue from the
commercialization of our product candidates and may never
receive such revenues. Before revenues from the
commercialization of our product candidates can be realized, we
(or our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which
include successfully completing our research and development
efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA or
regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving
and highly competitive, and new developments may render our
products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete.

From inception on January 8, 1988 through
December 31, 2001, we had a cumulative loss of
$299.7 million. In the absence of revenues from the
commercialization of our product candidates or other sources,
the amount, timing, nature, or source of which cannot be
predicted, our losses will continue as we conduct our research
and development activities. Our activities may expand over time
and may require additional resources and we expect our operating
losses to be substantial over at least the next several years.
Our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will
depend, among other factors, on the timing of certain expenses
and on the progress of our research and development efforts.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Our total revenue decreased to
$22.0 million in 2001 from $59.3 million in 2000.
Contract research and development revenue decreased to
$12.1 million in 2001 from $36.5 million in 2000.
Under our long-term collaboration agreement with Procter &
Gamble, research payments decreased effective in the first
quarter of 2001 to $2.5 million per quarter (before adjustments
for inflation) from $7.1 million per quarter for the first
two quarters of 2000 and $6.8 million per quarter for last
two quarters of 2000. In addition, revenue from Amgen-Regeneron
Partners decreased to $1.2 million in 2001 from
$6.2 million in 2000 due to the cessation of clinical trial
activity on brain derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, in
January 2001 and the substantial completion of our Phase II
studies of NT-3. In 2000, research progress payments consisted
of two non-recurring payments totaling $3.5 million from
Procter & Gamble related to our long-term collaboration
agreement and a non-recurring payment of $3.0 million
(reduced by $0.3 million of Japanese withholding tax) from
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals related to the development of BDNF in
Japan. Contract manufacturing revenue decreased to
$9.9 million in 2001, compared to $16.6 million in
2000. Contract manufacturing revenue related to our long-term
agreement with Merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at
our Rensselaer, New York facility decreased to $9.8 million
in 2001 from $12.5 million in 2000, primarily because
intermediate manufactured in the second half of 2001 will not be
shipped to Merck until 2002. Revenue and the related
manufacturing expense will be recognized as the product is
shipped, after acceptance by Merck. Contract manufacturing
revenue in 2000 also included $4.1 million related to the
manufacture of clinical supplies of BDNF for Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals in



connection with a research and development
agreement. Production of BDNF clinical supplies for Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals was discontinued in January 2001.

Our total operating expenses increased to
$107.7 million in 2001 from $84.6 million in 2000.
Research and development expenses increased to $91.5 million in
2001 from $60.6 million in 2000, primarily as a result of
higher staffing and increased activity in our preclinical and
clinical development programs. This increased activity relates,
in part, to the initiation of a Phase III clinical program
of AXOKINE in July 2001 and a Phase I study of the IL1 Trap
in December 2000. Research and development expenses were 85% of
total operating expenses in 2001, compared to 72% in 2000.
Contract manufacturing expenses decreased to $6.5 million
in 2001 from $15.6 million in 2000. In addition to the
above-described effect of not shipping vaccine intermediate
manufactured for Merck in the second half of 2001 until 2002,
the decrease was due, in part, to higher costs in 2000
associated with initiating commercial production at our
Rensselaer facility of both intermediate for Merck and BDNF for
clinical use by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals. General and
administrative expenses increased to $9.6 million in 2001
from $8.4 million in 2000, due primarily to higher
administrative staffing to support a larger and more diversified
company.

Investment income in 2001 increased to
$13.2 million from $8.5 million in 2000 due primarily
to interest earned on the net proceeds of $192.7 million
from our private placement of $200 million aggregate
principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in
October 2001 and $156.7 million from our public offering in
March and April 2001. The loss in Amgen-Regeneron Partners
decreased to $1.0 million in 2001 from $4.6 million in
2000 due to the partnership’s cessation of clinical trial
activity on BDNF in January 2001 and the substantial completion
of Phase II studies of NT-3. Interest expense increased to
$2.7 million in 2001 from $0.3 million in 2000 due to
interest incurred on the convertible notes issued in October
2001. These notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum, payable
semi-annually.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, we changed our
method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform with the
guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

,
(SAB 101), effective as of January 1, 2000. The
cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 as of January 1,
2000 was to increase our net loss by $1.6 million, or $0.04
per share, with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue
that is being recognized in subsequent periods. The SAB 101
adjustment relates to a portion of a 1989 payment received from
Sumitomo Chemical in consideration for a fifteen year limited
right of first negotiation to license up to three of our product
candidates in Japan. In 2001 and 2000, we recognized contract
research and development revenue of $0.4 million per year
that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of
January 1, 2000.

Our net loss in 2001 was $76.2 million, or
$1.81 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of
$23.2 million, or $0.66 per share (basic and diluted), in
2000.

Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.

Our total revenue increased to
$59.3 million in 2000 from $34.5 million in 1999.
Contract research and development revenue increased to
$36.5 million in 2000 from $24.5 million in 1999.
Contract research and development revenue from Procter &
Gamble increased to $28.3 million in 2000 from
$20.8 million in 1999 as increased revenue under the
companies’ collaboration agreement more than offset the
termination of Procter & Gamble payments related to
AXOKINE research in the third quarter of 1999 after Procter
& Gamble returned the product rights to AXOKINE to us.
Revenue from Amgen-Regeneron Partners increased to
$6.2 million in 2000 from $3.6 million in 1999 due to
increased clinical trial activity on BDNF and NT-3. In 2000,
research progress payments consisted of two non-recurring
payments totaling $3.5 million from Procter & Gamble
related to our long-term collaboration agreement and a
non-recurring payment of $3.0 million (reduced by
$0.3 million of Japanese withholding tax) from Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals related to the development of BDNF in Japan.
Contract manufacturing revenue increased to $16.6 million
in 2000, compared to $10.0 million in 1999. Contract
manufacturing revenue related to our long-term agreement with
Merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate increased to
$12.5 million in 2000 from $10.0 million in 1999. In
1999, Merck revenue was primarily compensation for services
rendered related to preparing for commercial production, which
began in the fourth quarter of 1999. In 2000, Merck revenue
primarily consisted of payments related to commercial
production. In addition, contract manufacturing



revenue in 2000 included $4.1 million
related to the manufacture of clinical supplies of BDNF for
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in connection with a research and
development agreement.

Our total operating expenses increased to
$84.6 million in 2000 from $58.3 million in 1999. Research
and development expenses increased to $60.6 million in 2000
from $48.3 million in 1999, primarily as a result of higher
staffing and increased activity in our preclinical and clinical
research programs. Research and development expenses were 72% of
total operating expenses in 2000, compared to 83% in 1999.
General and administrative expenses increased to $8.4 million in
2000 from $6.4 million in 1999 due to higher administrative
staffing and related occupancy costs, and an increase in patent
expenses related primarily to our acquiring the patent rights to
CNTF from Amgen. Contract manufacturing expenses increased to
$15.6 million in 2000 from $3.6 million in 1999 due
primarily to costs associated with initiating commercial
production at our Rensselaer facility of both a vaccine
intermediate for Merck and clinical supplies of BDNF for
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals.

Investment income in 2000 increased to
$8.5 million from $5.2 million in 1999 due to interest
earned on the proceeds of our public offering in April 2000 and
our sale of Common Stock to Procter & Gamble in August 2000.
The loss in Amgen-Regeneron Partners increased to
$4.6 million in 2000 from $4.2 million in 1999 as a
result of the partnership’s increased clinical trial
activity on BDNF and NT-3. Interest expense was
$0.3 million in both 2000 and 1999.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, we changed our
method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform with the
guidance provided by SAB 101, effective as of January 1, 2000.
The cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 as of January 1, 2000
was to increase our net loss by $1.6 million, or $0.04 per
share, with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue that is
being recognized in subsequent periods. The SAB 101 adjustment
relates to a portion of a 1989 payment received from Sumitomo
Chemical in consideration for a fifteen year limited right of
first negotiation to license up to three of our product
candidates in Japan. In 2000, we recognized contract research
and development revenue of $0.4 million per year that was
included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1,
2000.

Our net loss in 2000 was $23.2 million, or
$0.66 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of
$23.1 million, or $0.74 per share (basic and diluted), in
1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our
operations primarily through private placements and public
offerings of our equity securities, a private placement of
convertible debt, revenue earned under our agreements with
Amgen, Sumitomo Chemical, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, Merck, and
Procter & Gamble, and investment income.

In May 1997, we entered into a long-term
collaboration agreement with Procter and Gamble. In connection
with the collaboration, Procter & Gamble made equity
purchases in Regeneron of $42.9 million in June 1997 and
$17.1 million in August 2000, and agreed to provide funding
in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration,
of which we have received $59.1 million through
December 31, 2001. In August 2000, Procter &
Gamble made two non-recurring research progress payments to us
totaling $3.5 million.

Effective December 31, 2000, we and Procter
& Gamble entered into a new long-term collaboration
agreement, replacing the companies’ 1997 agreement. The new
agreement extends Procter & Gamble’s obligation to
fund Regeneron’s research through December 2005, with no
further research obligations by either party thereafter, and
focuses the companies’ collaborative research on
therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to Procter
& Gamble. Under the new agreement, beginning in the first
quarter of 2001, research support from Procter & Gamble is
$2.5 million per quarter, before adjustments for inflation,
through December 2005.

Our activities relating to NT-3, as agreed upon
by Amgen and us, are being compensated by Amgen-Regeneron
Partners for services rendered, and we recognize these amounts
as revenue. In January 2001, Amgen-Regeneron Partners
discontinued all development of BDNF for the potential treatment
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We and Amgen fund
Amgen-Regeneron Partners through capital contribu-



tions. We expect to continue funding 50% of the
development costs of the partnership in order to maintain equal
ownership and equal sharing of the profits or losses of the
partnership. Our aggregate capital contribution to
Amgen-Regeneron Partners from the partnership’s inception
in June 1993 through December 31, 2001 was
$57.9 million. We do not expect to make capital
contributions to the partnership in 2002 since there are no
ongoing development activities for NT-3 at this time, but
additional contributions may be required, depending upon, among
other things, whether and how Amgen-Regeneron Partners proceeds
with the development of NT-3.

In connection with our agreement to collaborate
with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in the research and development of
BDNF in Japan, we received a research progress payment from
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals of $3.0 million (reduced by
$0.3 million Japanese withholding tax) in April 2000. In
addition, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals has paid us
$32.0 million through December 31, 2001 in connection
with supplying BDNF for preclinical and clinical use. In light
of the discontinuation of BDNF development for ALS, we do not
expect to receive further payments from Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals
for research progress payments, contract research and
development, or contract manufacturing.

In April 2000, we completed a public offering of
2.6 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $29.75 per
share and received proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of
$72.9 million. In August 2000, we sold 573,630 shares of
Common Stock to Procter & Gamble at a price of $29.75
per share and received total proceeds of $17.1 million. The
sale of stock to Procter & Gamble was made pursuant to
a 1997 securities purchase agreement. In March 2001, we
completed a public offering in which we issued 6.5 million
shares of Common Stock at a price of $25.00 per share and
received proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of
$153.6 million. In April 2001, we sold an additional
130,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
underwriters’ over-allotment option from the March 2001
public offering at a price of $25.00 per share and received
proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of $3.1 million.

In October 2001, we issued $200.0 million
aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated
notes in a private placement and received proceeds, after
deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and
out-of-pocket expenses, of $192.7 million. The notes bear
interest at 5.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in
2008. The notes are convertible into shares of our Common Stock
at a conversion price of approximately $30.25 per share, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances. We may redeem the notes,
in whole or in part, at any time before October 17, 2004,
if the closing price of our Common Stock has exceeded 150% of
the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of
time. Upon any such redemption, we are required to pay interest
that would have been due up through October 17, 2004. We
may also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after
October 17, 2004, if the closing price of our Common Stock
has exceeded 140% of the conversion price then in effect for a
specified period of time. We pledged $31.6 million of U.S.
government securities which will be sufficient upon receipt of
scheduled principal and interest payments to provide for the
payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on
the notes when due.

Our total expenses for research and development
from inception through December 31, 2001 have been
approximately $460 million. We have not historically
segregated all the costs associated with each of our research
programs and it is not possible to forecast their success or the
amounts that we may spend in the future. We currently have
research collaboration agreements with Procter & Gamble,
Medarex, Emisphere Technologies, Inc., Amgen, and Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals. In 2001, 2000, and 1999, total expenses for
research programs conducted under our third-party collaboration
agreements (which also include contract manufacturing expenses
incurred prior to commencing commercial production of products
for Merck and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals) were approximately $12
million, $31 million, and $37 million, respectively. The
remainder of our research and development expenses in those
years related to our own internal research programs. We are
currently only committed to incur research expenditures under
our research collaboration agreements through the end of 2005
and estimate that, based on current plans, such expenditures
will total less than $50 million.

At December 31, 2001, we had
$438.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities, and restricted marketable securities. We have no
off-balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the
obligations of any other entity. As of December 31, 2001,
we had no established banking arrangements



through which we could obtain short-term
financing or a line of credit. We may seek additional funding
through, among other things, future collaboration agreements and
public or private financing. We cannot assure you that
additional financing will be available to us or, if available,
that it will be available on acceptable terms.

Our additions to property, plant, and equipment
totaled $9.5 million in 2001, $6.5 million in 2000,
and $5.9 million in 1999. We also leased an additional
$1.1 million of equipment in 1999. In connection with the
purchase and renovation of our Rensselaer facility, we obtained
financing of $2.0 million from the New York State Urban
Development Corporation. The outstanding balance on this note of
$1.5 million was fully repaid in October 2001.

We expect to incur substantial funding
requirements for, among other things, research and development
activities (including preclinical and clinical testing),
expansion and validation of manufacturing facilities, and the
acquisition of equipment. We anticipate that expenses for basic
research and clinical development will increase in 2002 by more
than 30% over 2001 amounts. We currently anticipate that in
2002, approximately 50-70% of our expenditures will be directed
toward the preclinical and clinical development of product
candidates, including AXOKINE, pegylated AXOKINE, IL1 Trap,
IL4/13 Trap, VEGF Trap, and the angiopoietins; approximately
5-15% of our expenditures will be invested in expansion of our
manufacturing facilities; approximately 10-30% will cover our
basic research activities; approximately 5-15% of our
expenditures will be directed toward the continued development
of our novel technology platforms, including potential efforts
to commercialize these technologies; and the remainder of our
expenditures will be for general corporate purposes, including
working capital. In 2002, we expect to lease additional space in
both our Tarrytown and Rensselaer locations and incur
approximately $50 million in capital expenditures for our
expanded manufacturing and research and development activities.

In connection with our funding requirements, the
following table summarizes our contractual obligations for
future lease and long-term debt payments.

(1)

Includes amounts representing interest.

(2)

Excludes future contingent rental costs for
	utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. In 2001,
	these costs were $3.0 million.

We expect that expenses related to the filing,
prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patent and other
intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as
a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the United States
and foreign countries.

The amount we need to fund operations will depend
on various factors, including the status of competitive
products, the success of our research and development programs,
the potential future need to expand our professional and support
staff and facilities, the status of patents and other
intellectual property rights, the delay or failure of a clinical
trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the
continuation, extent, and success of any collaborative research
arrangements (including those with Procter & Gamble,
Medarex, Emisphere, and Amgen). Clinical trial costs are
dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of
trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial
investigators and other third parties, the costs for
manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials,
supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of
funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends
upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and
early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the
clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we
decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the
costs of each trial as described above. We believe that our
existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating
needs through at least 2003. However, this is a forward-looking
statement based on our current operating plan, and we cannot



assure you that there will be no change in
projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital
being consumed significantly before such time. If there is
insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and
activities, we believe we would prioritize available capital to
fund preclinical and clinical development of our product
candidates.

Critical Accounting Policies

We recognize revenue from contract research and
development and research progress payments as we perform
services, provided a contractual arrangement exists, the
contract price is fixed or determinable, and our collection of
the resulting receivable is probable. In situations where we
receive payment in advance of the performance of services, these
amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as we perform the
related services. Non-refundable fees, including payments we
receive for services, up-front licensing fees, technology fees,
and research progress payments, are recognized as revenue based
on the percentage of costs incurred to date, estimated costs to
complete, and total expected contract revenue. However, the
revenue we recognize is limited to the amount of non-refundable
fees received. Non-refundable fees that we receive in
consideration for granting collaborators the right to license
product candidates developed by us are recognized as revenue on
a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying
agreements. This policy conforms with guidance provided by
SAB 101. With regard to our revenues from non-refundable
fees, changes in our assumptions of estimated costs to complete
could have a material impact on the revenues we recognize.

We have entered into a contract manufacturing
agreement with Merck under which we manufacture a vaccine
intermediate at our Rensselaer, New York facility and perform
services. We recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this
agreement after the product is tested and approved by, and
shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck, and as services are
performed. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to modify
portions of our Rensselaer facility to manufacture Merck’s
vaccine intermediate and Merck agreed to reimburse us for the
related capital costs. The value of those capital cost payments
was deferred and is recognized as revenue as product is approved
by and shipped to Merck. The rate at which revenue is recognized
is based upon our estimate of Merck’s order quantities each
year through the expected end of the agreement in 2005. Should
actual shipments differ from our estimates, the rate at which
this deferred revenue is recognized could change, but the total
remaining balance of $9.7 million at December 31, 2001
will be recognized in the 2002 to 2005 period. Since we
commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in November
1999, our estimates of Merck’s order quantities each year
have not been materially different from Merck’s actual
orders.

Research and development expenses include costs
directly attributable to the conduct of our research and
development, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
collaboration and licensing agreements, the cost of services
provided by outside contractors, including services related to
our clinical trials, clinical trial expenses, the full cost of
manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development,
and clinical trials, expenses related to the development of
manufacturing processes prior to commencing commercial
production of a product under contract manufacturing
arrangements, and the allocable portions of facility costs, such
as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance,
depreciation, and general support services. All costs associated
with research and development are expensed as incurred.

For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain
clinical trial costs, which are included in research and
development expenses, are expensed based on the expected total
number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients
enter the trial, and the period over which clinical
investigators and contract research organizations are expected
to provide services. We believe that this method best aligns the
expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical
trial. We adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if
actual results differ from our estimates.

our financial statements.

Factors That May Affect Future Operating
Results

We caution shareholders and potential investors
that the following important factors, among others, in some
cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual
results and could cause our actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by,
or on behalf of, us. The statements under this caption are
intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
following information is not intended to limit in any way the
characterization of other statements or information under other
captions as cautionary statements for such purpose:



As our scientific efforts lead to potentially
promising new directions, both outside of recombinant protein
therapies and into conditions or diseases outside of our current
areas of experience and expertise, we will require additional
internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which
we currently do not have substantial resources and personnel.

To date, we have received revenues from
(1) our licensees and collaborators for research and
development efforts, (2) Merck and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals
for contract manufacturing, and (3) investment income. We
may not continue to receive these revenues from our licensees,
collaborators, or contract manufacturing customers. In the
absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product
candidates or other sources, our losses will continue as we
conduct our research and development activities. Our activities
may expand over time and may require additional resources, and
our operating losses may be substantial over at least the next
several years. Our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter
and will depend, among other factors, on the timing of certain
expenses and on the progress of our research and development
efforts. We do not know if we will ever have an approved product
or achieve significant revenues or profitable operations. We do
not expect to receive any revenue from the commercialization of
our product candidates for several years and we intend to
continue to invest significantly in our research and development
activities. Even if we do successfully develop products that can
be marketed and sold commercially, we will need to generate
significant revenue from products to achieve and maintain
profitability.



During the conduct of clinical trials, patients
report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries
and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not
possible to determine whether or not these conditions are caused
by the drug being studied. Various illnesses, injuries, and
discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during the
clinical trials of AXOKINE, our only product candidate that has
completed Phase II trials. The most frequently reported
conditions during the AXOKINE Phase II trial were injection site
reactions, cough, and nausea or vomiting. During the Phase I
study that was conducted in 1999, some subjects developed mouth
sores, also known as cold sores, when AXOKINE was given in
higher doses than what is being studied in the Phase III
program. These cold sores were thought to be caused by the
reactivation of herpes simplex virus, or HSV. Recurrence of HSV
was also reported in previous clinical studies of CNTF,
AXOKINE’s parent molecule. In the Phase I AXOKINE study,
one patient who had evidence of previous exposure to HSV prior
to treatment and had been previously diagnosed with Bell’s
palsy, had a recurrence of Bell’s palsy approximately two
weeks after the patient’s last administration of AXOKINE.
In the ongoing Phase III study of AXOKINE, one patient was
reported to have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome
following an upper respiratory tract infection.

Although AXOKINE was generally well tolerated in
the completed Phase II trial, it is possible that as we test
AXOKINE in a large and extended Phase III program, illnesses,
injuries, and discomforts that were observed in the earlier
trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went
undetected in these smaller trials, will be reported by
patients. If additional clinical experience indicates that
AXOKINE has many side effects or causes serious or
life-threatening side effects, the development of AXOKINE may
fail or be delayed, which would severely harm our business.

Most drug research and development programs never
lead to the development of commercially successful products.
Only a small minority of all research and development programs
ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We are
attempting to develop drugs for human therapeutic uses, and our
research and development activities may not be successful and
none of our potential product candidates may ever complete
clinical trials. Even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and
efficacy of our product candidates and the necessary regulatory
approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any of our
product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by
patients, the medical community, and third-party payors and on
our ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market our
product candidates. If our products are not successfully
commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant
investment we have made in developing such products and our
business would be severely harmed.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are subject to
fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our
investment of available cash balances in investment grade
corporate and U.S. government securities. We do not believe we
are materially exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our
current policies we do not use interest rate derivative
instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:

In our opinion, based upon our audits and the
report of other auditors, the accompanying balance sheets and
the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
“Company”) at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of Amgen-Regeneron Partners (the
“Partnership”), an entity which is fifty percent owned
by the Company, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2001. The Company’s investment in the Partnership is
accounted for in accordance with the equity method of
accounting. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, its investment
constitutes less than one percent of the Company’s assets.
For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the
Company recorded its pro rata share of the Partnership’s
net loss of approximately $1.0 million, $4.6 million,
and $4.2 million, respectively. The Partnership’s
financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report
thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed
herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the
Partnership, is based solely on the report of the other
auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, during the year ended December 31, 2000, the
Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

1.     Organization
and Business

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
“Company” or “Regeneron”) was incorporated
in January 1988 in the State of New York. The Company is engaged
in research and development programs to discover and
commercialize therapeutics to treat human disorders and
conditions. The Company’s facilities are located in New
York. The Company’s business is subject to certain risks
including, but not limited to, uncertainties relating to
conducting pharmaceutical research, obtaining regulatory
approvals, commercializing products, and obtaining and enforcing
patents.

2.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Property,
Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the
useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred.
The cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets
retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and
any gain or loss is recognized in operations. The estimated
useful lives of property, plant, and equipment are as follows:

Building and improvements

6-30 years

Leasehold improvements

Life of lease

Laboratory and computer equipment

3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows and
the balance sheet, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount reported
in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates
its fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined based on standards that approximate
the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are shown net of
applicable reserves.

Revenue
Recognition and Change in Accounting Principle

a.

Contract Research and Development and
	Research Progress Payments

On January 1, 2000, the Company changed its
method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform with the
guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

(“SAB
101”). Effective January 1, 2000, the Company
recognizes revenue from contract research and development and
research progress payments as services are performed, provided a
contractual arrangement exists, the contract price is fixed or
determinable, and the collection of the resulting receivable is
probable. In situations where the Company receives payment in
advance of the performance of services, such amounts are
deferred and recognized as revenue as the related services are
performed. Gross profit margin on revenue from contract research
and development is immaterial. Non-refundable fees, including
payments for services, up-front licensing fees, technology fees,
and research progress payments (collectively,
“Non-refundable Fees”), are recognized as revenue
based on the percentage of costs incurred to date, estimated
costs to complete, and total expected contract revenue. However,
revenue recognized is limited to the amount of Non-refundable
Fees received. Non-refundable Fees received in consideration for
granting collaborators the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

right to license product candidates developed by
the Company are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis
over the term of the underlying agreements.

Prior to January 1, 2000, the Company
recognized revenue as described above, except that certain
Non-refundable Fees were recognized as revenue when there were
no additional contractual services to be provided or costs to be
incurred by the Company in connection with the Non-refundable
Fee.

The cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 at
January 1, 2000 amounted to $1.6 million of additional
loss, with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue that is
being recognized in subsequent periods, of which
$0.4 million was included in contract research and
development revenue in both 2001 and 2000. The $1.6 million
represents a portion of a 1989 payment received from Sumitomo
Chemical Co., Ltd. in consideration for a fifteen year limited
right of first negotiation to license up to three of the
Company’s product candidates in Japan (see Note 9b).
The effect of income taxes on the cumulative effect adjustment
was immaterial.

Prior period financial statements have not been
restated to apply SAB 101 retroactively; however, the pro forma
amounts included in the Statement of Operations show the net
loss and per share net loss assuming the Company had
retroactively applied SAB 101 to the prior period.

b.     Contract
Manufacturing

The Company has entered into contract
manufacturing agreements under which it manufactures products
and performs services for third parties. Contract manufacturing
revenue is recognized as products are shipped and as services
are performed (see Notes 9b and 10).

Investment
Income

Interest income, which is included in investment
income, is recognized as earned.

Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, are
reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Estimated
undiscounted expected future cash flows are used to determine if
an asset is impaired in which case the asset’s carrying
value would be reduced to fair value. For all periods presented,
no impairment losses were recorded.

Patents

As a result of the Company’s research and
development efforts, it has obtained, applied, or is applying
for numerous patents related to proprietary technology and
inventions. All costs associated with patents are expensed as
incurred.

Research and
Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs
directly attributable to the conduct of research and
development, including the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefits, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
maintenance of research equipment, costs related to research
collaboration and licensing agreements (see Note 8e), the
cost of services provided by outside contractors, including
services related to the Company’s clinical trials, clinical
trial expenses, the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in
research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, expenses
related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to
commencing commercial production of a product under contract
manufacturing arrangements, and the allocable portions of
facility costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and
maintenance, depreciation, and general support services. All
costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.

F-9


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

For each clinical trial that the Company
conducts, certain clinical trial costs, which are included in
research and development expenses, are expensed based on the
expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at
which patients enter the trial, and the period over which
clinical investigators and contract research organizations are
expected to provide services. The Company adjusts its rate of
clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from the
Company’s estimates.

Net Loss Per
Share

Net loss per share, basic and diluted, is
computed on the basis of the net loss for the period divided by
the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and
Class A Stock outstanding during the period. The diluted
net loss per share for all periods presented excludes the number
of shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible
debt and exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants,
since such inclusion would be antidilutive. Disclosures required
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share

, have been included in Note 15.

Income
Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets
are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial
reporting amounts (“temporary differences”) at enacted
tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for
deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain.

Comprehensive
Loss

Comprehensive loss represents the change in net
assets of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. Comprehensive loss of the Company includes net loss
adjusted for the change in net unrealized gain or loss on
marketable securities. The net effect of income taxes on
comprehensive loss is immaterial. Comprehensive losses for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 have been
included in the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted marketable
securities, and receivables from The Procter & Gamble
Company, Amgen-Regeneron Partners, and Merck & Co., Inc. The
Company generally invests its excess cash in obligations of the
U.S. government and its agencies, bank deposits, investment
grade debt securities issued by corporations, governments, and
financial institutions, and money market funds that invest in
these instruments. The Company has established guidelines that
relate to credit quality, diversification, and maturity, and
that limit exposure to any one issue of securities.

Risks and
Uncertainties

Regeneron has had no sales of its products and
there is no assurance that the Company’s research and
development efforts will be successful, that the Company will
ever have commercially approved products, or that the Company
will achieve significant sales of any such products. In January
2001, Amgen-Regeneron Partners, a partnership equally owned by
the Company and Amgen Inc., discontinued all clinical
development of one product following notification that the
product did not provide a therapeutic advantage to patients in
clinical trials (see Note 9a). The Company has incurred net
losses and negative cash flows from operations since its
inception, and revenues to date have been limited to payments
for research from four collaborators

and for contract manufacturing from two
pharmaceutical companies and investment income (see Notes 9
and 10). The Company operates in an environment of rapid
change in technology and is dependent upon the services of its
employees, consultants, collaborators, and certain third-party
suppliers of materials. Regeneron, as licensee, licenses certain
technologies that are important to the Company’s business
which impose various obligations on the Company. If Regeneron
fails to comply with these requirements, licensors may have the
right to terminate the Company’s licenses.

In September 2000, Immunex Corporation filed a
request with the European Patent Office seeking the declaration
of an opposition regarding the scope of the Company’s
European patent relating to Cytokine Traps. This is a legal
challenge to the validity and scope of the Company’s
patent. Although the Company plans to defend the patent
diligently, the scope of the patent may be adversely affected
pending the outcome of the opposition.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Stock-based
Employee Compensation

The accompanying financial position and results
of operations of the Company have been prepared in accordance
with APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

(“APB No. 25”). Under APB
No. 25, generally, no compensation expense is recognized in
the accompanying financial statements in connection with the
awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as
of the grant date, all terms associated with the award are fixed
and the quoted market price of the Company’s stock, as of
the grant date, is equal to or less than the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock as defined.

Disclosures required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”), including pro
forma operating results had the Company prepared its financial
statements in accordance with the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation, have been included in
Note 11.

Statement of
Cash Flows

Supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and
financing activities:

Capital lease obligations of $1.1 million
were incurred when the Company acquired new equipment in 1999.

In 2001 and 2000, the Company awarded 80,535 and
34,785 shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock under the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (see
Note 11a). The Company records unearned compensation in
Stockholders’ Equity related to these awards based on the
fair market value of shares of the Company’s Common Stock
on the grant date of the Restricted Stock award, which is
expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the two year period that the
restrictions on these shares lapse. In 2001, the Company
recognized $0.7 million of compensation expense related to
Restricted Stock Awards. No stock-based compensation expense was
recognized in 2000.

During January 1995, the Company issued 600,000
restricted shares of Common Stock (“Restricted
Shares”), in consideration for $0.3 million and
services to be rendered, in connection with an agreement with
the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The difference between
the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the
agreement was signed and the purchase price of the Restricted
Shares was $1.8 million which the Company recognized as
compensation expense on a pro rata basis over five years as the
restriction on the Restricted Shares lapsed.

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses
at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 were
$1.9 million, $0.7 million, and $0.7 million of
capital expenditures, respectively.

Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses
at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 were
$0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million,
respectively, of accrued 401(k) Savings Plan contribution
expense. During the first quarter of 2001, 2000, and 1999, the
Company contributed 17,484, 54,003, and 37,653 shares,
respectively, of Common Stock to the 401(k) Savings Plan in
satisfaction of these obligations.

Included in marketable securities at
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $2.0 million,
$2.3 million, and $1.2 million of accrued interest
income, respectively. Included in restricted marketable
securities at December 31, 2001 was $0.2 million of
accrued interest income.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the
financial statements for 2000 and 1999 to conform with the
current year’s presentation.

Effective in 2001, the Company’s financial
statement presentation of depreciation and amortization in the
Statement of Operations has been changed to allocate
depreciation and amortization between research and development
expense and general and administrative expense. Depreciation and
amortization related to contract manufacturing expense was
already included in contract manufacturing expense in 2000 and
1999. The effect of this reclassification for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 is presented in the following
table.

Future Impact
of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has
recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 141,

Business Combinations

,
SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,
SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Obligations Associated with
the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets

, and SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

, which the Company will be required to adopt in
future periods. Management believes that the future adoption of
these accounting standards will not have a material impact on
the Company’s financial statements.

3.     Marketable
Securities

The Company considers its unrestricted marketable
securities to be “available-for-sale,” as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses are
reported as a net amount in a separate component of
stockholders’ equity entitled Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss). The net change in unrealized
holding gains and losses is excluded from operations and
included in stockholders’ equity as a separate component of
comprehensive loss.

REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

The following tables summarize the amortized cost
basis of marketable securities, the aggregate fair value of
marketable securities, and gross unrealized holding gains and
losses at December 31, 2001 and 2000:

Realized gains and losses are included as a
component of investment income. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, gross realized gains and
losses were not significant. In computing realized gains and
losses, the Company computes the cost of its investments on a
specific identification basis. Such cost includes the direct
costs to acquire the securities, adjusted for the amortization
of any discount or premium. The fair value of marketable
securities has been estimated based on quoted market prices.

4.     Inventories

Inventory balances at December 31, 2001 and
2000 consist of raw materials, work-in process, and finished
products associated with the production of an intermediate for a
Merck & Co., Inc. pediatric vaccine under a long-term

7.     Stockholders’
Equity

The Company’s Amended Certificate of
Incorporation provides for the issuance of up to 40 million
shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and
160 million shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share. Shares of Class A Stock are convertible, at any
time, at the option of the holder into shares of Common Stock on
a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class A Stock have
rights and privileges identical to Common Stockholders except
that Class A Stockholders are entitled to ten votes per
share, while Common Stockholders are entitled to one vote per
share. Class A Stock may only be transferred to specified
Permitted Transferees, as defined. The Company’s Board of
Directors (the “Board”) is authorized to issue up to
30 million shares of preferred stock, in series, with
rights, privileges, and qualifications of each series determined
by the Board.

During January 1995, the Company entered into an
agreement with the Chairman of the Board. As partial
consideration for services to be rendered, the agreement
provided for the Company to sell the Chairman 600,000 restricted
shares of Common Stock (“Restricted Shares”), in
consideration for $0.3 million, and to grant 285,000 stock
options. The Restricted Shares were nontransferable with such
restriction lapsing ratably over a five-year period. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the
Company recognized compensation expense for the difference
between the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date
the agreement was signed and the purchase price of the
Restricted Shares on a pro rata basis over five years as the
restriction on the Restricted Shares lapsed. The unearned
compensation was fully amortized at December 31, 1999. For
the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company recognized
compensation expense of $0.4 million. The stock options,
which were issued under the Company’s Amended and Restated
1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan, entitle the holder to purchase an
equal number of shares of Common Stock at a per share price of
$3.50, the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of
grant. The options vested over a five-year period.

During 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan in which Rights were distributed as a dividend at
the rate of one Right for each share of Common Stock and
Class A Stock (collectively, “Stock”) held by
shareholders of record as of the close of business on
October 18, 1996. Each Right initially entitles the
registered holder to buy a unit (“Unit”) consisting of
one-one thousandth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (“A Preferred Stock”) at
a purchase price of $120 per Unit (the “Purchase
Price”). Initially the Rights were attached to all Stock
certificates representing shares then outstanding, and no
separate Rights certificates were distributed. The Rights will
separate from the Stock and a “distribution date” will
occur upon the earlier of (i) ten days after a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons, excluding certain defined persons, (an “Acquiring
Person”) has acquired, or has obtained the right to
acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Stock or (ii) ten business days following the
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would
result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of
such outstanding shares of Stock. The Rights are not exercisable
unless a distribution date occurs and will expire at the close
of business on October 18, 2006 unless earlier redeemed by
the Company, subject to certain defined restrictions, for $.01
per Right. In the event that an Acquiring Person becomes the
beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares
of Stock (unless such acquisition is made pursuant to a tender
or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of the Company, at
a price determined by a majority of the independent directors of
the Company who are not representatives, nominees, affiliates,
or associates of an Acquiring Person to be fair and otherwise in
the best interest of the Company and its shareholders after
receiving advice from one or more investment banking firms),
each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the
Right’s then current exercise price, common shares (or, in
certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the
Company) having a value twice the Right’s Exercise Price.
The Right’s Exercise Price is the Purchase Price times the
number of shares of Common Stock associated with each Right
(initially, one). Upon the occurrence of any such events, the
Rights held by an Acquiring Person become null and void. In
certain circumstances, a Right entitles the

F-15

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

holder to receive, upon exercise, shares of
common stock of an acquiring company having a value equal to two
times the Right’s Exercise Price.

As a result of the Shareholder Rights Plan, the
Company’s Board designated 100,000 shares of preferred
stock as A Preferred Stock. The A Preferred Stock has certain
preferences, as defined.

In April 2000, the Company completed a public
offering of 2.6 million shares of Common Stock at a price
of $29.75 per share for net proceeds, after commissions and
expenses, of $72.9 million. In March and April 2001, the
Company completed a public offering in which it issued
6.63 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $25.00
per share and received proceeds, after commissions and expenses,
of $156.7 million.

In March 2001, Medtronic, Inc. exercised 107,400
warrants with an exercise price of $21.72 per share on a
“cashless” basis and received 37,306 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock.

In October 2001, the Company completed a private
placement of $200 million aggregate principal amount of
senior subordinated notes, which are convertible into shares of
the Company’s Common Stock. See Note 8d.

8.     Commitments
and Contingencies

a.     Operating
Leases

The Company leases and subleases laboratory and
office space under operating lease agreements which expire
through June 30, 2003. The leases provide for base rent
plus additional rental charges for utilities, taxes, and
operating expenses, as defined. The Company has renewal options
to extend their leases for an additional five years.

The Company leases certain laboratory and office
equipment under operating leases which expire at various times
through 2006.

At December 31, 2001, the future minimum
noncancelable lease commitments under operating leases were as
follows:

Rent expense under operating leases was:

In addition to its rent expense for laboratory
and office space, the Company paid additional rental charges for
utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses of
$3.0 million, $2.1 million, and $1.0 million for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

b.     Capital
Leases

The Company leases equipment under noncancelable
capital leases. Lease terms are generally four years after
which, for certain leases, the Company may extend the lease for
eight additional months at defined monthly payments, or is
required to purchase the equipment at amounts defined by the
agreements.

As of December 31, 2001, minimum rental
payments under all capital leases, including payments to acquire
leased equipment, were as follows:

Leased equipment and building improvements
included in property, plant, and equipment was $1.6 million
and $2.4 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively; related accumulated depreciation was
$1.1 million and $1.4 million for the same respective
periods.

In connection with one capital lease, the Company
entered into a 38-month equipment maintenance agreement which
requires equal quarterly payments. The total amount due over the
remaining term of the agreement is $0.1 million.

c.     Note
Payable

In 1994, the Company borrowed $2.0 million
from the New York State Urban Development Corporation (“NYS
UDC”). The terms of the note provided for monthly payments
of principal and interest through December 2014. Outstanding
borrowings accrued interest at an effective interest rate of
approximately 6.4%. The note was collateralized by a first
mortgage on the Company’s land, building, and improvements
in Rensselaer, New York. In October 2001, the remaining
principal balance on this note of $1.5 million was paid in
full.

d.     Convertible
Debt

In October 2001, the Company issued
$200 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
senior subordinated notes (“Notes”) in a private
placement for proceeds to the Company, after deducting the
initial purchasers’ discount and out-of-pocket expenses, of
$192.7 million. The Notes bear interest at 5.5% per annum,
payable semi-annually, and mature on October 17, 2008. The
Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s Common
Stock at a conversion price of approximately $30.25 per share,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Regeneron may
redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time before
October 17, 2004 if the closing price of the Company’s
Common Stock has exceeded 150% of the conversion price then in
effect for a specified period of time (“Early
Redemption”). Upon any such Early Redemption, the Company
is required to pay interest that would have been due up through
October 17, 2004. Regeneron may also redeem some or all of the
Notes at any time on or after October 17, 2004 if the
closing price of the Company’s Common Stock has exceeded
140% of the conversion price then in effect for a specified
period of time. The estimated fair value of the Notes at
December 31, 2001 approximated their face value due to the
proximity to the Notes’ issuance date.

With respect to the Notes, the Company pledged as
collateral $31.6 million of U.S. government securities
(“Restricted Marketable Securities”) with maturities
at various dates through August 2004. Upon maturity, the
proceeds of the Restricted Marketable Securities will be
sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments on
the Notes when due. The Company considers its Restricted
Marketable Securities to be “held-to-maturity,” as
defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities

. These securities are reported at their
amortized cost, which includes the direct costs to acquire the
securities, plus the amortization of any discount or premium,
and accrued interest earned on the securities.

The following table summarizes the amortized cost
basis and aggregate fair value of Restricted Marketable
Securities, and gross unrealized holding gains and losses, at
December 31, 2001:

The fair value of Restricted Marketable
Securities has been estimated based on quoted market prices.

e.     Research
Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

As part of the Company’s research and
development efforts, the Company enters into research
collaboration and licensing agreements with related and
unrelated scientific collaborators, universities, and
consultants. The Company also has research collaborations with
Medarex, Inc. and Emisphere Technologies, Inc., and a license
and supply agreement with Shearwater Corporation. These
agreements contain varying terms and provisions which include
fees and milestones to be paid by the Company, services to be
provided, and ownership rights to certain proprietary technology
developed under the agreements. Some of the agreements contain
provisions which require the Company to pay royalties, as
defined, at rates that range from 0.25% to 12%, in the event the
Company sells or licenses any proprietary products developed
under the respective agreements.

Certain agreements, where the Company is required
to pay fees, provide for the Company, upon 30 to 90-day written
notice, to terminate such agreements. With respect to payments
associated with these agreements, the Company incurred expenses
of $1.1 million, $0.6 million, and $0.6 million
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

9.     Collaboration
Agreements

a.     Amgen
Inc.

In August 1990, the Company entered into a
collaboration agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with
Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) to develop and attempt to
commercialize two proprietary products (BDNF and NT-3,
individually the “Product,” collectively the
“Products”). The Amgen Agreement, among other things,
provided for Amgen and the Company to form a partnership
(“Amgen-Regeneron Partners” or the
“Partnership”) to complete the development and to
commercialize the Products. Amgen and the Company hold equal
ownership interests (subject to adjustment for any future
inequities in capital contributions, as defined). The
Partnership is the exclusive distributor of Products in the
United States, and Amgen has received a license from the Company
to market the Products outside the United States and outside
Japan and

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

certain Pacific Rim countries. The Company
accounts for its investment in the Partnership in accordance
with the equity method of accounting. In 2001, 2000, and 1999,
the Company recognized its share of the Partnership net loss in
the amounts of $1.0 million, $4.6 million, and
$4.2 million, respectively, which represents 50% of the
total Partnership net loss. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company continues to be an equal partner in the Partnership.

Payments the Company receives from the
Partnership in connection with services provided to the
Partnership, are recognized as contract research and development
revenue as earned. Such revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 totaled
$1.2 million, $6.2 million, and $3.6 million,
respectively. In addition, the Amgen Agreement contains a
provision whereby the Company will receive defined amounts
(“Research Progress Payments”) from Amgen if and when
each Product reaches certain levels of development.

In January 2001, Amgen-Regeneron Partners
discontinued all clinical development of BDNF for the potential
treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”)
following notification that BDNF did not provide a therapeutic
advantage to ALS patients in clinical trials. The Partnership
has no ongoing development activities for NT-3 at this time.

Selected financial data of the Partnership as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000 and for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, are as follows:

(1)

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, includes
	$0.2 million and $1.6 million due the Company,
	respectively.

(2)

Includes $1.2 million, $6.2 million,
	and $3.6 million related to services provided by the
	Company in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

During 1990, Amgen purchased 767,656 shares of
Series D convertible preferred stock for
$15.0 million. Such shares converted into 788,766 shares of
Class A Stock in April 1991 at the time of the
Company’s initial public offering. During April 1996, Amgen
purchased from the Company 3.0 million shares of Common
Stock and 700,000 warrants for $48.0 million. During March
2000, in accordance with the terms of their warrant agreement,
as amended, Amgen exercised their 700,000 warrants with an
exercise price of $16.00 per share. As consideration for the
exercise price, Amgen tendered 221,958 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock, which had an aggregate fair market
value at the time of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise
price of the warrants. The shares of Common Stock delivered to
the Company by Amgen were retired upon receipt.

During October 2000, Amgen and Regeneron entered
into an agreement whereby Regeneron acquired Amgen’s
patents and patent applications relating to ciliary neurotrophic
factor (“CNTF”) and related molecules for
$1.0 million. As part of this agreement, Regeneron granted
back to Amgen exclusive, royalty

free rights under these patents and patent
applications solely for human ophthalmic uses. In addition,
Regeneron entered into a covenant not to sue Amgen under
Regeneron’s patents and patent applications relating to
CNTF and related molecules solely for human ophthalmic uses.

b.     Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals Company, Ltd.

In June 1994, the Company entered into a research
and development agreement (the “R&D Agreement”)
with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Company, Ltd. (“Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals”) to collaborate in the research and
development of BDNF in Japan. In connection with the R&D
Agreement, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals made payments to the Company
for its activities in developing and validating manufacturing
processes for BDNF, and manufacturing and supplying BDNF and
other research materials to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals. In 2001,
2000, and 1999, Regeneron recognized contract research and
development revenue from Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals of
$0.1 million, $0.8 million, and $0.1 million,
respectively. In addition, the Company recognized contract
manufacturing revenue of $0.1 million and $4.1 million in
2001 and 2000, respectively, as supplies of BDNF were shipped
(FOB Destination Point) to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals.

In connection with the R&D Agreement, in
August 1998, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals signed a license agreement
with the Company for the development of BDNF in Japan. Pursuant
to the license agreement, Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals made a
research progress payment of $3.0 million (reduced by
$0.3 million of Japanese withholding tax) in April 2000.
The amount received in 2000 is included in research progress
payments. In light of the discontinuation of BDNF development
for ALS, the Company does not expect to receive further payments
from Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals for research progress payments,
contract research and development, or contract manufacturing.

During 1989, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.
(“Sumitomo Chemical”), an affiliate of Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals, entered into a Technology Development Agreement
(“TDA”) with Regeneron and paid the Company
$5.6 million. In consideration for this payment, Sumitomo
Chemical received a fifteen year limited right of first
negotiation to license up to three of the Company’s product
candidates in Japan. In connection with the Company’s
implementation of SAB 101 (see Note 2), the Company is
recognizing this payment as revenue on a straight-line basis
over the term of the TDA.

In addition, Sumitomo Chemical also entered into
a stock purchase agreement whereby it purchased, for
$4.4 million, 885,062 shares of Class C Preferred
Stock. Such shares converted into 909,401 shares of Class A
Stock in April 1991 at the time of the Company’s initial
public offering.

c.     Glaxo
Wellcome plc

During 1993, the Company entered into a
collaborative research agreement with Glaxo Wellcome plc
(“Glaxo”). Products that are developed by the joint
efforts of Glaxo and the Company will be commercialized by one
or more equally owned joint ventures. Glaxo also purchased
500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of
$20 per share.

d.     The
Procter & Gamble Company

In May 1997, the Company entered into a long-term
collaboration agreement with The Procter & Gamble
Company (“P&G”) to discover, develop, and
commercialize pharmaceutical products (the “P&G
Agreement”) and P&G agreed to provide funding for
Regeneron’s research efforts related to the collaboration.
In connection with the collaboration, in June 1997 and August
2000, P&G purchased 4.35 million and 573,630 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock at $9.87 and $29.75 per share for a
total of $42.9 million and $17.1 million,
respectively. In June 1997, P&G also received five year
warrants to purchase an additional 1.45 million shares of the
Company’s stock at $9.87 per share, which were exercised in
August 2000. As consideration for the exercise price, P&G
tendered 511,125 shares of the Company’s Common Stock which
had an aggregate value at the time of exercise, based upon the
average market price of the Company’s Common Stock over
approximately the prior 30 trading days, equal to the aggregate
exercise price of the warrants. The net result of this warrant
exercise was that P&G acquired an additional 938,875 shares
of the

F-20


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in
thousands, except per share data)

Company’s Common Stock. The 511,125 shares
of Common Stock delivered to the Company by P&G were retired
upon receipt. These equity purchases were in addition to a
purchase by Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of
800,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for
$10.0 million that was completed in March 1997.

Effective December 31, 2000, the Company and
P&G entered into a new collaboration agreement, replacing
the P&G Agreement. The new agreement extends P&G’s
obligation to fund Regeneron research through December 2005,
with no further research obligations by either party thereafter,
and focuses the companies’ collaborative research on
therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to P&G.
Under the new agreement, beginning in the first quarter of 2001,
research support from P&G is $2.5 million per quarter,
before adjustments for inflation, through December 2005. Any
drugs that result from the collaboration will continue to be
jointly developed and marketed worldwide, with the companies
equally sharing development costs and profits. P&G and the
Company have divided rights to programs from the P&G
Agreement that are no longer part of the companies’
collaboration. Research funding from P&G related to the
collaboration totaled $59.1 million through December 31,
2001. In August 2000, P&G made two research progress
payments to Regeneron totaling $3.5 million. In addition, from
September 1997 to the third quarter of 1999, P&G also
provided research support for the Company’s AXOKINE®
program and, as a result, will be entitled to receive a small
royalty on any sales of AXOKINE.

Contract research and development revenue related
to the companies’ collaboration agreements, including
payments from P&G related to AXOKINE, was
$10.4 million, $28.3 million, and $20.8 million
in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 2001
and 2000, the P&G contract research revenue receivable was
$2.7 million and $6.9 million, respectively. There was
no P&G receivable balance at December 31, 1999.

10.     Manufacturing
Agreement

During 1995, the Company entered into a long-term
manufacturing agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., as amended,
(the “Merck Agreement”) to produce an intermediate
(the “Intermediate”) for a Merck pediatric vaccine at
the Company’s Rensselaer, New York facility. The Company
agreed to modify portions of its facility for manufacture of the
Intermediate and to assist Merck in securing regulatory approval
for such manufacture in the Company’s facility. The Merck
Agreement calls for the Company to manufacture Intermediate for
Merck for six years (the “Production Period”), with
certain minimum order quantities each year. The Production
Period commenced in November of 1999. The Merck Agreement is
expected to extend into 2005 and may be terminated at any time
by Merck, with prior notice.

Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for the
capital costs to modify the facility (“Capital
Costs”). Merck also agreed to pay an annual facility fee
(the “Facility Fee”) of $1.0 million beginning
March 1995, subject to annual adjustment for inflation. During
the Production Period, Merck agreed to reimburse the Company for
certain manufacturing costs, pay the Company a variable fee
based on the quantity of Intermediate supplied to Merck, and
make additional bi-annual payments (“Additional
Payments”), as defined. In addition, Merck agreed to
reimburse the Company for the cost of Company activities
performed on behalf of Merck prior to the Production Period and
for miscellaneous costs during the Production Period
(“Internal Costs”). These payments are recognized as
contract manufacturing revenue as follows: (i) payments for
Internal Costs are recognized as the activities are performed,
(ii) the Facility Fee and Additional Payments are
recognized over the period to which they relate,
(iii) payments for Capital Costs were deferred and are
recognized as Intermediate is shipped to Merck, and
(iv) payments related to the manufacture of Intermediate
during the Production Period (“Manufacturing
Payments”) are recognized after the Intermediate is tested
and approved by, and shipped (FOB Shipping Point) to, Merck.

In 2001, 2000, and 1999, Merck contract
manufacturing revenue totaled $9.8 million, $12.5 million,
and $10.0 million, respectively. Such amounts include
$1.8 million, $2.9 million, and $0.4 million of
previously deferred Capital Costs in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

11.     Incentive and
Stock Purchase Plans

a.     Long-Term
Incentive Plans

During 2000, the Company established the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“2000 Incentive Plan”) which provides for the
issuance of up to 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of
awards. Employees of the Company, including officers, and
nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members of
the Board of Directors, (collectively, “Participants”)
may receive awards as determined by a committee of independent
directors (“Committee”). The awards that may be made
under the 2000 Incentive Plan include: (a) Incentive Stock
Options (“ISOs”) and Nonqualified Stock Options,
(b) shares of Restricted Stock, (c) shares of Phantom
Stock, (d) Stock Bonuses, and (e) Other Awards.

Stock Option awards grant Participants the right
to purchase shares of Common Stock at prices determined by the
Committee; however, in the case of an ISO, the option exercise
price will not be less than the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock on the date the Option is granted. Options vest
over a period of time determined by the Committee, generally on
a pro rata basis over a three to five year period. The Committee
also determines the expiration date of each Option; however, no
ISO is exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock awards grant Participants shares
of restricted Common Stock or allow Participants to purchase
such shares at a price determined by the Committee. Such shares
are nontransferable for a period determined by the Committee
(“vesting period”). Should employment terminate, as
defined by the 2000 Incentive Plan, the ownership of the
Restricted Stock will be transferred to the Company, except
under defined circumstances with Committee approval, in
consideration of amounts, if any, paid by the Participant to
acquire such shares. In addition, if the Company requires a
return of the Restricted Shares, it also has the right to
require a return of all dividends paid on such shares.

Phantom Stock awards provide the Participant the
right to receive, within 30 days of the date on which the
share vests, an amount, in cash and/or shares of the
Company’s Common Stock as determined by the Committee,
equal to the sum of the fair market value of a share of Common
Stock on the date such share of Phantom Stock vests and the
aggregate amount of cash dividends paid with respect to a share
of Common Stock during the period from the grant date of the
share of Phantom Stock to the date on which the share vests.
Stock Bonus awards are bonuses payable in shares of Common Stock
which are granted at the discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards are other forms of awards which are
valued based on the Company’s Common Stock. Subject to the
provisions of the 2000 Incentive Plan, the terms and provisions
of such Other Awards are determined solely on the authority of
the Committee.

During 1990, the Company established the
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“1990 Incentive Plan”) which, as amended, provided
for a maximum of 6,900,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of
awards. Employees of the Company, including officers, and
nonemployees, including consultants and nonemployee members of
the Board of Directors, received awards as determined by a
committee of independent directors. Under the provisions of the
1990 Incentive Plan, there will be no future awards from the
plan. Awards under the 1990 Incentive Plan consisted of
Incentive Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock Options which
generally vest on a pro rata basis over a three or five year
period and have a term of ten years.

F-22


REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL

(Unless otherwise noted, dollars in

The 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans contain
provisions that allow for the Committee to provide for the
immediate vesting of awards upon a change in control of the
Company, as defined.

The Company may incur charges to operations in
connection with awards from these Incentive Plans. In accordance
with APB No. 25 and related interpretations, the Company
will record compensation expense from employee stock-based
awards under certain conditions. Generally, when the terms of
the award and the amount the employee must pay to acquire the
stock are fixed, compensation expense for options, restricted
stock, and stock bonus awards will total the grant date
intrinsic value, if any, amortized over the vesting period. For
other awards, including phantom stock, compensation expense will
be recognized over the life of the award based on the cash
remitted to settle the award or the intrinsic value of the award
on the date of exercise.

Transactions involving stock option awards during
1999, 2000, and 2001, under the 1990 and 2000 Incentive Plans,
are summarized in the table below. Option exercise prices were
equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common
Stock on the date of grant. The total number of options
exercisable at December 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001 was
2,366,180, 2,533,662, and 3,374,169 respectively, with weighted
average exercise prices of $8.00, $8.31, and $11.99 respectively.

The following table summarizes stock option
information as of December 31, 2001:

The following table summarizes the pro forma
operating results of the Company had compensation costs for the
Incentive Plans been determined in accordance with the fair
value based method of accounting for stock based compensation as
prescribed by SFAS No. 123. Since option grants awarded
during 2001, 2000, and 1999 vest over several years and
additional awards are expected to be issued in the future, the
pro forma results shown below are not likely to be
representative of the effects on future years of the application
of the fair value based method.

For the purpose of the above pro forma
calculation, the fair value of each option granted from the
Incentive Plans during 2001, 2000, and 1999 was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
weighted-average fair value of the options granted during 2001,
2000, and 1999 was $19.74, $24.35, and $5.27, respectively. The
following table summarizes the assumptions used in computing the
fair value of option grants.

During 2001 and 2000, 80,535 and 34,785 shares of
Restricted Stock were awarded under the 2000 Incentive Plan.
These shares are nontransferable with such restriction lapsing
with respect to 25% of the shares every six months over a
two-year period beginning in January 2002 and 2001,
respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company recorded unearned compensation within
Stockholders’ Equity of $2.2 million and $1.3 million
in 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to these awards. This
amount was based on the fair market value of shares of the
Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and will be
expensed, on a pro rata basis, over the two year period that the
restriction on these shares lapses.

The Company recognized compensation expense from
stock-based awards of $0.7 million in 2001 and
$0.4 million (see Note 7) in 1999. No stock-based
compensation expense was recognized during 2000.

As of December 31, 2001, there were
1,446,396 shares available for future grants under the 2000
Incentive Plan.

b.     Executive
Stock Purchase Plan

In 1989, the Company adopted an Executive Stock
Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) under which 1,027,500
shares of Class A Stock were reserved for restricted stock
awards. The Plan provides for the compensation committee of the
Board of Directors to award employees, directors, consultants,
and other individuals (“Plan participants”) who render
service to the Company the right to purchase Class A Stock
at a price set by the compensation committee. The Plan provides
for the vesting of shares as determined by the compensation
committee and, should the Company’s relationship with a
Plan participant terminate before all shares are vested,
unvested shares will be repurchased by the Company at a price
per share equal to the original amount paid by the Plan
participant. During 1989 and 1990, a total of 983,254 shares
were issued, all of which vested as of December 31, 1999.
As of December 31, 2001, there were 44,246 shares available
for future grants under the Plan.

12.     Employee
Savings Plan

In 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of
the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the
“Savings Plan”). The terms of the Savings Plan provide
for employees who have met defined service requirements to
participate in the Savings Plan by electing to contribute to the
Savings Plan a percentage of their compensation to be set aside
to pay their future retirement benefits, as defined. The Savings
Plan, as amended and restated during 1998, provides for the
Company to make discretionary contributions
(“Contribution”), as defined. The Company recorded
Contribution expense of $0.6 million in 2001,
$0.5 million in 2000, and $0.4 million in 1999; such
amounts were accrued as liabilities at December 31, 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. During the first quarter of 2002,
2001, and 2000, the Company contributed 21,953, 17,484, and
54,003 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to the Savings Plan
in satisfaction of these obligations.

13.     Income
Taxes

There is no benefit for federal or state income
taxes for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, since
the Company has incurred operating losses since inception and
established a valuation allowance equal to the total deferred
tax asset. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company capitalized research and development costs for tax
purposes which resulted in taxable income of approximately
$6.5 million. However, there is no tax provision for the
year ended December 31, 2001 as the Company was able to
utilize net operating loss carryforwards that previously had
been fully provided for. The effects of the alternative minimum
tax on the 2001 provision were immaterial.

The tax effect of temporary differences, net
operating loss carry-forwards, and research and experimental tax
credit carry-forwards as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was
as follows:

For all years presented, the Company’s
effective income tax rate is zero. The difference between the
Company’s effective income tax rate and the Federal
statutory rate of 35% is attributable to state tax benefits and
tax credit carry-forwards offset by an increase in the deferred
tax valuation allowance.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had
available for tax purposes unused net operating loss
carry-forwards of $180.6 million which will expire in
various years from 2006 to 2021. The Company’s research and
experimental tax credit carry-forwards expire in various years
from 2004 to 2021. Future changes in the ownership of the
Company could limit the future utilization of these net
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards, as defined by the
Federal and state tax codes.

14.     Legal
Matters

The Company, from time to time, has been subject
to legal claims arising in connection with its business. While
the ultimate results of the legal claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, at December 31, 2001 there were no asserted
claims against the Company which, in the opinion of management,
if adversely decided would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.

15.     Net Loss Per
Share

The Company’s basic net loss per share
amounts have been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of Common and Class A shares outstanding. In
2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company reported net losses and,
therefore, no common stock equivalents were included in the
computation of diluted net loss per share since such inclusion
would have been antidilutive. The calculations of basic and
diluted net loss per share are as follows:

Options, warrants, and convertible debt which
have been excluded from the diluted per share amounts because
their effect would have been antidilutive include the following:

17.     Unaudited
Quarterly Results

Effective January 1, 2000, the Company

conform with the guidance provided by SAB 101 (see Note 2).
The cumulative effect of adopting SAB 101 at January 1,
2000 amounted to $1.6 million of additional loss, with a
corresponding increase to deferred revenue that is being
recognized in subsequent periods, of which $0.4 million was
included in contract research and development revenue in 2001
and 2000.

Summarized quarterly financial data for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 are displayed in the
following tables. Effective in 2001, the Company’s
financial statement presentation of investment income in the
Statement of Operations was reclassified to other income.
Formerly, investment income was included in revenues. The effect
of this reclassification for the quarters ended March 31,
June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2000 is

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS

The Partners

Amgen-Regeneron Partners

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Amgen-Regeneron Partners, a Delaware general partnership, as
of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements
of operations, changes in partners’ capital (deficit), and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Partnership’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Amgen-Regeneron Partners at December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2001

1.     Summary of
significant accounting policies

Business and
organization

Amgen-Regeneron Partners (the Partnership), a
general partnership, was formed on June 21, 1991, under the
laws of the state of Delaware between Amgen Inc. (Amgen) and
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron). The Partnership was
formed to develop and commercialize in the United States
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Neurotrophin-3
(NT-3, together with BDNF, the Products) for human
pharmaceutical use, in conformity with a collaboration agreement
(the Collaboration Agreement) (Note 3).

In January 1997, Amgen and Regeneron announced
that the Phase 3 clinical trial of BDNF did not demonstrate
clinical efficacy in the end points measured in patients with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou
Gehrig’s Disease. The trial was designed to evaluate the
effects of subcutaneous delivery of BDNF for ALS. On behalf of
the Partnership, Amgen continued to conduct clinical trials of
intrathecal delivery of BDNF for ALS, and Regeneron continued to
conduct clinical trials of subcutaneous delivery of BDNF for
ALS. In January 2001, Amgen and Regeneron were notified that
clinical trials for both intrathecal and subcutaneous delivery
of BDNF did not provide a therapeutic advantage to ALS patients.
As a result, in 2001 the Partnership discontinued all clinical
development of BDNF for the potential treatment of ALS following
the notification.

Regeneron, on behalf of the Partnership,
conducted clinical trials of NT-3 in patients with functional
constipation and spinal cord injury patients with bowel
dysfunction. The Partnership has evaluated preliminary data from
these clinical trials and there are no ongoing development
activities for the product candidate at this time.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Amgen would be
primarily responsible for the manufacture and commercialization
of the Products in the United States if successfully developed
by the Partnership. Amgen’s costs in connection with such
activities would be reimbursed at agreed-to rates. Unless
terminated earlier, the Partnership will continue in effect,
with respect to each Product, until the later of the expiration
of the last United States patent of each Product, or
15 years from the date on which each Product was approved
for sale in the United States.

A Joint Management Committee (the Committee) is
responsible for the overall management of the business and
affairs of the Partnership as well as activities performed under
the Collaboration Agreement. Each partner has appointed three
representatives to the Committee. One additional representative
may be appointed by a partner if the balance of their capital
account becomes more than twice the amount of the balance of the
other partner’s capital account (Note 2).

Cash
equivalents

The Partnership considers only those investments
which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and which
mature within three months of the date of purchase as cash
equivalents. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, cash and cash
equivalents consisted of a single interest bearing money market
account.

Research and
development

Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. Clinical trial costs, which are a component of
research and development costs, are recognized based upon the
estimated levels of effort expended on those trials.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Income
taxes

The Partnership’s financial statements do
not include a provision (credit) for income taxes. Income taxes,
if any, are the liability of the individual partners.

Use of
estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

2.

Capital contributions, allocation of profits
	and losses and cash distributions

Capital contributions are recorded in the capital
account of each partner. Capital account contributions are
generally made quarterly in advance based upon capital calls
made by the Committee pursuant to projected cash requirements of
the Partnership. Cash distributions, if any, and profits or
losses are allocated to each partner’s capital account in
proportion to their respective capital account contributions.

3.

Collaboration Agreement

In August 1990, Amgen and Regeneron entered into
the Collaboration Agreement to develop and commercialize BDNF
and NT-3, compounds for which Regeneron possesses substantial
scientific, technical and proprietary information. Each party
agreed to perform research and development on the Products under
product development programs approved by the Committee. Upon
Amgen’s notification in writing to Regeneron that the
preparation of an Investigational New Drug Application for each
Product was to commence, the licenses granted by the partners to
the Partnership for the underlying technologies, discussed
below, became effective on a Product-by-Product basis. Also,
upon such notification, further research and development of the
Products under the licenses became the obligation of the
Partnership. These licenses grant the Partnership an exclusive
royalty-free right to develop, make, have made, use, sell and
distribute each Product for human pharmaceutical use in the
United States. The Partnership has, in turn, granted to Amgen
and Regeneron exclusive royalty-free sublicenses for the
underlying technologies to the extent necessary to fulfill their
obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. These sublicenses
became effective at the same time the related licenses granted
the Partnership became effective.

Pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration
Agreement, and subject to the approval by both parties, Amgen
and Regeneron can conduct certain research and development
activities on behalf of the Partnership, including contracting
with third parties to conduct clinical trials. Amgen also
provides on behalf of the Partnership certain quantities of
materials, primarily for clinical testing. Amgen and Regeneron
are paid for such services and materials at amounts approved by
the Committee. During the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, the Partnership incurred expenses (including
accrued expenses) of $866,000, $3,204,000 and $5,044,000,
respectively, from Amgen and $1,228,000, $6,232,000 and
$3,587,000, respectively, from Regeneron for such services and
materials. These amounts are included in research and
development expense in the accompanying statements of
operations. In addition, certain other costs associated with the
development of the Products have been incurred by the partners
but not charged to the Partnership or reflected in the
accompanying financial statements as the related development
activities are not billable to the Partnership under the terms
of the Collaboration Agreement. At December 31, 2001,
accounts payable and accrued expenses due to partners was
composed of $143,000 of accounts payable and $378,000 of accrued
clinical costs due to Amgen and $170,000 of accounts payable and
$77,000 of accrued clinical costs due to Regeneron. At
December 31, 2000, accounts payable and accrued expenses
due to partners was composed of $869,000 of accounts payable and
$2,162,000 of accrued clinical costs due to Amgen and $234,000
of accounts payable and $1,370,000 of accrued clinical costs due
to Regeneron.
