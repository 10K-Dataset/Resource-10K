PART I

Item 1.
Business

PepsiCo,  Inc.  was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1919 and was  reincorporated  in North  Carolina in 1986.  When used in this
Report the terms "we", "us", "our" and the "Company" means PepsiCo and its
divisions and subsidiaries.

On August 2, 2001,  we  completed a merger  transaction  with The Quaker  Oats  Company  ("Quaker")  whereby  Quaker  became a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of PepsiCo.  Under the merger  agreement dated December 2, 2000,  Quaker  shareholders  received 2.3 shares of
PepsiCo  common stock in exchange for each share of Quaker  common stock,  including a cash payment for  fractional  shares.  We issued
approximately 306 million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the
outstanding common stock of Quaker.

WORLDWIDE
SNACKS

Our snack food business is comprised of two business units: Frito-Lay North
America and Frito-Lay International.

Frito-Lay North America

snack foods  throughout  the United States and Canada,  including  Lay's potato chips,  Doritos and Tostitos  tortilla  chips,  Cheetos
cheese flavored  snacks,  Ruffles potato chips,  Fritos corn chips, a variety of dips and salsas,  Quaker Chewy granola bars, Rold Gold

FLNA's products are transported from  manufacturing  plants to our major  distribution  centers,  principally by company-owned
trucks.  FLNA  primarily  utilizes  a direct  store  delivery  system,  whereby  its sales  force  delivers  the snacks  directly  from
distribution  centers to the store shelf.  This system  permits FLNA to work closely with retail trade  locations  and to be responsive
to their needs.  Frito-Lay believes this form of distribution  allows it to have a marketing  advantage and is essential for the proper
distribution of fragile products and products with a short shelf
life.

FLNA also develops the national marketing,  promotion and advertising  programs that support the FLNA brands and related brand
images;  oversees the quality of the FLNA products;  develops new products and packaging;  approves packaging suppliers;  and leads and

through Snack Ventures  Europe, a joint venture between PepsiCo and General Mills,  Inc., in which we own a 60% interest.  In ten Latin
America  countries,  our snack food  business is  conducted  through  joint  ventures  between  PepsiCo and  Libracor,  Ltd., a part of
Venezuela's Empresas Polar Group.  We have a 50% interest in these ventures,
except in one country where we own a 70% interest.

FLI sells a variety of salty and sweet snack food  products  which  appeal to local  tastes  including  Sabritas  snack foods,
Alegro and Gamesa  sweet  snacks in Mexico,  Walkers  snack  foods in the United  Kingdom and Smith's  snack  foods in  Australia.  In
addition,  many of our U.S. brands, such as Lay's, Doritos,  Tostitos,  Cheetos,  Ruffles and Fritos brand salty snack foods, have been
introduced  internationally.  FLI's  products also include  various Quaker food and snack  products.  Principal  international  markets
include Mexico, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia

Competition

All of our businesses are highly competitive.  Our foods and beverages compete in the United States and  internationally  with
widely  distributed  products of a number of major  companies that operate in many of the areas we serve.  We also compete with private
label foods and beverages and with the products of local and regional  manufacturers.  The main areas of competition are price, quality
and variety of products, customer service and availability of
distribution.

Employees

As of December 29, 2001, we employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,  approximately  143,000  people  worldwide,  including
approximately 81,000 people employed within the United States.  We believe that
relations with our employees are generally good.

Raw Materials
and Other Supplies

The principal  materials we use in our food and beverage  businesses are almonds,  aspartame,  cocoa,  corn, corn  sweeteners,
flavorings,  flour, juice concentrates,  oats, oranges, grapefruits and other fruits, potatoes, rice, seasonings,  sugar, vegetable and
essential  oils,  wheat,  and  packaging  materials.  Key  packaging  materials  include  P.E.T.  resin used for  plastic  bottles  and
cardboard.  Since we rely on trucks to move and distribute many of our products,  fuel is also an important  commodity.  These products
are  purchased  mainly in the open  market.  We employ  specialists  to secure  adequate  supplies  of many of these items and have not
experienced any significant  continuous  shortages.  Prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation.  When prices increase, we
may or may not pass on such  increases to our  customers.  When we have decided to pass along price  increases in the past we have done
so successfully.  However, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so
in the future.

Governmental
Regulation

The conduct of our  businesses,  and the  production,  distribution  and use of many of our  products,  are subject to various
federal laws,  such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act. Our businesses are also subject to
state, local and foreign laws.

Quaker,  Cap'n Crunch,  Life,  Rice-A-Roni,  Near East, Pasta Roni,  Golden Grain and Aunt Jemima.  Trademarks  remain valid so long as
they are used properly for  identification  purposes,  and we emphasize  correct use of our  trademarks.  We have  authorized  (through
licensing  arrangements)  the use of many of our  trademarks  in such  contexts  as snack food joint  ventures  and  beverage  bottling
appointments.  In addition,  we license the use of our  trademarks on collateral  products for the primary  purpose of enhancing  brand
awareness.

We either own or have  licenses to use a number of patents  which relate to some of our products and the  processes  for their
production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our
businesses.  Some of these patents are licensed to others.

Our obligations under the lease is contingent upon completion of the building
and satisfaction of certain obligations by the lessor.

General

We own our corporate headquarters buildings in Purchase, New
York.

Leases of plants in the United States and Canada generally are on a long-term basis,  expiring at various times,  with options
to renew for  additional  periods.  Most  international  plants are leased for  varying and usually  shorter  periods,  with or without
renewal options.

We believe that our  properties  are in good  operating  condition  and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being
used.


Item 3. Legal
Proceedings

We are subject to various claims and  contingencies  related to lawsuits,  taxes,  environmental and other matters arising out
of the normal course of business.  Management  believes that the ultimate  liability,  if any, in excess of amounts already  recognized
for such claims or contingencies is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,  financial  condition or
liquidity.

Cautionary Statements

From time to time, in written  reports and in oral  statements,  we discuss  expectations  regarding our future  performance  including
synergies from the merger,  the impact of the euro conversion and the impact of global  macroeconomic  issues.  These  "forward-looking
statements" are based on currently  available  competitive,  financial and economic data and our operating  plans.  They are inherently
uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be
significantly different from our expectations.

INTRODUCTION TO OUR BUSINESS

Critical
Accounting Policies

An understanding of our accounting  policies is necessary for a complete  analysis of our results,  financial  position,  liquidity and
trends.  We focus your attention on the following:

Principles  of  consolidation

- The  financial  statements  include the  consolidated  accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and its  controlled
affiliates.  Investments in unconsolidated  affiliates over which we exercise  significant  influence,  but not control,  are accounted
for by the equity  method.  Our  definition  of control for majority  owned  affiliates  considers the  exercisability  of the minority
interest  rights,  and  consolidation  would be precluded  to the extent that the minority  interest  holds  substantive  participating
rights.  Our share of the net income or loss of  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for by the  equity  method is  included  in our
consolidated  net income.  As a result of changes in the  operations of our European  snack joint  venture,  we have  determined  that,
effective in 2002, consolidation is required.

Revenue  recognition

- We  recognize  revenue when  products are  delivered  to  customers  consistent  with sales terms.  Sales terms
generally do not allow a right of return.


Derivative  instruments and hedging

- We manage risks associated with commodity prices,  foreign exchange rates, interest rates and our
stock price and may use  derivative  instruments  to hedge these risks.  As a matter of policy,  we do not use  derivative  instruments
unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore,  we do not use derivative  instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  The
evaluation  of hedge  effectiveness  is  subject  to  assumptions  based on the  terms  and  timing of the  underlying  exposures.  All
derivative  instruments are recognized in our Consolidated  Balance Sheet at fair value.  The fair value of our derivative  instruments
is generally based on quoted market prices.

Asset  impairment

- All long-lived  assets,  including  goodwill,  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and other  identifiable
intangibles,  are  evaluated  for  impairment  on the basis of  undiscounted  cash flows  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances
indicate that the carrying  amount of an asset may not be  recoverable.  An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market
value based on the best  information  available.  Estimated  fair market value is generally  measured by discounting  estimated  future
cash flows.  Considerable  management  judgment is necessary to estimate  discounted future cash flows.  Assumptions used in these cash
flows are consistent with internal forecasts.

Income  taxes

- Our  effective  tax rate and the tax bases of our assets and  liabilities  reflect our best  estimate  of the  ultimate
outcome of tax audits.  Valuation  allowances are established  where expected future taxable income does not support the realization of
the deferred tax assets.

Commitments  and  contingencies

- We are subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to lawsuits,  taxes and  environmental
matters,  as well as commitments under  contractual and other commercial  obligations.  We recognize  liabilities for contingencies and
commitments  when a loss is  probable  and  estimable.  Our  contractual  and  other  commercial  obligations  primarily  relate to the
procurement of goods and services in the normal course of business and to
guarantees related to our equity investees.

Refer to

Note 1

to the financial statements for additional information on our accounting
policies.

Transactions with Related and Other Parties

Significant  related  parties  include our bottling  franchisees in which we own an equity  interest.  We have entered into  agreements
with  these  bottlers  and  expect  these  arrangements  to  continue.  These  agreements  cover the  prices  and terms for the sale of
concentrate  and full goods  bearing our  trademarks,  as well as the  manufacturing  and  distribution  of our fountain  products.  In
addition,  we provide various forms of marketing  support to or on behalf of our bottlers  covering a variety of initiatives  including
marketplace support,  marketing programs,  capital equipment and shared media expense. The level of this support is negotiated annually
and can be increased or decreased at our  discretion.  We provide this support  because we share a common  business  objective with our
bottlers of increasing the availability  and consumption of Pepsi-Cola  beverages and the level of support has a direct impact on these
objectives.  See

Liquidity  and Capital  Resources

for related  party  commitments  and  guarantees

Certain  members of our Board of Directors  also serve on the boards of certain  vendors and  customers.  Our  transactions  with these
vendors and customers are in the normal  course of business and  consistent  with terms  negotiated  with other vendors and  customers.
Those Board members do not  participate  in vendor  selection  and  negotiations  nor in customer  negotiations.  In addition,  certain
officers  serve on the boards of our anchor  bottlers  and other  equity  investees  and may receive  compensation  from such  entities
consistent with that of other members serving on those boards.

Items
Affecting Comparability

Fifty-third Week in 2000

Comparisons  of 2000 to 2001 and 1999 are affected by an  additional  week of results in the 2000  reporting  year.  Because our fiscal
year ends on the last Saturday in December,  a fifty-third  week is added every five or six years.  The fifty-third week increased 2000
net sales by an estimated  $294  million,  operating  profit by an estimated  $62 million and net income by an estimated $44 million or
$0.02 per share.

Merger of
PepsiCo and The Quaker Oats Company

Under the Quaker merger agreement dated December 2, 2000, Quaker  shareholders  received 2.3 shares of PepsiCo common stock in exchange
for each share of Quaker common stock,  including a cash payment for fractional  shares. We issued  approximately 306 million shares of
our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of
Quaker.

In connection with the merger  transaction,  we sold the global rights in our All Sport beverage brand to The Monarch Company,  Inc. of
Atlanta.  As part of the terms of the sale,  we agreed  that,  for 10 years after the Quaker  transaction  closing  date,  we would not
distribute  Gatorade  sports drink  through our bottling  system in the United States and would not include  Gatorade  with  Pepsi-Cola
products in certain marketing or promotional arrangements covering specific
distribution channels.

The merger was  accounted for as a tax-free  transaction  and as a  pooling-of-interests.  As a result,  all prior period  consolidated
financial  statements  presented  have been restated to include the results of  operations,  financial  position and cash flows of both
companies  as if they had always been  combined.  Certain  reclassifications  were made to conform the  presentation  of the  financial
statements,  and the fiscal calendar and certain interim reporting  policies were also conformed.  There were no material  transactions
between pre-merger PepsiCo and Quaker.


The results of operations of the separate  companies and the combined  company for the most recent  interim  period prior to the merger
and for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements are as
follows:

Adjustments reflect the impact of changing Quaker’s fiscal
calendar to conform to PepsiCo’s and conforming the accounting policies of
the two companies applicable to interim reporting. These changes have no impact
on full year net sales or net income.

During 2001, we recognized
costs of $356 million associated with our merger with Quaker. The components of
these merger-related costs were as follows:

Transaction costs were
incurred to complete the merger and consist primarily of fees and expenses for
investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, SEC filing fees, stock exchange
listing fees and financial printing and other related charges.

Integration costs represent
incremental one-time merger-related costs. Such costs include consulting fees
and expenses, expenses for accelerated vesting under change-in-control
provisions, information system integration costs and employee-related costs.

The restructuring charges
primarily reflect termination costs for approximately 580 corporate, sales,
distribution, manufacturing, research and marketing employees. Employee
termination costs include retirement benefit costs, severance costs and expenses
associated with change-in-control provisions of pre-merger employment contracts.
As of December 29, 2001, approximately 380 of the terminations have occurred.
The terminations are expected to be completed during 2002.


Additional merger-related
actions are expected to bring the total integration costs and restructuring
charges to between $450 million and $550 million. Ongoing merger-related cost
savings and revenue enhancement opportunities are expected to reach $400 million
a year by 2005. We expect to achieve up to $175 million of the synergies by the
end of 2002.

2001 and

The 2001 and 2000 other
impairment and restructuring charges relate to a three-year supply chain
reconfiguration project announced in 1999 to upgrade and optimize Quaker’s
manufacturing and distribution capabilities across all of its North American
businesses.

The asset impairment
charges primarily reflect the reduction in the carrying value of the land,
buildings and production machinery and equipment to their estimated fair market
value based on analyses of the liquidation values of similar assets. The
restructuring charges primarily included severance and termination benefits for
approximately 1,000 employees and other shutdown costs. No future charges are
expected on this project.


The 1999 other impairment and restructuring charges of $73 million were comprised of the following:

•

A charge of $65 million, for asset impairment of $37 million and
restructuring charges of $28 million, related to the closure of three plants and
impairment of equipment at Frito-Lay North America. The asset impairment charges
primarily reflected the reduction in the carrying value of the land and
buildings to their estimated fair market value based on selling prices for
comparable real estate, less costs to sell, and the write off of the net book
value of equipment which could not be redeployed. The plant closures were
completed during 1999. The majority of these assets were either disposed of or
abandoned in 1999. The restructuring charges of $28 million primarily included
severance costs and plant closing costs.


•

A charge of $8 million, for asset impairment of $5 million and
restructuring charges of $3 million, related to the previously discussed Quaker
supply chain reconfiguration project. The charge included costs to consolidate
several cereal manufacturing lines and employee-related costs.

The employee-related costs
for 1999 of $20 million primarily included severance and early retirement
benefits for approximately 930 employees. Substantially all of the terminations
occurred during 1999.

Total restructuring
reserves of $100 million, including merger-related reserves, at December 29,
2001, are included in accounts payable and other current liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Bottling
Transactions

During 1999, we completed a
series of transactions creating our anchor bottlers. In April 1999, certain
wholly-owned bottling businesses, referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),
completed an initial public offering with PepsiCo retaining a direct
noncontrolling ownership interest of 35.5%. In May, we combined certain other
bottling operations with Whitman Corporation retaining a noncontrolling
ownership interest of approximately 38%. In July, we combined certain other
bottling operations with PepCom Industries, Inc. retaining a noncontrolling
interest of 35% in the combined entity renamed Pepsi Bottling Ventures, LLC. In
October, we formed a business venture with Pohlad Companies, a Pepsi-Cola
franchisee, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 24%
in the venture’s principal operating subsidiary, PepsiAmericas, Inc.

Our financial statements
include the results of our bottling operations on a consolidated basis through
the transaction dates above, and our proportionate share of income under the
equity method subsequent to those dates.

In December 2000, Whitman
merged with PepsiAmericas. We now own approximately 37% of the combined company,
which has since changed its name to PepsiAmericas, Inc. As part of the merger,
we participate in an earn-out option whereby we may receive additional shares
when certain performance targets are met.

Our three anchor bottlers
distribute approximately three-fourths of our beverage products in North
America.

Tax
Item

In 1999, Quaker adjusted
its tax accruals and tax assets to reflect developments and information received
during the year. The net effect of these adjustments reduced the income tax
provision by $59 million or $0.03 per share.


New Accounting
Standards

On December 31, 2000, we
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (SFAS) 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. SFAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
activities. It requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as either
assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and measure those
instruments at fair value. The adoption of SFAS 133 on December 31, 2000
increased assets by approximately $12 million and liabilities by approximately
$10 million with approximately $3 million recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income and a loss of less than $1 million recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.

During 2000 and 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) addressed various issues related to the income statement classification
of certain promotional payments, including consideration from a vendor to a
reseller or another party that purchases the vendor’s products. EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of
the Vendor’s Products

was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier
pronouncements. Primarily effective for 2002, adoption of EITF 01-9 will reduce
our net sales by $3.4 billion in 2001, $3.1 billion in 2000 and $2.9 billion in
1999, with selling, general and administrative expenses reduced by the same
amounts.

In July 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 141,

Business Combinations.

SFAS 141 eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies
the application of the purchase accounting method. The elimination of the
pooling-of-interests method is effective for transactions initiated after June
30, 2001. The remaining provisions of SFAS 141 are effective for transactions
accounted for using the purchase method that are completed after June 30, 2001.
Since our merger with Quaker (see

Note 2

to the consolidated financial
statements) was initiated in December 2000 and our acquisition of South Beach
Beverage Company, LLC (see

Note 4

to the consolidated financial statements) was
completed in January 2001, adoption of this statement does not have an impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2001, the FASB also
issued SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Intangibles.

SFAS 142 eliminates the
current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses
impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS 142
applies to existing goodwill and intangible assets, as well as to transactions
completed after the statement’s effective date. SFAS 142 is effective for
2002. Adoption of SFAS 142 will increase income before taxes by approximately
$87 million in 2002 reflecting the cessation of goodwill amortization and
changes in the lives of other intangibles. The required transition impairment
evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges.

In June 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

. SFAS 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. It requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. We are currently assessing SFAS 143 and the
impact that adoption, in 2003, will have on our consolidated financial
statements.


In August 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

. SFAS 144 establishes a single model for the impairment of long-lived
assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more
disposal transactions. SFAS 144 is effective for 2002. Adoption will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Market and
Other Risk Factors

Market
Risks

The principal market risks
(i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices)
to which we are exposed are:

•

commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and
fuel;

•

foreign exchange risks;

•

interest rates on our debt and short-term
investment portfolios; and

•

our stock price.

In the normal course of
business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including the
use of hedging transactions, executed in accordance with our policies.

Our hedging transactions
include, but are not limited to, the use of various derivative instruments. As a
matter of policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an
underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not use derivative instruments for
trading or speculative purposes. Any change in the value of our derivative
instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of
the underlying hedged items.

Commodity
Prices

We are subject to market
risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover
increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate. We manage this risk primarily through the use
of fixed-price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and
derivative instruments. Derivative instruments, including futures, options and
swaps, are used to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated
commodity purchases, primarily corn, oats, natural gas, heating oil, vegetable
oil and packaging materials. Our use of derivative instruments is not
significant to our commodity purchases.

Our commodity derivative
positions were $252 million at December 29, 2001 and $52 million at December 30,
2000. Our commodity derivative positions resulted in a net unrealized loss of
$16 million at December 29, 2001 and a net unrealized gain of $3 million at
December 30, 2000. We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have
increased the loss by $18 million in 2001 and reduced the gain by $6 million
resulting in a loss in 2000.


Foreign
Exchange

International operations
constitute about one-fifth of our annual business segment operating profit.
Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in foreign
exchange rates, primarily the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, euro
and Brazilian real, which principally impacts the translation of our
international operating profit into U.S. dollars. On occasion, we may enter into
derivative instruments, as necessary, to reduce the effect of foreign exchange
rate changes. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

Our foreign currency
derivative positions had an aggregate notional value of $355 million, with $223
million relating to contracts to exchange British pounds for U.S. dollars, at
December 29, 2001 and $344 million, with $336 million relating to contracts to
exchange British pounds to U.S. dollars, at December 30, 2000. These forward
contracts had a net gain of $4 million at December 29, 2001 and losses of $9
million at December 30, 2000. We estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the
exchange rates would have decreased the 2001 gain by $35 million resulting in a
loss and increased the 2000 losses by $35 million.

Interest
Rates

We centrally manage our
debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,
tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use interest rate and
currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific
debt issuances, with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs.
These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that
they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity
date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the
related debt. Our credit risk related to interest rate and currency swaps is
considered low because such swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy
counterparties, are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short
duration.

Assuming year-end 2001 and
2000 variable rate debt and investment levels, a one-point increase in interest
rates would have increased net interest expense by $3 million in 2001 and $7
million in 2000. The change in this impact from 2000 resulted from decreased
variable debt levels and increased investment levels at year-end 2001. This
sensitivity analysis includes the impact of existing interest rate and currency
swaps.

Stock
Price

The portion of our deferred
compensation liability which is based on our stock price is subject to market
risk. Prepaid forward contracts with financial institutions with an aggregate
notional amount of $52 million at year-end 2001 were used to hedge this risk and
are accounted for as natural hedges. The change in fair value of these equity
derivative contracts resulted in $1 million of expense in 2001, $19 million of
income in 2000 and $6 million of expense in 1999. We estimate that a 10%
unfavorable change in the year-end stock price would have increased the 2001
loss by $6 million and reduced the 2000 gain by $7 million.


Euro
Conversion

Our operating subsidiaries
affected by the euro conversion successfully addressed the issues raised by the
euro currency conversion including, among others, adapting computer and
financial systems, business processes and equipment, such as vending machines,
to accommodate euro-denominated transactions and took actions to reduce the
impact of one common currency on cross-border pricing. We have experienced no
business interruption as a result of the issuance and circulation of
euro-denominated bills and coins and the withdrawal of legacy currencies. The
system and equipment conversion costs were not material. Due to numerous
uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the long-term effects one common
currency may have on pricing and the resulting impact, if any, on financial
condition or results of operations.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

In the discussions below,
the year-over-year dollar change in unit sales is referred to as

the impact of the fifty-third week in 2000,

•

other impairment and restructuring charges and various Quaker one-time items
and

•

the gain on the bottling transactions in 1999, and also

•

reflect the impact of certain reclassifications and tax
items.

In addition, comparable net sales and operating profit present the deconsolidation

Comparable

$26,935

$25,185        $23,385



In 2001, comparable net
sales increased 7%. This increase is primarily due to volume gains and higher
effective net pricing of worldwide snacks and worldwide beverages, as well as
the acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC (SoBe). These gains were
partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. The SoBe
acquisition enhanced comparable net sales growth by nearly 1 percentage point
and the unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Brazil and Europe,
reduced comparable net sales growth by more than 1 percentage point.


In 2000, comparable net
sales increased 8%. This increase is primarily due to volume gains and higher
effective net pricing of worldwide snacks, Pepsi-Cola North America and PepsiCo
Beverages International. These increases were partially offset by a net
unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, which reduced
comparable net sales growth by 1 percentage point. The fifty-third week enhanced
reported net sales growth by 1 percentage point.

Volume

Servings are based on U.S.
Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our

In 2000, comparable
operating profit margin increased 0.8 percentage points primarily reflecting the
favorable margin impact of higher effective net pricing and increased volume.
These improvements were partially offset by the margin impact of increases in
selling and distribution expenses, primarily in Frito-Lay International,
advertising and marketing and general and administrative expenses.

Bottling
Equity Income and Transaction Gains and Losses

Bottling equity income and
transaction gains and losses includes our share of the net earnings or losses
from our bottling equity investments. From time to time, we may increase or
dispose of particular bottling investments. Any gains or losses from disposals,
as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments, are also
reflected on a pre-tax basis in equity income and transaction gains and losses.


In 2001, comparable net
bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses increased 28% to $160
million, primarily reflecting the strong performance of PBG. Results for 2001
also include a gain of $59 million from the sale of approximately 2 million
shares of PBG stock and a net credit of $23 million related to the resolution of
issues for which a prior year accrual was established in connection with the
creation of our anchor bottler system. These increases were offset by impairment
charges of $62 million related to certain international bottling investments,
primarily our equity investment in Turkey, reflecting a major currency
devaluation and adverse macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, $27 million for
our share of a charge recorded by PepsiAmericas for environmental liabilities
relating to discontinued operations is included in our share of the net earnings
from our bottling equity investments in 2001.

In 2000, comparable net
bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses increased 51% to $125
million. Our share of net earnings from our bottling equity investments includes
$18 million from the favorable impact of an accounting change by PBG. In
addition, results for 2000 include our share of charges related to restructuring
actions in certain other bottling affiliates and the net loss from changes in
our equity ownership interests. The fifty-third week in 2000 enhanced reported
net bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses by $5 million.

In 1999, reported bottling
equity income and transaction gains and losses includes a gain on bottling
transactions of $1.0 billion ($270 million after-tax or $0.15 per share)
relating to the second quarter PBG and Whitman bottling transactions. The PBG
transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion ($476 million after-tax
or $0.26 per share). The majority of the taxes are expected to be deferred
indefinitely. The Whitman transaction resulted in an after-tax loss to us of
$206 million or $0.11 per share. The 1999 PepCom transaction was accounted for
as a nonmonetary exchange for book purposes. However, a portion of the
transaction was taxable which resulted in income tax expense of $25 million or
$0.01 per share. The 1999 Pohlad transaction was structured as a fair value
exchange with no resulting gain or loss. Further, 1999 bottling equity income
and transaction gains and losses reflects $83 million for the equity income of
our previously consolidated bottling operations from the applicable transaction
closing dates and the equity income or loss of other unconsolidated bottling
affiliates for the second, third and fourth quarters.

Reported and comparable
interest income in 2001 includes a loss on investments used to economically
hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. Reported interest income
in 2000 and 1999 includes gains or losses from the equity derivative contracts
used to hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These equity
derivative gains or losses are now classified in selling, general and
administrative expenses in connection with the 2001 adoption of the accounting
standard on derivative instruments. Comparable interest income for 2000 and 1999
reflects this reclassification. The fifty-third week increased reported net
interest expense in 2000 by $3 million.

In 2001, comparable net
interest expense declined 25%. Interest expense declined primarily as a result
of significantly lower average debt levels. Interest income remained nearly flat
as the increase from higher average investment balances was offset by lower
average interest rates and a loss on the investments hedging a portion of our
deferred compensation liability.

In 2000, comparable net
interest expense declined 29%. Interest expense declined reflecting
significantly lower average debt levels, partially offset by higher average
interest rates. Lower average debt levels reflect the third quarter 1999
repayment of borrowings used to finance the Tropicana acquisition and the
absence of the financing related to PBG. Interest income declined primarily due
to lower average investment balances.

on foreign results. The reported effective tax rate increased 1.5 percentage
points primarily due to limited tax benefits associated with merger-related
costs recognized during the year.

In 2000, the comparable
effective tax rate remained nearly flat. The reported effective tax rate
decreased 9 percentage points primarily as a result of the 1999 bottling
transactions.

These increases primarily reflect increased operating profit, lower net interest
expense and a lower effective tax rate.

In 2000, comparable net
income increased 17% and the related net income per common share increased 18%
reflecting higher operating profit and lower net interest expense. The increase
in net income per common share also reflects the benefit from a 1.4% reduction
in average shares outstanding.

2001 vs. 2000

Pound volume advanced 3%
excluding the impact of the fifty-third week in 2000. This growth was led by
single-digit growth in Lay’s potato chips, Cheetos cheese flavored snacks,
Doritos tortilla chips, Fritos corn chips and the introduction of our new
Lay’s Bistro Gourmet potato chips. These gains were partially offset by a
double-digit decline in Ruffles potato chips. Pound volume growth including the
fifty-third week in 2000 was 1%.

Comparable net sales grew
6% due to higher effective net pricing and the increased volume. Lay’s
Bistro Gourmet potato chips contributed nearly 1 percentage point to this
growth.

Comparable operating profit
increased 10% primarily reflecting the higher effective net pricing and
increased volume, partially offset by increased advertising and marketing
expenses. Advertising and marketing expenses grew at a faster rate than sales
primarily due to increased promotional allowances.

2000 vs. 1999

Pound volume advanced 5%
excluding the impact of the fifty-third week. This growth was primarily driven
by most of our core brands, excluding the low-fat and no-fat versions, and by
our new Snack Kit products. The growth in core brands was led by solid
single-digit growth in Lay’s potato chips, Cheetos cheese flavored snacks
and Ruffles potato chips, as well as double-digit growth in Tostitos tortilla
chips. These gains were partially offset by continued declines in WOW! products.
Pound volume growth including the fifty-third week was 7%.

Comparable net sales
increased 7% primarily due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing.
Sales of our new Snack Kit and Snack Mix products and Oberto natural beef jerky
snacks accounted for almost 30% of this growth. The fifty-third week enhanced
reported net sales growth by 2 percentage points.


Comparable operating profit
increased 12% primarily reflecting the higher volume, the higher effective net
pricing and reduced vegetable oil costs, partially offset by higher energy and
fuel costs. Advertising and marketing expenses grew at a slightly slower rate
than sales. The margin impact of these favorable factors contributed to the
comparable operating profit margin improvement of 0.9 percentage points. The
fifty-third week enhanced reported operating profit growth by 2 percentage
points.

2001 vs. 2000

Kilo volume increased 6%,
excluding the impact of the fifty-third week in 2000. This growth was primarily
driven by a 9% increase in salty snack kilos and a 5% increase in sweet snack
kilos. The salty snack growth was led by double-digit growth at our European
joint venture, in Brazil and in Poland and single-digit growth at Walkers.
Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of salty growth. The sweet snack
increase was primarily attributable to growth at Gamesa. Kilo volume growth
including the fifty-third week in 2000 was 5%.

Comparable net sales
increased 7%, primarily driven by the volume growth in Walkers, Gamesa and
Poland and effective net pricing at Sabritas and Gamesa. Acquisitions
contributed 1 percentage point to sales growth. Weaker foreign currencies in
Brazil and the United Kingdom decreased net sales by 4 percentage points.

Operating profit increased
17%, led by solid results from Sabritas, Walkers, Poland and Gamesa, partially
offset by a decrease in Argentina as a result of macroeconomic conditions. The
weaker foreign currencies, primarily in Brazil and the United Kingdom, decreased
operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.

2000 vs. 1999

Kilo volume increased 10%,
excluding the impact of the fifty-third week. This growth was primarily driven
by a 13% increase in salty snack kilos and a 9% increase in other non-snack food
kilos. The salty snack growth was led by double-digit increases at Sabritas, our
European and Latin American joint ventures and Walkers. The other non-snack food
growth was led by our business in Brazil. Acquisitions did not significantly
impact the kilo growth. Kilo volume growth including the fifty-third week was
11%.


Comparable net sales
increased 13% primarily driven by the volume growth at Sabritas, Walkers and in
Turkey, largely due to promotional programs, and effective net pricing at Gamesa
and Sabritas. The net impact from acquisitions/divestitures contributed 2
percentage points to sales growth. Weaker foreign currencies, primarily in the
United Kingdom and Australia, decreased net sales growth by 3 percentage points.

Comparable operating profit
grew 17% reflecting strong operating performances at Sabritas, Gamesa and in
Turkey. The net impact from acquisitions/divestitures decreased operating profit
growth by 3 percentage points. Weaker foreign currencies, primarily in the
United Kingdom, decreased operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.

Worldwide
Beverages

Our worldwide beverage

2001 vs. 2000

Concentrate shipments and
equivalents increased 4%, excluding the impact of the fifty-third week in 2000.
This increase was primarily driven by high single-digit growth in Mountain Dew
reflecting the introduction of Code Red, strong growth in Sierra Mist and
Aquafina, the acquisition of SoBe and the launch of Dole. These gains were
partially offset by a low single-digit decline in trademark Pepsi, which was
mitigated, in part, by the successful launch of Pepsi Twist, and a double-digit
decline in Slice reflecting the strong growth of Sierra Mist. Bottler case sales
volume increased 4%. The carbonated soft drink portfolio and the acquisition of
SoBe each contributed 1 percentage point to both concentrate shipments and
equivalents and bottler case sales growth.

Comparable net sales
increased 18% primarily due to the increased volume and higher effective net
pricing. The acquisition of SoBe and our new products Dole, Mountain Dew Code
Red, Sierra Mist and Pepsi Twist, accounted for the majority of the volume
growth. These gains were partially offset by increased customer support. SoBe
and Dole are sold as finished product to our bottling system. Accordingly, net
sales growth was accelerated due to their significantly higher price per unit.
The SoBe acquisition contributed 7 percentage points to net sales growth.

Operating profit increased
13% primarily due to the increased volume and higher effective net pricing.
These gains were partially offset by the increased advertising and marketing
expenses related to bottler funding and other programs, increased general and
administrative expenses and the increased customer support. General and
administrative expenses grew at a significantly faster rate than sales, while
advertising and marketing expenses grew at a significantly slower rate. The SoBe
acquisition reduced operating profit growth by 4 percentage points.

2000 vs. 1999

Bottler case sales volume
increased 1% driven by double-digit growth in Aquafina and distribution gains
from Fruitworks. In addition, the introduction of Sierra Mist and low
single-digit growth in Diet Pepsi contributed to the increase. These gains were
partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Pepsi and double-digit
declines in Pepsi One and Lemon Lime Slice. Concentrate shipments were in line
with bottler case sales. On a fifty-three week basis, concentrate shipments
increased 1.3%.

Comparable net sales
increased 8%. Higher concentrate and fountain pricing and higher Aquafina
royalties contributed 8 percentage points of growth, and the increased volume,
including the launch of Sierra Mist and our new Dole juice product, contributed
2 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by increased customer
support. The fifty-third week enhanced reported net sales growth by 1 percentage
point.

Comparable operating profit
increased 9% primarily due to the higher concentrate pricing, increased volume
and the higher Aquafina royalties. These increases were partially offset by
higher advertising and marketing expenses, increased customer support and
increased general and administrative expenses.

2001 vs. 2000

Volume grew 4% excluding
the impact of the fifty-third week in 2000. This growth was led by three new
Gatorade flavors and double-digit growth in Tropicana Pure Premium nutritionals,
offset by low double-digit declines in Tropicana Season’s Best.

Comparable net sales
increased 5% due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing for
Gatorade.

Comparable operating profit
increased 7% due to the volume gains, the higher effective net pricing and lower
general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by
higher promotional allowances and higher manufacturing costs primarily resulting
from lower fruit yields, higher energy costs and lower production leverage.

2000 vs. 1999

Volume grew 10% due to the
introduction of two new Gatorade flavors, multiple packs and expanded
distribution. Continued double-digit growth in Tropicana Pure Premium, including
strong double-digit growth in Tropicana Pure Premium nutritionals and blends,
also contributed to this growth. On a fifty-three week basis, volume increased
11%.

Comparable net sales
increased 10% primarily due to the volume gains. Lower effective net pricing at
Tropicana was substantially offset by increased pricing of selected Gatorade
products.

Comparable operating profit
increased 15% primarily due to the volume gains. These gains were partially
offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses, including costs to
support the launch of Propel fitness water, and increased packaging and
transportation costs.

2001 vs. 2000

Volume increased 4.5% due
to broad-based increases led by Russia, China and Brazil. These increases were
partially offset by pricing related declines in Mexico and Saudi Arabia coupled
with a macroeconomic decline in Turkey. Total carbonated soft drink concentrate
shipments to franchisees, including those bottlers in which we own an equity
interest, grew 3% while their bottler case sales grew at about the same rate.

Net sales increased 2%.
This increase was primarily due to the volume gains and higher effective net
pricing, partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. The net
unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, Brazil and Egypt,
reduced net sales growth by 4 percentage points.

Operating profit increased
31% primarily reflecting the volume gains and higher effective net pricing,
partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. The net
unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, reduced operating
profit growth by 12 percentage points. Overall margin improvements contributed
to operating profit growth.

2000 vs. 1999

Volume increased 6%. This
reflects broad-based increases led by a doubling of volume in Russia, where
volumes recovered from the effects of the 1998 ruble devaluation. Volume growth
was also driven by double-digit growth in China, India and Thailand and by
growth in Mexico. Total carbonated soft drink concentrate shipments to
franchisees, including those bottlers in which we own an equity interest, grew
2% while their bottler case sales grew at a higher rate.

Comparable net sales
increased 4% due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing, partially
offset by a broad-based net unfavorable foreign currency impact led by Europe.
The net unfavorable foreign currency impact reduced net sales growth by 5
percentage points.

Operating profit increased
56% primarily reflecting the volume gains and higher effective net pricing,
partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in
Europe, higher advertising and marketing and higher general and administrative
expenses to support top-line growth.

Volume decreased 1% driven
by declines in ready-to-eat cereals and bulk cornmeal and oats products, largely
offset by growth in hot cereals. The hot cereals growth resulted primarily from
new products and flavor varieties.

Net sales increased 1%
primarily due to higher effective net pricing reflecting a mix shift to higher
priced products, as well as price increases for cereals. This increase was
offset by the lower overall volume.

Operating profit increased
6% reflecting the higher effective net pricing from growth in higher priced
products and the price increases in cereals.

2000 vs. 1999

Volume declined 1% driven
by price competition in the ready-to-eat cereal category, partially offset by
gains from the introduction of new varieties of hot cereals.

Net sales declined 1% primarily due to the lower overall volume.

Operating profit increased
8% reflecting the higher-margin hot cereals volume growth, productivity gains
and lower marketing spending. Advertising and marketing expenses declined at a
faster rate than sales.


CONSOLIDATED
CASH FLOWS

Operating cash flow for
2001 was $2.9 billion compared with $3.1 billion for 2000. Operating cash flow
primarily reflects externally reported net cash provided by operating activities
of $4.2 billion, excluding after-tax net interest payments and the cash payments
for merger-related costs and other impairment restructuring charges, less
capital spending, sales of property, plant and equipment and other net investing
activity. Our 2001 operating cash flow reflects a $421 million contribution to
our U.S. pension plans compared to a $70 million contribution in 2000. The 2001
payment was made following a review of our anticipated future sources and uses
of cash. We do not expect to make a cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans
in 2002. Additionally, in 2001, we received tax refunds of $62 million versus
$145 million in 2000.

As shown in our

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

, our 2001 cash and cash equivalents
decreased $355 million to $683 million reflecting cash used for investing and
financing activities primarily funded from net cash provided by operations. The
cash used in investing activities reflects capital spending, net purchases of
short-term investments, the acquisition of SoBe and the contribution to our
pension plans. The cash used in financing activities reflects share repurchases
and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock
options and the net proceeds of $524 million from the issuance of shares in
connection with the merger with Quaker. We issued 13.2 million shares of our
repurchased common stock to qualify for pooling-of-interests accounting
treatment.

Our 2000 cash and cash
equivalents decreased $208 million to $1 billion reflecting cash used for
financing and investing activities primarily funded from net cash provided by
operations. The cash used in financing activities reflects share repurchases,
dividend payments and net long-term debt payments, partially offset by proceeds
from the exercise of stock options. The cash used in investing activities
reflects capital spending and net purchases of short-term investments.

Common Share Repurchases

2.6%         2.4%

Quaker repurchased common shares totaling $242 million in 2000 and $373 million in 1999.


Subsequent to our merger
with Quaker, we repurchased 35 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
$1.7 billion under the emergency and exemptive orders from the Securities and
Exchange Commission aimed at facilitating the reopening of the U.S. equities
market on September 17, 2001, following the September 11th terrorist attacks.
Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion worth of
our common stock during the terms of the orders. Repurchases under the orders
did not compromise our ability to account for the merger with Quaker as a
pooling-of-interests. All authorizations for share repurchases have been
rescinded as a result of the PepsiCo and Quaker merger.

LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our strong cash-generating
capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets
throughout the world. Our principle source of liquidity is operating cash flows,
which are derived from net sales. Macroeconomic conditions may impact the demand
for and pricing of our products. Our debt rating of A1 from Moody’s and A
from Standard & Poor’s contributes to our accessibility to global
capital markets. These ratings reflect our strong operating cash flows and
include the impact of the cash flows and debt of our anchor bottlers. We have
maintained these healthy ratings since 1989 demonstrating the stability of our
operating cash flows.

At year-end 2001, we
maintained $750 million of revolving credit facilities. Of the $750 million,
approximately $375 million expires in June 2002 with the remaining $375 million
expiring in June 2006. Annually, these facilities are extendable for an
additional year upon the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions.
The credit facilities exist largely to support issuances of short-term debt and
remain unused at year-end 2001. At year-end 2001, $375 million of short-term
borrowings were reclassified as long-term, reflecting our intent and ability,
through the existence of the unused credit facilities, to refinance these
borrowings on a long-term basis.

Quaker integration costs
will require cash, of which $228 million was paid in 2001. We expect the balance
will be paid in 2002 and 2003.

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 – Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

On August 2, 2001, we
completed our merger transaction, which resulted in The Quaker Oats Company
(Quaker) becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo. As a result, we restated
all prior period consolidated financial statements presented to reflect the
combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows of both
companies as if they had always been merged. See

Note 2

.

The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Tabular dollars are in
millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per
share amounts, assume dilution unless noted, and are based on unrounded amounts.
Certain reclassifications were made to the 2000 and 1999 amounts to conform to
the 2001 presentation.

Items Affecting Comparability

Our fiscal year ends on the
last Saturday in December and, as a result, a fifty-third week is added every
five or six years. The fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 consisted of
fifty-three weeks. The fifty-third week increased 2000 net sales by an estimated
$294 million, operating profit by an estimated $62 million and net income by an
estimated $44 million or $0.02 per share. See

Note 21

for the impact on our
business segments.

The consolidated financial
statements subsequent to the dates of the bottling transactions described in

Note 10

are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements presented
for prior periods as certain bottling operations that were previously
consolidated are now accounted for under the equity method. In addition, the
merger costs described in

Note 2

, other impairment and restructuring charges
described in

Note 3

, and the income tax adjustment described in

Note 14

affect
comparability.

Principles of Consolidation

The financial statements
include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and its controlled
affiliates. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which we exercise significant
influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity method. Our
definition of control for majority owned affiliates considers the exercisability
of the minority interest rights, and consolidation would be precluded to the
extent that the minority interest holds substantive participating rights. Our
share of the net income or loss of unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by
the equity method is included in consolidated net income.

Issuances of Subsidiary Stock

The issuance of stock by
one of our subsidiaries to third parties reduces our proportionate ownership
interest in the subsidiary. Unless the issuance of such stock is part of a
broader corporate reorganization, we recognize a gain or loss equal to the
difference between the issuance price per share and our carrying amount per
share. Such gain or loss, net of the related tax, is recognized in consolidated
net income when the transaction occurs.

F - 8

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when
products are delivered to customers consistent with sales terms. Sales terms
generally do not allow a right of return.

Marketing Costs

Marketing costs are
reported in selling, general and administrative expenses and include costs of
advertising, promotional programs and other marketing activities. Advertising
expenses were $1.7 billion in 2001 and 2000 and $1.6 billion in 1999. Deferred
advertising expense classified as prepaid expenses in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet was $111 million in 2001 and $127 million in 2000. Deferred advertising
costs are expensed in the year first used and consist of:

•

media and personal service prepayments,

•

promotional materials in inventory, and

•

production costs of future media advertising.

We classify promotional
payments to customers, including cooperative advertising, as either a reduction
of net sales or as marketing costs. During 2000 and 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of
certain promotional payments, including consideration from a vendor to a
reseller or another party that purchases the vendor’s products. EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of
the Vendor’s Products,

was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier
pronouncements. Primarily effective for 2002, adoption of EITF 01-9 will reduce
our net sales by $3.4 billion in 2001, $3.1 billion in 2000 and $2.9 billion in
1999, with selling, general and administrative expenses reduced by the same
amounts.

Distribution Costs

Distribution costs are
reported in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses
depending on the distribution method, and include the costs of shipping and
handling activities. Shipping and handling expenses classified as selling,
general and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in 2001, $2.5 billion in
2000 and $2.4 billion in 1999.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development
costs are expensed in the year incurred. Research and development costs were
$206 million in 2001, $207 million in 2000 and $187 million in 1999.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure stock-based
compensation cost as the excess of the quoted market price of PepsiCo common
stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock
(exercise price). Our policy is to generally grant stock options with an
exercise price equal to the stock price at the date of grant, and accordingly,
no compensation cost is recognized. Under certain prior incentive programs,
compensation cost for cash payments expected to be paid to employees in lieu of
stock options was based on the grant date value and recognized over the vesting
period of the award.

F - 9

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Our pension plans cover
substantially all full-time U.S. employees and certain international employees.
Benefits depend on years of service and earnings or are based on stated amounts
for each year of service. Our postretirement plans provide medical and life
insurance benefits principally to U.S. retirees and their dependents. Employees
are eligible for benefits if they meet age and service requirements and qualify
for retirement benefits. Plans generally use a measurement date of September 30.
The pre-merger Quaker plans used a measurement date of December 31. Prior
service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining
service period of employees expected to receive benefits.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

We manage risks associated
with commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates our stock price
and may use derivatives to hedge these risks. Hedging transactions are executed
in accordance with our policies. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivative
instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not use
derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Any change in the
value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite
change in the value of the underlying hedged items. All derivative instruments
are recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The fair value
of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices. There
is no significant concentration of credit risk or activity with any of the
counterparties.

Using qualifying criteria
defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

derivative
instruments are designated and accounted for as either fair value or cash flow
hedges. Our evaluations of hedge effectiveness are subject to assumptions based
on the terms and timing of the underlying exposures. For a fair value hedge,
both the effective and ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the
derivative instrument, along with an adjustment to the carrying amount of the
hedged item for fair value changes attributable to the hedged risk, are
recognized in earnings. For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of a
derivative instrument that is highly effective are deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss until the underlying hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately. If a
fair value or cash flow hedge was to cease to qualify for hedge accounting or be
terminated, it would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value
until settled, but hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively. If a
forecasted transaction were no longer probable of occurring, amounts previously
deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income would be recognized
immediately in earnings.

We are subject to market
risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover
increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate. We manage this risk primarily through the use
of fixed-price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and
derivative instruments. Derivative instruments, including futures, options and
swaps, are used to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated
commodity purchases, primarily corn, oats, natural gas, heating oil, vegetable
oil and packaging materials. Our use of derivative instruments is not
significant to our commodity purchases. Derivative instruments designated as
hedges of anticipated commodity purchases are accounted for generally as cash
flow hedges. The earnings impact from commodity hedges is classified as either
cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses consistent with
the expense classification of the underlying hedged items.

F - 10

International operations
constitute about one-fifth of our annual business segment operating profit.
Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in foreign
exchange rates, primarily the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, euro
and Brazilian real, which principally impacts the translation of our
international operating profit into U.S. dollars. On occasion, we may enter into
derivative financial instruments, as necessary, to reduce the effect of foreign
exchange rate changes. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives
centrally. Derivative instruments designated as foreign exchange hedges are
generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The earnings impact from these
hedges is classified as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses consistent with the expense classification of the
underlying hedged items.

We centrally manage our
debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,
tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use interest rate and
currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific
debt issuances, with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs.
These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that
they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity
date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the
related debt. Our credit risk related to interest rate and currency swaps is
considered low because such swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy
counterparties, are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short
duration. Interest rate and currency swaps are designated as hedges of
underlying fixed rate obligations and accounted for as fair value hedges. The
earnings impact from these hedges is classified as interest expense.

The portion of our deferred
compensation liability, which is based on our stock price, is subject to market
risk. Prepaid forward contracts with financial institutions are used to hedge
this risk and are accounted for as natural hedges. The earnings impact from
these hedges is classified as selling, general and administrative expenses
consistent with the expense classification of the deferred compensation
liability. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 133, the earnings impact from these
equity derivative contracts was classified as interest income.

The cash flows related to
the above derivative instruments are classified in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows in a manner consistent with those of the transactions being hedged.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash equivalents represent
funds temporarily invested with original maturities of three months or less. All
other investment portfolios are primarily classified as short-term investments

Inventories

Inventories are valued at
the lower of cost (computed on the average, first-in, first-out (FIFO) or
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method) or at net realizable value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a
straight-line basis. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 15 to 40 years. Machinery and
equipment (including fleet) are depreciated over their estimated useful lives,
generally ranging from 5 to 15 years.

F - 11

Intangible Assets

Goodwill, the excess of our
investments in unconsolidated affiliates over our equity in the underlying net
assets of these investments, and trademarks and brands are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 20
to 40 years. Other identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 20 years.

Asset Impairment

All long-lived assets,
including goodwill, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other
identifiable intangibles, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of
undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset
is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information
available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting
estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to
estimate discounted future cash flows.

The depreciation or
amortization periods for long-lived assets to be held and used are periodically
evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred that
warrant revision to the useful lives.

Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recorded
to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax
assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
in future years. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we
have taken a tax deduction, but have not yet recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax
assets where the amount of expected future taxable income from operations does
not support the realization of these deferred tax assets.

Deferred tax liabilities
are not recognized for temporary differences related to investments in foreign
subsidiaries and in unconsolidated foreign affiliates that are essentially
permanent in duration. It would not be practicable to determine the amount of
any such deferred tax liabilities.

Commitments and Contingencies

We are subject to various
claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes and environmental matters,
as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We
recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable
and estimable.

Accounting Changes

In July 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 141,

Business Combinations.

SFAS 141 eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies
the application of the purchase accounting method. The elimination of the
pooling-of-interests method is effective for transactions initiated after June
30, 2001. The remaining provisions of SFAS 141 are effective for transactions
accounted for using the purchase method that are completed after June 30, 2001.
Since our merger with Quaker (see

Note 2

) was initiated in December 2000 and our
acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC (see

Note 4

) was completed in
January 2001, adoption of this statement does not have an impact on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

F - 12

In July 2001, the FASB also
issued SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

SFAS 142 eliminates the
current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses
impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS 142
applies to existing goodwill and intangible assets, as well as to transactions
completed after the statement’s effective date. SFAS 142 is effective for
2002. Adoption of SFAS 142 will increase income before taxes by approximately
$87 million in 2002 reflecting the cessation of goodwill amortization and
changes in the lives of other intangibles. The required transition impairment
evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges.

In June 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

. SFAS 143
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. It requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. We are currently assessing SFAS 143 and the
impact that adoption, in 2003, will have on our consolidated financial
statements.

In August 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

. SFAS 144 establishes a single model for the impairment of long-lived
assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more
disposal transactions. SFAS 144 is effective for 2002. Adoption will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 –
Merger of PepsiCo and The Quaker Oats Company

Under the Quaker merger
agreement dated December 2, 2000, Quaker shareholders received 2.3 shares of
PepsiCo common stock in exchange for each share of Quaker common stock,
including a cash payment for fractional shares. We issued approximately 306
million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common
stock of Quaker.

In connection with the
merger transaction, we sold the global rights in our All Sport beverage brand to
The Monarch Company, Inc. of Atlanta. As part of the terms of the sale, we
agreed that, for 10 years after the Quaker transaction closing date, we would
not distribute Gatorade sports drink through our bottling system in the United
States and would not include Gatorade with Pepsi-Cola products in certain
marketing or promotional arrangements covering specific distribution channels.

The merger was accounted
for as a tax-free transaction and as a pooling-of-interests. As a result, all
prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to
include the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of both
companies as if they had always been combined. Certain reclassifications were
made to conform the presentation of the financial statements, and the fiscal
calendar and certain interim reporting policies were also conformed. There were
no material transactions between pre-merger PepsiCo and Quaker.

F - 13

The results of operations
of the separate companies and the combined company for the most recent interim
period prior to the merger and for the years presented in the consolidated
financial statements are as follows:

Adjustments reflect the impact of changing Quaker’s fiscal
calendar to conform to PepsiCo’s and conforming the accounting policies of
the two companies applicable to interim reporting. These changes have no impact
on full year net sales or net income.

During 2001, we recognized
costs of $356 million associated with our merger with Quaker. The components of
these merger-related costs were as follows:

Transaction costs were
incurred to complete the merger and consist primarily of fees and expenses for
investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, SEC filing fees, stock exchange
listing fees and financial printing and other related charges.

Integration costs represent
incremental one-time merger-related costs. Such costs include consulting fees
and expenses, expenses for accelerated vesting under change-in-control
provisions, information system integration costs and employee-related costs.

The restructuring charges
primarily reflect termination costs for approximately 580 corporate, sales,
distribution, manufacturing, research and marketing employees. Employee
termination costs include retirement benefit costs, severance costs and expenses
associated with change-in-control provisions of pre-merger employment contracts.
As of December 29, 2001, approximately 380 of the terminations have occurred.
The terminations are expected to be completed during 2002.

We expect to incur additional costs to integrate the two companies.

2001 and 2000

The 2001 and 2000 other
impairment and restructuring charges relate to a three-year supply chain
reconfiguration project announced in 1999 to upgrade and optimize Quaker’s
manufacturing and distribution capabilities across all of its North American
businesses.

The asset impairment
charges primarily reflect the reduction in the carrying value of the land,
buildings and production machinery and equipment to their estimated fair market
value based on analyses of the liquidation values of similar assets. The
restructuring charges primarily included severance and termination benefits for
approximately 1,000 employees and other shutdown costs. No future charges are
expected on this project.

F-15


The 1999 other impairment and restructuring charges of $73 million were comprised of the following:

•

A charge of $65 million, for asset impairment of $37 million and
restructuring charges of $28 million, related to the closure of three plants and
impairment of equipment at Frito-Lay North America. The asset impairment charges
primarily reflected the reduction in the carrying value of the land and
buildings to their estimated fair market value based on selling prices for
comparable real estate, less costs to sell, and the write off of the net book
value of equipment which could not be redeployed. The plant closures were
completed during 1999. The majority of these assets were either disposed of or
abandoned in 1999. The restructuring charges of $28 million primarily included
severance costs and plant closing costs.

•

A charge of $8 million, for asset impairment of $5 million and
restructuring charges of $3 million, related to the previously discussed Quaker
supply chain reconfiguration project. The charge included costs to consolidate
several cereal manufacturing lines and employee-related costs.

The employee-related costs
for 1999 of $20 million primarily included severance and early retirement
benefits for approximately 930 employees. Substantially all of the terminations
occurred during 1999.

Note 4 - Acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC

On January 5, 2001, we completed the acquisition of South Beach Beverage  Company,  LLC for  approximately  $337 million in cash. As of
December 29, 2001,  we own a 93%  interest in the newly  formed South Beach  Beverage  Company,  Inc.  (SoBe).  SoBe  manufactures  and
markets an innovative line of alternative  non-carbonated  beverages including fruit blends, energy drinks,  dairy-based drinks, exotic
teas and other  beverages  with herbal  ingredients,  which prior to our  acquisition  were  distributed  under license by a network of
independent distributors, primarily in the United States.

Note 5 - Net Income Per Common Share

Basic net income per common share is  calculated by dividing net income  available to common  shareholders  by the weighted  average of
common shares  outstanding  during the period.  Diluted net income per common share is calculated  using the weighted average of common
shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of convertible stock or stock options.

Identifiable intangible assets possess economic value but lack physical substance. These assets
primarily arise from the allocation of purchase prices of businesses acquired.  Amounts assigned to such identifiable intangibles are based on independent
appraisals or internal estimates. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price after allocation to all identifiable net assets.

The above amounts are presented net of accumulated amortization of $1 billion at year-end 2001 and
$0.9 billion at year-end 2000.

Note 10 - Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

During 1999, we completed a series of transactions creating our anchor bottlers that manufacture, sell and
distribute carbonated and non-carbonated Pepsi-Cola beverages under master bottling agreements with us.

In April 1999, certain wholly-owned bottling businesses, referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),
completed an initial public offering with PepsiCo retaining a direct noncontrolling ownership interest of 35.5%. We received $5.5 billion of debt proceeds as settlement of pre-existing intercompany amounts due to us and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion ($476 million after-tax or $0.26 per
share) as a result of the transaction. In May, we combined certain other bottling operations with Whitman Corporation to create new Whitman, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 38%. The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss to PepsiCo of $206 million or $0.11 per share. In July, we
combined certain other bottling operations with PepCom Industries, Inc.  retaining a noncontrolling interest of 35% in the combined entity renamed Pepsi Bottling Ventures, LLC. This transaction was accounted for as a nonmonetary
exchange for book purposes. However, a portion of the transaction was taxable and resulted in income tax expense of $25 million or $0.01 per share. In October, we formed a business venture with Pohlad Companies, a Pepsi-Cola franchisee, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 24% in the venture’s principal operating subsidiary, PepsiAmericas, Inc. The
transaction was structured as a fair value exchange with no resulting gain or loss.

In December 2000, Whitman merged with PepsiAmericas. At year-end 2001, we owned approximately 37% of the
combined company. As part of the merger, we participate in an earn-out option whereby we may receive additional shares when certain performance targets are
met. Effective January 2001, the name of the combined company was changed to PepsiAmericas.

PBG

In addition to approximately 38% of PBG’s outstanding common stock that we own at year-end
2001, we own 100% of PBG’s class B common stock and approximately 7% of the equity of Bottling Group, LLC, PBG’s principal operating subsidiary. This
gives us economic ownership of approximately 42% of PBG’s combined operations.

Related Party Transactions

Our significant related
party transactions involve our investments in unconsolidated bottling
affiliates. We sell concentrate to these affiliates that is used in the
production of carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages. We also sell
certain finished goods and we receive royalties for the use of our trademark for
certain products. The affiliates purchase sweeteners and certain other raw
materials through us. The raw material purchases on behalf of these bottling
affiliates, related payments to suppliers and collections from the bottlers are
not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We also provide certain
administrative and other services to these bottling affiliates under negotiated
fee arrangements.

Further, because we share a
common business objective with these bottling affiliates of increasing the
availability and consumption of Pepsi-Cola beverages, we provide various forms
of marketing support to or on behalf of them to promote our beverages. This
support covers a variety of initiatives, including marketplace support,
marketing programs, capital equipment and shared media expense. Based on the
objective of the programs and initiatives, we record marketing support as an
adjustment to net sales or as selling, general and administrative expenses.

and


for
a discussion of our use of interest rate and currency swaps, our management of
the inherent credit risk and fair value information related to debt and interest
rate and currency swaps.

F - 22

Interest Rate Swaps

The following table
indicates the notional amount and weighted average interest rates of interest
rate swaps outstanding at year-end 2001 and 2000. The weighted average variable
interest rates that we pay, which are primarily linked to either commercial
paper or LIBOR rates, are based on rates as of the respective balance sheet date
and are subject to change.

Weighted average pay rate.....................

4.9%

The terms of the interest
rate swaps match the terms of the debt they modify. The swaps terminate at
various dates through 2011. At year-end 2001, approximately 52% of total debt,
including the effects of the associated interest rate swaps, was exposed to
variable interest rates, compared to 55% in 2000. In addition to variable rate
long-term debt, all short-term borrowings are categorized as variable for
purposes of this measure.

Currency Swaps

We entered into currency
swaps to hedge our currency exposure on certain non-U.S. dollar denominated debt
upon issuance of such debt. The terms of the currency swaps matched the terms of
the debt they modify. We have no currency swaps at December 29, 2001.

At year-end 2000, the
foreign currency risk that related to debt denominated in Swiss francs and
Luxembourg francs with an aggregate carrying amount of $122 million was hedged
by currency swaps. The payables under related currency swaps were $43 million,
resulting in an effective U.S. dollar liability of $165 million with a weighted
average interest rate of 6.6%.

Revolving Credit Facilities

At year-end 2001, we
maintained $750 million of revolving credit facilities. Of the $750 million,
approximately $375 million expires in June 2002 with the remaining $375 million
expiring in June 2006. The credit facilities exist largely to support issuances
of short-term debt and remain unused at year-end 2001. Annually, these
facilities are extendable an additional year upon the mutual consent of PepsiCo
and the lending institutions. These facilities are subject to normal banking
terms and conditions.

The reclassification of
short-term borrowings to long-term debt reflects our intent and ability, through
the existence of the unused credit facilities, to refinance these borrowings on
a long-term basis.

Long-term debt outstanding at December 29, 2001, matures as follows:

2002        2003        2004        2005         2006  Thereafter

F - 23

Note 13 -
Derivative and Financial Instruments

On December 31, 2000, we
adopted SFAS 133. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that we recognize
all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The adoption of SFAS
133 on December 31, 2000 increased assets by approximately $12 million and
liabilities by approximately $10 million with approximately $3 million
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and a loss of less than $1
million recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accumulated other
comprehensive loss included net accumulated derivative losses of $18 million as
of December 29, 2001.

Cash Flow Hedges

During the next twelve
months, we expect to reclassify losses of approximately $1 million from
accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. All cash flow hedges at
December 29, 2001 are for periods of less than two years. Ineffectiveness
resulting from cash flow hedging activities was not material to our results of
operations. No cash flow hedges were discontinued during the year ended December
29, 2001 as a result of anticipated transactions that are no longer probable of
occurring.

Fair Value Hedges

Ineffectiveness resulting
from fair value hedging activities was not material to our results of
operations. All components of each derivative’s gain or loss are included
in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In 2001, there were no hedged firm
commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges. See

Note 12

for the
notional amounts, related interest rates and maturities of the interest rate and
currency swaps.

Prepaid Forward Contracts

The change in the fair
value of these equity derivative contracts resulted in $1 million of expense
during 2001, $19 million of income during 2000 and $6 million of expense during
1999. These changes in fair value were substantially offset by opposite changes
in the amount of the underlying deferred compensation liability.

Because of the short
maturity of cash equivalents and short-term investments, the carrying amounts
approximate fair values. Short-term investments consist primarily of debt
securities and have been classified as held-to-maturity. The fair values of
commodity contracts, debt, debt-related derivatives and foreign exchange
derivatives were estimated using market quotes and calculations based on market
rates. We have unconditionally guaranteed $2.3 billion of Bottling Group,
LLC’s long-term debt. The guarantee had a fair value of $59 million at
December 29, 2001 and $66 million at December 30, 2000 based on market rates.

Employee Stock Options

SharePower

SharePower stock options
are granted to essentially all full-time employees. SharePower options generally
have a 10-year term. Beginning in 1998, the number of SharePower options granted
is based on each employee’s annual earnings and tenure. These options
generally become exercisable after three years. Prior to 1998, the number of
options granted was based on each employee’s annual earnings and generally
became exercisable ratably over five years.

LTIP

All senior management and
certain middle management awards are made under the LTIP. Under the LTIP, awards
are generally based on a multiple of base salary. The options generally become
exercisable at the end of three years and have a 10-year term. In 2001, the
entire award was made in stock options with an exercise price equal to the
average stock price on the date of the award. From 1998 through 2000, two-thirds
of the award consisted of stock options with the balance paid in stock options
or cash. At the date of these awards, the employee selected whether the
remaining one-third of the award will be granted in stock options or paid in
cash at the end of three years. The number of options granted or the cash
payment, if any, depended on the attainment of prescribed performance goals over
the three-year measurement period. If stock options were selected, they will be
granted with an exercise price equal to the average stock price on the date of
the grant, will vest immediately and have a 10-year term. If a cash payment is
selected, one dollar of cash will be received for every four dollars of the
award. Amounts expensed for expected cash payments were $64.0 million in 2001,
$36.7 million in 2000 and $17.9 million in 1999. At year-end 2001, 57 million
shares were available for grants under the LTIP.

SOIP

Grants under the SOIP are
available to middle management employees. Under the SOIP, an employee generally
receives an award based on a multiple of base salary. The options generally
become exercisable at the end of three years and have a 10-year term. The entire
award is made in stock options with an exercise price equal to the average stock
price on the date of the award. At year-end 2001, 39 million shares were
available for grants under the SOIP.

Quaker LTIP

Grants under the Quaker
LTIP were made to officers and other key employees. This program provided for
benefits to be awarded in a variety of ways, with stock options being used most
frequently. Approximately 12 million shares of Quaker common stock were
authorized for grant under the Quaker LTIP. Stock options were granted for the
purchase of common stock at a price not less than the fair market value on the
date of grant. Options were generally exercisable after one or more years and
expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant. This plan provided that,
in the event of a change in control

F - 28

of Quaker, stock options
become exercisable. Accordingly, upon approval by the Quaker shareholders of the
merger, unvested options under this plan were vested. Upon consummation of the
merger, these options were converted to PepsiCo stock options.

Deferred Compensation - ESOP

Quaker established an ESOP
for the benefit of its employees to issue debt and to use the proceeds of such
debt to acquire shares of stock for future allocation to ESOP participants. The
final ESOP award was made in June 2001. The ESOP borrowings are included in
long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As annual contributions were
made to the ESOP, these contributions, along with the dividends accumulated on
the common and preferred stock held by the ESOP, were used to repay the
outstanding loans. As the loans were repaid, common and preferred stock were
allocated to ESOP participants and deferred compensation was reduced by the
amount of the principal payments on the loans.

In 1999, as a result of the
bottling transactions, $717 million of pension benefit obligation and $205
million of postretirement benefit obligations were assumed by bottling
affiliates. In addition, bottling affiliate plans assumed ownership of $659
million of pension assets. The net gain on the bottling transactions includes a
curtailment/settlement net loss of $52 million.

The discount rate
assumption used to compute the postretirement benefit obligation at year end was
7.5% in 2001 and 7.8% in 2000.

Pension Assets

The pension plan assets are
principally invested in stocks and bonds. These assets include approximately 4.7
million shares of PepsiCo common stock with a fair value of $227 million in 2001
and $214 million in 2000. Subsequent to the measurement date of September 30,
2001, 0.8 million shares of PepsiCo common stock were purchased and, during
2000, 1.8 million shares were sold. A one-percentage point decrease in our
expected return on assets would have increased our net periodic pension cost by
approximately $31 million in 2001.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

An average increase of 7.5%
in the cost of covered postretirement medical benefits is assumed for 2002. This
average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 4.5% in 2008 and
thereafter. Generally, our costs are capped at a specified dollar amount.

F - 32

Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement
medical plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care costs would
have the following effects:

Note 20 -
Commitments, Contingencies and Leases

Contingent liabilities
primarily reflect guarantees to support financial arrangements of certain
unconsolidated affiliates, including the unconditional guarantee for $2.3
billion of Bottling Group, LLC’s long-term debt. We believe that the
ultimate liability, if any, in excess of amounts already recognized arising from
such claims or contingencies is not likely to have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

In March 2000, we entered
into a ten-year lease for office space to be constructed in Chicago, Illinois.
The new Chicago office is currently in development and is expected to be
completed in 2002. Our obligations under the lease are contingent upon
completion of the building and satisfaction of certain other obligations by the
lessor.

Certain equipment and
operating properties are rented under non-cancelable and cancelable operating
leases and may provide for renewal options or escalation clauses. Total rent
expense under operating leases was $165 million in 2001, $171 million in 2000
and $137 million in 1999.

The following is a schedule of future minimum
annual rentals on non-cancelable operating leases, in effect as of December 29,
2001:

Note 21 - Business Segments

In early 1999, in
contemplation of the separation from PepsiCo of our bottling operations, we
completed a reorganization of our beverage businesses and presented our
operating results for 1999 consistent with the new beverage organization.
Therefore, the results of previously consolidated bottling operations in which
we now own an equity interest through the applicable transaction closing dates
in 1999 are presented separately with the first quarter 1999 equity income or
loss of other unconsolidated bottling affiliates. From the applicable
transaction closing dates in 1999, the equity income of those previously
consolidated bottling operations and the equity income or loss of other
unconsolidated bottling affiliates from the second quarter of 1999 are presented
separately below operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The
combined results of our six ongoing reportable segments are referred to as New
PepsiCo. The North American segments include the United States and Canada.

F - 33

The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those described in

Note 1

. Merger-related costs and
other impairment and restructuring charges are not included in segment results.
All intersegment net sales and expenses are immaterial and have been eliminated
in computing net sales and operating profit.

(e)  Cash  dividends  declared per common share are those of pre-merger  PepsiCo
     prior to the effective date of the merger.

     those of PepsiCo prior to the effective date of the merger.

(g)  Fiscal year 2000  consisted  of  fifty-three  weeks and 1999  consisted  of
     fifty-two  weeks.  The impact for the fourth  quarter  and full year to net

Management’s
Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our
Shareholders:

Management is responsible
for the reliability of the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and include amounts based upon our estimates and
assumptions, as required. The financial statements have been audited by our
independent auditors, KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial
records and related data, including minutes of the meetings of the Board of
Directors and Committees of the Board. We believe that our representations to
the independent auditors are valid and appropriate.

Management maintains a
system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the
reliability of the financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from
unauthorized use or disposition. The system is supported by formal policies and
procedures, including an active Code of Conduct program intended to ensure
employees adhere to the highest standards of personal and professional
integrity. Our internal audit function monitors and reports on the adequacy of
and compliance with the internal control system, and appropriate actions are
taken to address significant control deficiencies and other opportunities for
improving the system as they are identified. The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors consists solely of directors who are not salaried employees and who
are, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, free from any relationship that
would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee member.
The Committee meets during the year with representatives of management,
including internal auditors and the independent accountants to review our
financial reporting process and our controls to safeguard assets. Both our
independent auditors and internal auditors have free access to the Audit
Committee.

Although no cost-effective
internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities, we believe
our controls as of December 29, 2001 provide reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are reliable and that our assets are reasonably
safeguarded.

Independent
Auditors’ Report

Board of Directors and Shareholders

PepsiCo, Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 and the related Consolidated Statements
of Income, Cash Flows and Common Shareholders’ Equity for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 29, 2001. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of PepsiCo, Inc.‘s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as
of December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 29, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

As a result of the bottling
deconsolidation in 1999 and the Tropicana acquisition late in 1998, the data

all information has been restated for 1997.
