PART I

Item 1.   Business

PepsiCo,  Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and was  reincorporated  in North Carolina in 1986.  PepsiCo is engaged in
the snack food,  soft drink and juice  businesses.  When used in this Report the terms “we”,  “us” and “our”  means PepsiCo and itsdivisions and subsidiaries.

In December  2000,  we  announced an  agreement  under which a  subsidiary  of PepsiCo will merge with The Quaker Oats Company
(“Quaker”) and Quaker will become a wholly-owned  subsidiary of PepsiCo.  Under the terms of the agreement,  which has been approved by
the Boards of  Directors  of both  PepsiCo  and  Quaker,  we will  exchange  2.3 shares of our stock for each share of Quaker,  up to a
maximum value of $105 for each Quaker share. The proposed merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including approval by
shareholders  of both companies and  regulatory  approvals.  On January 9, 2001, PepsiCo and Quaker filed a preliminary  S-4 joint proxy
statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2001.

Quaker is an  international  marketer of foods and beverages.  It manufactures  and markets  Gatorade active thirst  quencher,
which is the leading  sports drink in the United  States and Canada.  Quaker is also a major  participant  in the food  industry in the
United States and Canada and is a leading manufacturer of hot cereals, pancake syrups,  grain-based snacks, cornmeal,  hominy grits and
value-added  rice  products.  In  addition,  in the United  States,  Quaker is the  second-largest  manufacturer  of pancake  mixes and
value-added pasta products and is among the four largest  manufacturers of ready-to-eat  cereals.  Quaker  manufactures and markets its
products in many countries throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America.

In  January  2001,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of the  beverage  business  of  South  Beach  Beverage  Company,  LLC ("SoBe") for approximately $337 million.  SoBe manufactures and markets an innovative line of alternative  non-carbonated
beverages including fruit blends, energy drinks,  dairy-based drinks, exotic
teas and other  beverages  with herbal  ingredients,  which are  distributed  under license by a network of  independent  distributors,
primarily in the United States.

SNACK FOODS

Our domestic snack food business is conducted by Frito-Lay North America ("FLNA").  Our  international  snack food business is
described below under the heading  Frito-Lay  International  ("FLI").  FLI's geographic units are Frito-Lay  Europe/Middle  East/Africa
and Frito-Lay Latin America/Asia Pacific/Australia.

FLNA

FLNA  manufactures,  markets,  sells and distributes a varied line of salty and sweet snack foods throughout the United States
and Canada,  including LAY’S and RUFFLES brand potato chips, DORITOS and TOSTITOS brand tortilla chips,  CHEETOS brand  cheese-flavored
snacks,  FRITOS brand corn chips,  ROLD GOLD brand  pretzels,  WOW!  brand low fat and no fat  versions of potato and  tortilla  chips,
SUNCHIPS brand  multigrain  snacks, a variety of branded dips and salsas,  GRANDMA’S brand cookies and CRACKER JACK brand  candy-coated
popcorn.  FLNA also sells and distributes OH BOY! OBERTO brand meat snacks under an agreement with the Oberto Sausage Company.


FLNA's products are transported from  manufacturing  plants to our major  distribution  centers,  principally by company-owned
trucks.  FLNA utilizes a direct store delivery system,  whereby its sales force delivers the snacks directly from distribution  centers
to the store  shelf.  This system  permits  FLNA to work  closely with retail  trade  locations  and to be  responsive  to their needs.
Frito-Lay believes this form of distribution  allows it to have a marketing  advantage and is essential for the proper  distribution of
products with a short shelf life.

Frito-Lay  also develops the national  marketing,  promotion and  advertising  programs that support the Frito-Lay  brands and
brand image;  oversees the quality of the Frito-Lay  products;  develops new products and packaging and approves  packaging  suppliers;
and leads and coordinates selling efforts.

FLI

FLI’s products are available in 120 countries outside of the United States and Canada through company-owned businesses and
affiliated companies.  On most of the European continent, our snack food business is conducted through Snack Ventures Europe, a joint
venture between PepsiCo and General Mills, Inc., in which we own a 60% interest. In ten Latin America countries, our snack food
business is conducted through joint ventures between PepsiCo and Libracor, Ltd., a part of Venezuela's Empresas Polar Group.  We have
a 50% interest in these ventures, except in one country where we own a 70% interest.

FLI sells a variety of snack food products which appeal to local tastes including, for example, SABRITAS brand snack foods in Mexico, WALKERS brand snack foods in
the United Kingdom, SMITH’S brand snack foods in Australia, and GAMESA brand cookies and ALEGRO
brand sweet snacks in Mexico. In addition, many of our U.S. brands, such as LAY’S, RUFFLES, DORITOS, TOSTITOS, CHEETOS and FRITOS
brand salty snack foods, have been introduced  internationally.  Principal  international  markets include Mexico,  the United Kingdom,
Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia and South Africa.

FLI develops the marketing,  promotion and advertising  programs that support the local and Frito-Lay  brands and brand image;
oversees the quality of the Frito-Lay  products;  develops new products and packaging and approves packaging  suppliers;  and leads and
coordinates selling efforts.

BEVERAGES

Our soft drink business  operates as the Pepsi-Cola  Company and is comprised of two business units:  Pepsi-Cola North America
("PCNA") and Pepsi-Cola International ("PCI").

PCNA

PCNA  manufactures  concentrates of "Pepsi-Cola  Beverages" such as PEPSI,  PEPSI-COLA,  DIET PEPSI,  PEPSI ONE, MOUNTAIN DEW,
SLICE, MUG, FRUITWORKS and SIERRA  MIST for sale to franchised  bottlers in the United States and Canada. PCNA’s bottlers are
licensed, within defined territories, to manufacture, market, sell and distribute Pepsi-Cola Beverages and syrups. We have a minority
interest in 7 of these bottlers, including The Pepsi Bottling Group, PepsiAmericas and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC which distribute three
quarters of our North American volume.


PCNA also develops the national  marketing,  promotion and  advertising  programs that support the Pepsi-Cola  Beverage brands
and brand image;  oversees  the quality of the  Pepsi-Cola  Beverages;  develops new  products  and  packaging  and approves  packaging
suppliers; and leads and coordinates selling efforts for national fountain, supermarket and mass merchandising accounts.

The  Pepsi/Lipton  Tea  Partnership,  a joint  venture of PepsiCo and  Unilever  N.V.,  sells tea  concentrate  to  Pepsi-Cola
bottlers,  and develops and markets  ready-to-drink  tea products under the Lipton trademark,  including LIPTON BRISK and LIPTON’S ICED
TEA.  PepsiCo’s  partnership  with the Starbucks Corporation develops ready-to-drink coffee products, which are sold under the
Starbucks  FRAPPUCCINO  trademark and are  distributed by Pepsi-Cola  bottlers.  PCNA also licenses the processing and  distribution of
AQUAFINA bottled water.  In addition, PCNA manufactures and sells DOLE juice drinks for sale and distribution by Pepsi-Cola bottlers.

PCI

PCI manufactures  concentrates of PEPSI, PEPSI-COLA, DIET PEPSI, PEPSI ONE, PEPSI MAX, 7UP, MIRINDA,  KAS, MOUNTAIN
DEW and other brands for  sale to  franchised  bottlers  outside  of the  United  States  and  Canada.  PCI’s  bottlers  are  licensed,  within  defined
territories,  to  manufacture,  market,  sell  and  distribute,  Pepsi-Cola  beverages  and  syrups.  We have a  minority  interest  in
approximately 40 of these bottlers.  In certain  countries PCI owns and operates the bottling  businesses which  manufacture,  sell and
distribute the Pepsi-Cola  Beverages.  Pepsi-Cola Beverages are sold in approximately 160 countries.  Principal  international  markets
include Mexico, China, Saudi Arabia, India, Argentina, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Spain, The Philippines, and Brazil.

PCI, with its bottlers,  develops the international marketing,  promotion and advertising programs that support the Pepsi-Cola
Beverage brands and brand image;  oversees the quality of the Pepsi-Cola  Beverages;  provides  technical support to its bottlers;  and
develops  new  products  and  packages  and  approves  packaging  suppliers;  and leads and  coordinates  selling  efforts  for certain
international fountain, supermarket and mass merchandising accounts.

TROPICANA PRODUCTS, INC.

Tropicana  Products,  Inc. (TPI) produces,  markets,  sells and  distributes its products under such well-known  trademarks as
TROPICANA PURE PREMIUM and TROPICANA  SEASON’S  BEST. In the United  States,  TPI’s  portfolio  also includes  TROPICANA  TWISTER juice
beverage  products and TROPICANA PURE TROPICS 100% juice  products.  It also  manufactures  and sells FRUI'VITA  chilled juices,  LOOZA
nectars and juices,  COPELLA  fruit  juices and ALVALLE  soups and fruit  juices in Europe.  Principal  international  markets  include
Belgium, Canada, France and the United Kingdom.

TPI’s  manufacturing  operations in Bradenton,  Florida produce  approximately  80% of the worldwide  supply of TROPICANA PURE

PREMIUM  products.  TPI operates 12 regional  distribution  centers that serve customers in the United States and Canada.  Refrigerated
rail cars and  trucks are used to  transport  the  product  quickly  and  efficiently  from the  Bradenton  manufacturing  plant to the
principal  distribution  centers.  A high priority is placed on inventory  management  techniques that ensure product quality and fresh
taste.  Tropicana’s  products are also produced and packaged in  approximately  28 other plants  worldwide  (including  15  independent
facilities) and are available in 63 countries.


TPI also develops the national  marketing,  promotion  and  advertising  programs that support the Tropicana  brands and brand
image;  oversees  the  quality of the  Tropicana  juices and juice  beverages;  develops  new  products  and  packaging;  and leads and
coordinates selling and distribution efforts for national supermarket, foodservice and mass merchandising accounts.

Competition

All of our  businesses  are highly  competitive.  Our snack  foods,  soft drinks and juices  compete in the United  States and
internationally  with widely  distributed  products of a number of major  companies that have plants in many of the areas we serve.  We
also compete with private label snack foods,  soft drinks and juices,  and with the products of local and regional  manufacturers.  The
main areas of competition are price, quality and variety of products, customer service and availability of distribution.

Employees

As of December 30, 2000, we employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,  approximately  124,000 persons  worldwide,  including
approximately 53,000 employed within the United States.  We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.

Raw Materials and Other Supplies

The principal  materials we use in our snack food,  soft drink and juice  businesses are corn  sweeteners,  sugar,  aspartame,
flavorings,  oranges,  grapefruit,  juice concentrates,  vegetable and essential oils, potatoes,  corn, flour, seasonings and packaging
materials.  Since we rely on trucks  to move and  distribute  many of our  products,  fuel is also an  important  commodity.  We employ
specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant  continuous  shortages.  Prices
we pay for such items are subject to  fluctuation.  When prices  increase,  we may or may not pass on such  increases to our customers.
When we have decided to pass along price  increases in the past we have done so  successfully.  However,  there is no assurance that we
will be able to do so in the future.

Governmental Regulation

The conduct of our  businesses,  and the  production,  distribution  and use of many of our  products,  are subject to various
federal laws,  such as the Food,  Drug and Cosmetic Act and the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act.  Our businesses are also subject to state, local and foreign laws.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide  businesses,  including  FRITO-LAY,  LAY'S,  DORITOS,
RUFFLES,  TOSTITOS,  CHEETOS,  FRITOS,  CRACKER JACK, ROLD GOLD, WOW!,  SUNCHIPS,  SANTITAS,  SMARTFOOD,  SABRITAS,  WALKERS,  SMITH’S,
PEPSI-COLA,  PEPSI,  DIET PEPSI,  PEPSI ONE,  PEPSI MAX,  MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG,  AQUAFINA,  7UP and DIET 7UP (outside the United
States),  MIRINDA,  SIERRA MIST,  FRUITWORKS,  TROPICANA PURE PREMIUM,  TROPICANA  SEASON’S  BEST,  TROPICANA  TWISTER,  TROPICANA PURE
TROPICS,  COPELLA,  FRUI'VITA,  and LOOZA.  Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification  purposes, and
we emphasize correct use of our trademarks.  We have authorized  (through licensing  arrangements) the use of many of our trademarks in
such contexts as snack food joint  ventures and Pepsi-Cola  bottling  appointments.  In addition,  we license the use of our trademarks
on collateral products for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.


We either own or have  licenses to use a number of patents  which relate to some of our products and the  processes  for their
production and to the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses.  Some of these patents are licensed to others.

Environmental Matters

We continue to make expenditures to comply with federal,  state, local and foreign  environmental laws and regulations.  These
expenditures have not been material with respect to our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Item 2.    Properties

Frito-Lay, Inc.

FLNA operates 47 food  manufacturing  and processing  plants in the United States and Canada,  of which 43 are owned and 4 are
leased.  In addition,  FLNA owns or leases  approximately  230 warehouses and distribution  centers for storage of food products in the
United States and Canada,  as well as approximately  1,760 smaller  warehouses and storage spaces located  throughout the United States
and Canada.  FLNA owns its headquarters  building and a research facility in Plano,  Texas.  FLNA also leases offices in Dallas,  Texas
and leases or owns  sales/regional  offices throughout the United States. FLI operates  approximately 80 plants and approximately 1,200
distribution centers, warehouses and offices outside of the United States and Canada.


Pepsi-Cola Company

PCNA operates 3 concentrate  plants and 7 warehouses  throughout the United States and Canada.  Licensed  bottlers in which we
have an ownership  interest  operate  approximately 80 bottling  plants.  PCI operates 43 concentrate and bottling plants,  of which 40
are owned and 3 are leased.  PCI also operates approximately 120 warehouses and offices outside of the United States and Canada.

Tropicana

TPI owns 7 production and packing plants,  6 distribution  centers and 9 offices around the world,  including its headquarters
building in Bradenton,  Florida.  TPI also leases  approximately  60 production and packing  plants,  distribution  centers and offices
worldwide.

General

The Company owns its corporate headquarters buildings in Purchase, New York.

With a few exceptions,  leases of plants in the United States and Canada are on a long-term basis,  expiring at various times,
with options to renew for additional  periods.  Most international  plants are leased for varying and usually shorter periods,  with or
without renewal options.

We believe that our  properties  are in good  operating  condition  and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being
used.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are subject to various claims and  contingencies  related to lawsuits,  taxes,  environmental and other matters arising out
of the normal course of business.  Management  believes that the ultimate  liability,  if any, in excess of amounts already  recognized
for such claims or contingencies is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,  financial  condition or
liquidity.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Stockholders

Not applicable.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations, Consolidated Cash
Flows and Liquidity and Capital Resources

Management's
Discussion and  Analysis

(tabular  dollars in millions except per share
amounts)

All per share amounts are
computed using weighted average shares outstanding and assume dilution.

Management’s
     Discussion  and Analysis is presented in four  sections.  The first section
discusses  certain  items  affecting  the  comparability  of results and certain
market and other  risks we face.  The second  section  analyzes  the  Results of
Operations,  first on a  consolidated  basis  and then for each of our  business
segments (pages 15-24).  The final two sections address  Consolidated  Cash Flows
and Liquidity and Capital Resources (page 24).

Cautionary Statements

From time to time, in
written reports (including the Chairman’s  letter in our annual report) and
in oral statements,  we discuss  expectations  regarding our future performance,
the  impact  of  the  euro   conversion   and  the  impact  of  current   global
macro-economic issues. These “forward-looking statements” are based on
currently available  competitive,  financial and economic data and our operating
plans. They are inherently  uncertain,  and investors must recognize that events
could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations.

INTRODUCTION
TO OUR BUSINESS

Items
Affecting Comparability

Fifty-third Week in 2000

Comparisons of 2000 to 1999
are affected by an additional week of results in the 2000 reporting year.
Because our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December, a fifty-third
week is added every 5 or 6 years. The fifty-third week increased 2000 net sales
by an estimated $294 million, operating profit by an estimated $62 million and
net income by an estimated $44 million or $0.03 per share.

Bottling Transactions

In 1998, we announced our
intention to restructure our bottling operations in order to compete more
effectively, particularly in the North American market.

During 1999, we completed
four transactions creating four anchor bottlers. In April 1999, certain
wholly-owned bottling businesses, referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),
completed an initial public offering, with PepsiCo retaining a direct
noncontrolling ownership interest of 35.5%. In May, we combined certain other
bottling operations with Whitman Corporation retaining a noncontrolling
ownership interest of approximately 38%. In July, we combined certain other
bottling operations with PepCom Industries, Inc. retaining a noncontrolling
interest of 35%. In October, we formed a business venture with Pohlad Companies,
a Pepsi-Cola franchisee, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of
approximately 24% in the venture’s principal operating subsidiary,
PepsiAmericas, Inc.


Our financial statements
include the results of our bottling operations on a consolidated basis through
the transaction dates above, and our proportionate share of income under the
equity method subsequent to those dates.

In December 2000, Whitman
merged with PepsiAmericas. We now own approximately 37% of the combined bottler
which has since changed its name to PepsiAmericas, Inc. As part of the merger,
we will participate in an earn-out option whereby we may receive additional
PepsiAmericas’ shares if certain performance targets are met. Our three
anchor bottlers distribute approximately three-fourths of our North American
volume.

The 1999 asset impairment
and restructuring charge of $65 million related to the closure of three plants
and impairment of equipment at Frito-Lay North America. The asset impairment
charges primarily reflected the reduction in the carrying value of the land and
buildings to their estimated fair market value based on current selling prices
for comparable real estate, less costs to sell, and the write-off of the net
book value of equipment which could not be redeployed. The plant closures were
completed during 1999. The majority of these assets were either disposed of or
abandoned in 1999. The restructuring charges of $28 million primarily included
severance costs for approximately 860 employees and plant closing costs.
Substantially all of the terminations occurred during 1999.

The 1998 asset impairment
and restructuring charges of $288 million were comprised of the following:

A
charge of $218 million, for asset impairment of $200 million and restructuring
charges of $18 million related to our Russian bottling operations. The
restructuring actions, in response to lower demand, an adverse change in the
business climate and an expected continuation of operating losses and cash
deficits in Russia following the August 1998 devaluation of the ruble, included
a reduction of our cost structure primarily through closing facilities,
renegotiating manufacturing contracts and reducing the number of employees. We
also evaluated our long-lived bottling assets for impairment, triggered by the
reduction in the utilization of assets caused by the adverse economic
conditions. The impairment charge reduced the net book value of the assets to
their estimated fair market value, based primarily on amounts recently paid for
similar assets in that marketplace. Of the total charge of $218 million, $212
million related to bottling operations that became part of PBG in 1999.

An impairment charge of $54 million
related to manufacturing equipment at
Frito-Lay North America. The charge primarily reflected the write-off of the net
book value of the equipment and related projects. Disposal or abandonment of
these assets was completed in 1999.

A charge of $16 million for employee related costs resulting from the separation
of Pepsi-Cola North America’s concentrate and bottling organizations. Of
this amount, $10 million related to bottling operations that became part of PBG
in 1999.

The employee related costs
for 1998 of $24 million primarily included severance and relocation costs for
approximately 2,700 mostly part-time employees. The terminations either occurred
or related to the bottling operations that became part of PBG in 1999.

Restructuring reserves
totaling $24 million at December 30, 2000 are included in accounts payable and
other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Tropicana Acquisition

In August  1998,  we  acquired  Tropicana  Products,  Inc.  for $3.3  billion.  The 1998  results of  operations  include  Tropicana
subsequent to the acquisition date.

Subsequent Acquisition of South Beach
 Beverage Company, LLC

On January 5, 2001, we
completed the acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC for approximately
$337 million in cash, retaining a 91% interest in the newly formed South Beach
Beverage Company, Inc. (SoBe). SoBe manufactures and markets an innovative line
of alternative non-carbonated beverages including fruit blends, energy drinks,
dairy-based drinks, exotic teas and other beverages with herbal ingredients,
which are distributed under license by a network of independent distributors,
primarily in the United States.


Proposed Merger with The Quaker
 Oats Company

On December 4, 2000, we
announced a merger agreement with The Quaker Oats Company (Quaker). Under the
terms of this agreement, Quaker shareholders will receive 2.3 shares of PepsiCo
capital stock subject to a maximum value of $105 for each Quaker share. In the
event that the value exceeds $105, the exchange ratio is subject to adjustment.
Further, if the value of PepsiCo shares received by Quaker shareholders for each
Quaker share is below $92, Quaker may terminate the merger agreement. Based on
the closing price of our stock of $42.375 per share on December 1, 2000, the
proposed tax-free transaction would be valued at $97.4625 per Quaker share. The
proposed merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including shareholder
approval at both companies, and certain regulatory approvals.

Assuming that 2.3 shares of
PepsiCo capital stock are issued for each share of Quaker common stock, we will
issue approximately 315 million shares of PepsiCo capital stock to Quaker
shareholders in the merger. These PepsiCo capital shares exchanged for Quaker
shares will represent approximately 18% of the outstanding shares of PepsiCo
capital stock after the merger. This information is based on the number of
shares of PepsiCo capital stock and Quaker common stock expected to be
outstanding at the time of the merger. In conjunction with the merger agreement,
we entered into a stock option agreement with Quaker which granted us an option,
under certain circumstances, to purchase up to approximately 19.9% of the
outstanding shares of Quaker common stock.

The merger is expected to
close in the first half of 2001 and is expected to be accounted for as a
“pooling-of-interests.” We anticipate that we will sell between 15 to
20 million shares of repurchased PepsiCo capital stock prior to the closing to
qualify for “pooling-of-interests” accounting treatment.

We expect to incur
transaction costs of approximately $100 million necessary to complete the
merger. We also expect to incur additional costs subsequent to the merger to
integrate the two companies.

New Accounting Standards

In June 1998, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.

SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138, is effective for
our fiscal year beginning December 31, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires
that we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
Based on derivatives outstanding at December 30, 2000, the adoption would
increase assets by approximately $14 million and liabilities by approximately $9
million with approximately $5 million recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income and less than $1 million recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

In May 2000, the Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue 00-14,

Accounting for
Certain Sales Incentives

. EITF 00-14 addresses the recognition and income
statement classification of various sales incentives. Among its requirements,
the consensus will require the costs related to consumer coupons currently
classified as marketing costs to be classified as a reduction of revenue. The
impact of adopting this consensus is not expected to have a material impact on our results of
 operations. The consensus is effective for the second quarter of 2001.

In January 2001, the EITF
reached a consensus on Issue 00-22,

Accounting for “Points” and
Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for
Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future.

Issue 00-22 will
require that certain cash rebates to customers currently recognized as marketing
costs be classified as a reduction of revenue. The consensus is effective for the


first quarter of 2001. We are currently assessing this consensus and have
not yet made a determination of the impact adoption will have on our
consolidated financial statements.

During 2000, the EITF added
to its agenda various other revenue recognition issues that could impact the
income statement classification of certain promotional payments. We classify
promotional payments as either a reduction of net sales or marketing costs.
Total promotional expenses classified as marketing costs were $2.4 billion in
2000, $2.3 billion in 1999 and $2.1 billion in 1998.

Market and
Other Risk Factors

Market Risk

The principal market risks
(i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices)
to which we are exposed are:

•   commodity prices, affecting the cost
of our raw materials and fuel,

•   foreign exchange risks, and

•   interest rates on our debt and short-term investment portfolios.

In the normal course of
business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including the
use of hedging transactions, executed in accordance with our policies. Our
hedging transactions include, but are not limited to, the use of various
derivative financial and commodity instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not
use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure. We do not use
derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Commodity Prices

We are subject to market
risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover
increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate. We manage this risk primarily through the use
of fixed-price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and
futures contracts. We use futures contracts to hedge fluctuations in prices of a
portion of anticipated commodity purchases, primarily oil, corn, fuel and juice
concentrates. Our use of futures contracts is not significant to our commodity
purchases.

Our commodity futures
positions were $45 million at December 30, 2000 and $145 million at December 25,
1999. Our commodity futures position resulted in a net unrealized gain of $3
million at December 30, 2000 and a net unrealized loss of $6 million at December
25, 1999. We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have reduced
the 2000 unrealized net gain by $5 million and increased the 1999 unrealized net
loss by $14 million. Any change in the value of our derivative instruments would
be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying
hedged items.

Foreign Exchange

International operations
constitute about 21% of our 2000 and 20% of our 1999 business segment operating
profit. Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in
foreign exchange rates, primarily the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian
dollar and euro.  Changes in foreign exchange rates would have the largest impact
on translating our international operating profit into U.S. dollars.

On occasion, we may enter
into derivative financial instruments, as necessary, to reduce the effect of
foreign exchange rate changes. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives
centrally. At


December 30, 2000, we had forward contracts to  exchange British
pounds for U.S. dollars with an aggregate notional amount of $336 million.
Unrealized losses on these contracts were $9 million at December 30, 2000. We
estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rate would have
increased the 2000 unrealized losses by $32 million. Forward contracts
outstanding at December 25, 1999 were not material to the financial statements.
Any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially
offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.

Interest Rates

We centrally manage our
debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,
tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use interest rate and
currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific
debt issuances, with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs.
These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that
they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity
dates of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity dates of
the related debt. Accordingly, any market risk or opportunity associated with
these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt.

Our investment portfolios
primarily consist of cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities.
Accordingly, the carrying amounts approximate market value. It is our practice
to hold these investments to maturity.

Assuming year-end 2000 and
1999 variable rate debt and investment levels, a one-point increase in interest
rates would have increased net interest expense by $8 million in 2000 and $13
million in 1999. The change in this impact from 1999 resulted from decreased
variable rate debt levels and increased investment levels at year-end 2000. This
sensitivity analysis includes the impact of existing interest rate and currency
swaps.

Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, member
countries of the European Union fixed conversion rates between their existing
currencies (legacy currencies) and one common currency - the euro. The euro
trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions.
Conversion to the euro eliminated currency exchange rate risk between the member
countries. Beginning in January 2002, new euro-denominated bills and coins will
be issued, and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation. Our
operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established plans to
address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion. These issues include,
among others, the need to adapt computer and financial systems, business
processes and equipment, such as vending machines, to accommodate
euro-denominated transactions and the impact of one common currency on pricing.
Since financial systems and processes currently accommodate multiple currencies,
the plans contemplate conversion in 2001 if not already addressed in conjunction
with other system or process initiatives. We do not expect the system and
equipment conversion costs to be material. Due to numerous uncertainties, we
cannot reasonably estimate the long-term effects one common currency may have on
pricing and the resulting impact, if any, on financial condition or results of
operations.


RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

Consolidated Review

General

In the discussions below,
the year-over-year dollar change in pound or kilo sales of salty and sweet
snacks for Frito-Lay, bottler case sales by company-owned bottling operations
and concentrate unit sales to franchisees for Pepsi-Cola, and four-gallon
equivalent cases for Tropicana is referred to as

volume

. Price changes
over the prior year and the impact of product, package and country sales mix
changes are referred to as

effective net pricing

.

Comparable net sales and
operating profit, also referred to as new PepsiCo, present the deconsolidation
of our bottling operations as if it had occurred at the beginning of 1998, and
exclude impairment and restructuring charges and the impact of the fifty-third
week in 2000. Tropicana results are included subsequent to its acquisition in
1998.

Comparable

$20,144     $18,666     $16,300          8        15

In 2000, comparable net
sales increased 8%. This increase is primarily due to volume gains across all
business segments and effective net pricing at Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola. Volume
gains contributed 6 percentage points of growth and higher effective net pricing
contributed 3 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by a net
unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, which reduced
comparable net sales by 1 percentage point. The fifty-third week enhanced
reported net sales by almost 2 percentage points.

In 1999, comparable net
sales increased 15%. This increase primarily reflects the inclusion of Tropicana
for the full year in 1999, volume gains at Frito-Lay and higher effective net
pricing at Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola North America. The inclusion of Tropicana
contributed 10 percentage points of growth. Volume gains contributed 4
percentage points of growth and higher effective net pricing contributed 3
percentage points. These advances were partially offset by an unfavorable
foreign currency impact, primarily in Brazil and Mexico, which reduced
comparable net sales growth by nearly 2 percentage points. Reported net sales
decreased 9% reflecting the bottling deconsolidation, partially offset by the
inclusion of Tropicana for the full year in 1999.

  Operating profit margin        15.7%      15.2%      15.5%      0.5      (0.3)

In 2000, comparable
operating profit margin increased 0.5 percentage points primarily reflecting the
favorable margin impact of the higher effective net pricing and increased
volume. These improvements were partially offset by the margin impact of
increases in selling and distribution expenses primarily at Frito-Lay
International, advertising and marketing expenses primarily at Pepsi-Cola North
America and general and administrative expenses.

In 1999, comparable
operating profit margin declined 0.3 percentage points reflecting the margin
impact of Tropicana for a full year in 1999, increased general and
administrative expenses and increased advertising and marketing expenses across
all business segments. These decreases were partially offset by the margin
impact of the higher effective net pricing.

Bottling
Equity Income

Bottling equity income
includes our share of the net earnings or losses from our bottling equity
investments. From time to time, we may increase or dispose of particular
bottling investments. Any gains or losses from disposals, as well as other
transactions related to our bottling investments, are reflected in equity
income.

In 2000, net bottling
equity income was $130 million. The $18 million favorable impact of an
accounting change by PBG was offset by our share of restructuring actions in
certain other bottling affiliates and the net loss from changes in our equity
ownership interests. The fifty-third week in 2000 enhanced reported net bottler
equity income by $5 million.

In 1999, bottling equity
income of $83 million reflects the equity income of our previously consolidated
bottling operations from the applicable transaction closing dates and the equity
income or loss of other unconsolidated bottling affiliates for the second, third
and fourth quarters.

Gain on
Bottling Transactions

The 1999 gain on bottling
transactions of $1.0 billion ($270 million after-tax or $0.18 per share) relates
to the second quarter PBG and Whitman bottling transactions. The PBG transaction
resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion ($476 million after-tax or $0.32 per
share) in the second quarter. The majority of the taxes are expected to be
deferred indefinitely. The Whitman transaction resulted in an after-tax loss to
us of $206 million or $0.14 per share. The 1999 PepCom transaction was accounted
for as a nonmonetary exchange for book purposes. However, a portion of the
transaction was taxable which resulted in income tax expense of $25 million or
$0.02 per share. The 1999 Pohlad transaction was structured as a fair value
exchange with no resulting gain or loss.

                              ======      ======      ======

In 2000, interest expense
declined 39% reflecting significantly lower average debt levels, partially
offset by higher average interest rates. Lower average debt levels reflect the
third quarter 1999 repayment of borrowings used to finance the Tropicana
acquisition and the absence of the financing related to the Pepsi Bottling
Group. Interest income declined 36% primarily due to lower average investment
balances partially offset by favorable changes in the fair value of equity
derivative contracts. The fifty-third week increased net interest expense by $3
million.

In 1999, interest expense
decreased 8% due to lower average interest rates on slightly lower average
outstanding debt levels. Interest income increased 59% primarily due to higher
average investment balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates on
these balances. The higher average investment balances primarily result from the
first quarter proceeds received from PBG as settlement of pre-existing
intercompany balances.

 1998.

In 2000, the comparable
effective tax rate remained nearly flat. The reported effective tax rate
decreased 11.9 percentage points primarily as a result of the tax effects of the
1999 bottling transactions.

In 1999, the comparable
effective tax rate increased 1.2 percentage points primarily from the absence in
1999 of the settlement in 1998 of prior years’ audit issues offset by the
benefit of proportionately lower bottling income. The reported effective tax
rate increased 32 percentage points primarily as a result of the tax effects of
the bottling transactions and the absence in 1999 of the 1998 income tax benefit
relating to our concentrate operations in Puerto Rico.

In 2000, comparable net
income increased 16% and the related net income per share increased 18%
reflecting higher operating profit and lower net interest expense. The increase
in net income per share also reflects the benefit from a 1.4% reduction in
average shares outstanding assuming dilution.

In 1999, comparable net
income increased 5% and the related net income per share increased 6% due to
increased operating profit and a decrease in net interest expense, partially

a 1.5% reduction in average shares outstanding assuming dilution.

2000 vs. 1999

Comparable net sales
increased 7% primarily due to volume gains and higher effective net pricing.
Sales of our new Snack Kit and Snack Mix products and Oberto’s natural beef
jerky snacks accounted for almost one-third of this growth. The fifty-third week
enhanced reported net sales by 2 percentage points.

Pound volume advanced 4%
excluding the impact of the fifty-third week. This growth was primarily driven
by most of our core brands, excluding the low-fat and no-fat versions, and by
our new Snack Kit products. The growth in core brands was led by solid
single-digit growth in Lay’s brand potato chips, Cheetos brand cheese puffs
and Ruffles brand potato chips, as well as double-digit growth in Tostitos brand
tortilla chips. These gains were partially offset by continued declines in WOW!
brand products. Pound volume growth including the fifty-third week was 6%.

Comparable operating profit
increased 10% primarily reflecting the higher volume, higher effective net
pricing and reduced vegetable oil costs partially offset by higher energy and
fuel costs. Advertising and marketing expenses grew at a slightly slower rate
than sales. The margin impact of these favorable factors contributed to the
comparable operating profit margin improvement of 0.7 percentage points. The
fifty-third week enhanced reported operating profit growth by 2 percentage
points.

1999 vs. 1998

Net sales grew 5% due to
volume gains and higher effective net pricing.

Pound volume advanced 4%.
The advance was led by high single-digit growth in our core corn products,
excluding the low-fat and no-fat versions, mid single-digit growth in Lay’s
brand potato chips and significant growth in Cracker Jack brand products and
branded dips. Volume declines in our WOW!, “Baked” Lay’s and
“Baked” Tostitos brand products partially offset these gains.

Comparable operating profit
increased 11% reflecting the higher volume, higher effective net pricing and
reduced commodity costs, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing
expenses. Advertising and marketing expenses grew at a faster rate than sales
due primarily to increased promotional allowances.

effective net pricing at Gamesa and Sabritas in Mexico. The net impact from
acquisitions/divestitures contributed 2 percentage points to sales growth.
Weaker foreign currencies, primarily in the United Kingdom and Australia,
decreased net sales by 2 percentage points.

Salty snack kilos increased
13% excluding the impact of the fifty-third week. This growth was led by
double-digit increases at Sabritas, our European and Latin American joint
ventures and Walkers. Acquisitions did not significantly impact the growth in
salty snack volume. Salty snack kilo growth increased 15% including the
fifty-third week. Sweet snack kilos increased 4%, excluding the impact of the

higher effective net pricing. Overall, the higher effective net pricing more
than offset the net impact of weaker currencies outside of Brazil. The
unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Mexico, reduced net sales
growth by 4 percentage points. Net contributions from acquisitions/divestitures
contributed 1 percentage point to the sales growth.

Salty snack kilos increased
6%. The advance was led by double-digit growth at Sabritas in Mexico and several
of our businesses in Central and South America and in Asia. Including
acquisitions/divestitures, total salty snack kilos increased an additional 4
percentage points to 10% driven primarily by the acquisition in Australia and by
acquisitions and mergers of salty snack food businesses in South America. Sweet
snack kilos increased 6% led by strong growth at Gamesa and Sabritas in Mexico.


Sweet snack kilos, including the net effect of acquisitions/divestitures,
declined 5% primarily as a result of the disposal of our chocolate and biscuit
businesses in Poland.

Operating profit increased
11%. Excluding Brazil, operating profit increased 25% driven by strong
performances at Sabritas, Gamesa and several of our businesses in Asia. The net
impact of weaker foreign currencies outside of Brazil, primarily in Mexico and
the United Kingdom, reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points. The
unfavorable foreign currency impact was more than offset by higher effective net
pricing.

the impact of the fifty-third week in 2000 and impairment and restructuring
charges of $6 in 1998.

2000 vs. 1999

Comparable net sales
increased 8%. Higher concentrate and fountain pricing and higher Aquafina
royalties contributed 8 percentage points of growth, and increased volume,
including the launch of Sierra Mist and our new Dole juice product, contributed
2 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by increased customer
support. The fifty-third week enhanced reported net sales by 1 percentage point.

BCS volume increased 1%
driven by double-digit growth of Aquafina and distribution gains from
Fruitworks. In addition, the introduction of Sierra Mist and low single-digit
growth by Diet Pepsi contributed to the increase. These gains were partially
offset by a low single-digit decline in Pepsi and double-digit declines in Pepsi
One and Lemon Lime Slice. Concentrate shipments were in line with BCS. On a
fifty-three week basis, concentrate shipments increased 1.3%.

Comparable operating profit
increased 9% primarily due to the higher concentrate pricing, increased volume
and the higher Aquafina royalties. These increases were partially offset by
higher advertising and marketing expenses, increased customer support and
increased general and administrative expenses.


1999 vs. 1998

Comparable net sales
increased 3% reflecting higher concentrate pricing net of increased customer
support, and increased royalty income associated with Aquafina bottled water.
Reported net sales increased $1.2 billion, primarily due to the bottling
deconsolidation.

BCS increased nearly 2% led
by Pepsi One, introduced late in 1998, mid single-digit growth of our Mountain
Dew brand and strong double-digit growth of our Aquafina brand of bottled water.
These gains were partially offset by single-digit declines in Pepsi and Diet
Pepsi brands. Concentrate shipments were even with prior year.

Comparable operating profit
increased 2% primarily reflecting the increase in the net benefit of the higher
pricing and the increased royalty income. These increases were partially offset
by higher fountain related costs, increased advertising and marketing spending
and higher general and administrative costs.

1998 and operating  profit also excludes impairment and restructuring charges of $6 in 1998.

PCI reports results on a
calendar year basis, therefore, there is no impact in 2000 from the fifty-third week.

2000 vs. 1999

Comparable  net sales
increased 3% due to volume gains and higher  effective net pricing,  partially  offset by a
broad-based  net
unfavorable  foreign  currency impact led by Europe.  The net unfavorable  foreign currency
impact reduced net sales by 4 percentage
points.

BCS increased  5%. This
reflects  broad-based  increases  led by a doubling of volume in Russia where  volumes
recovered  from the effects of the 1998 ruble  devaluation.  BCS growth was also  driven by  double-digit  growth
in China,  India and  Thailand  and by continued growth in Mexico. Through December,  total concentrate shipments to franchisees,
including those previously  wholly-owned bottlers in which we own an equity interest, grew 2% while their BCS grew at a higher rate.

Comparable operating profit
 increased 37% primarily  reflecting the higher effective net pricing and volume gains,
partially offset
by higher general and administrative expenses to support top-line growth, and net unfavorable
foreign currency impact.


1999 vs. 1998

Comparable net sales
increased 6%. This advance  reflects net  contributions  from  acquisitions/divestitures,
higher volume and higher effective net pricing,  partially offset by a net unfavorable  foreign currency impact.
The net unfavorable  foreign currency impact,  primarily in Brazil, Mexico, India and Germany,  reduced net sales by 3 percentage
points. Reported net sales increased 11% which excludes the impact of the bottling deconsolidation.

BCS increased 1% primarily
reflecting  double-digit growth in China, strong double-digit growth in Germany,  Japan and
Pakistan, and single-digit  growth  in India and Saudi  Arabia.  These  advances  were  partially  offset
by lower  BCS in  Brazil,  Russia,  the Philippines  and Thailand.  Through  December  total  concentrate  shipments to  franchisees,
 including  those former  wholly-owned bottlers in which we now own an equity interest, increased 2% while their BCS increased at a
slower rate.

Comparable  operating  profit
  increased 3% reflecting  volume gains and higher  effective net pricing.  These gains were reduced by
higher advertising and marketing expenses, net losses from acquisitions/divestitures and
unfavorable foreign currency impact.

2000 vs. 1999

Comparable net sales grew
6% primarily due to volume gains. These gains were partially offset by lower
effective net pricing driven by higher trade spending and an unfavorable foreign
currency impact in Europe. The unfavorable foreign currency impact reduced net
sales by 1 percentage point.

Equivalent case volume grew
8%, led by continued double-digit worldwide growth in Pure Premium including
strong double-digit growth in Pure Premium nutritionals and blends. On a
fifty-three week basis, equivalent case volume increased 10%.

Comparable operating profit
increased 30% primarily due to the volume gains, production leverage and lower
orange juice costs. These increases were partially offset by the higher trade
spending, increased


media spending and consumer promotions and the unfavorable
foreign currency impact. The unfavorable foreign currency impact reduced
operating profit by 4 percentage points.

1999 vs. 1998

Volume for the fiscal year
1999 increased 4%, led by an 8% increase in Tropicana Pure Premium worldwide.
Higher pricing taken to offset increases in the cost of oranges, combined with
volume growth, drove 1999 operating performance.

CONSOLIDATED
CASH FLOWS

In 2000, cash and cash
equivalents decreased $100 million to $864 million. Cash flows from operating
activities were used to fund share repurchases, capital spending, dividend
payments and long-term debt payments.

In 1999, cash and cash
equivalents increased $653 million to $964 million. Cash flows from operating
activities and proceeds from debt issuances were used primarily for repayments
of short-term borrowings, share repurchases, capital spending and dividend
payments.

Share Repurchases

Our share repurchase activity was as
follows:

2000      1999       1998
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cost                                                $1,430    $1,285     $2,230

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Board of Directors
rescinded all  authorizations  for share repurchases on December 3, 2000 as a result of the merger agreement
with Quaker.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our strong cash-generating
capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world.

We maintain $1.5 billion of
 revolving  credit  facilities.  Of the $1.5 billion as of year-end  2000,  $600 million  expires in June
2001.  The remaining  $900 million  expires in June 2005. At expiration,  these  facilities
can be extended an additional  year uponthe  mutual  consent of  PepsiCo  and the  lending
institutions.  The credit  facilities  exist  largely  to support  issuances  of  short-term
debt and remain unused at year-end 2000. At year-end 2000, $750 million of short-term  borrowings
  were  reclassified as long-term, reflecting our intent and ability, through the existence of the
unused credit facilities, to refinance  these  borrowings.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts; all per share amounts assume dilution)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Items Affecting Comparability

Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December and, as a
result, a fifty-third week is added every five or six years. The fiscal year
ended December 30, 2000 consisted of fifty-three weeks. The fifty-third week
increased 2000 net sales by an estimated $294 million, operating profit by an
estimated $62 million and net income by an estimated $44 million or $0.03 per
share. See Note 17 - Business Segments for the impact on PepsiCo’s business
segments.

The consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of
the bottling transactions described in Note 2 are not comparable with the
consolidated financial statements presented for prior periods as certain
bottling operations that were previously consolidated are now accounted for
under the equity method. In addition, the third quarter 1998 acquisition of
Tropicana described in Note 3 and the asset impairment and restructuring charges
described in Note 4 affect comparability. Certain reclassifications were made to
the 1999 and 1998 amounts to conform to the 2000 presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of
PepsiCo, Inc. and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates,
over which we exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for
by the equity method. Accordingly, our share of the net income or loss of such
unconsolidated affiliates is included in consolidated net income.

Issuances of Subsidiary Stock

The issuance of stock by one of our subsidiaries to third
parties reduces our proportionate ownership interest in the subsidiary. Unless
the issuance of such stock is part of a broader corporate reorganization, we
recognize a gain or loss, equal to the difference between the issuance price per
share and our carrying amount per share. Such gain or loss, net of the related
tax, is recognized in consolidated net income when the transaction occurs.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when products are delivered to customers.
Sales terms generally do not allow a right to return.

Marketing Costs

Marketing costs are reported in selling, general and
administrative expenses and include costs of advertising, promotional programs
and other marketing activities. Advertising expenses were $1.3 billion in 2000,
$1.3 billion in 1999 and $1.0 billion in 1998. Deferred advertising expense,
classified as prepaid expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $92 million in 2000
and $73 million in 1999. Deferred advertising costs are expensed in the year first used and
consist of:

F-9

•   media and personal service prepayments,

•   promotional materials in inventory, and

•   production costs of future media advertising.

We classify promotional payments as either a reduction of net
sales or as marketing costs. New PepsiCo total promotional expenses classified
as marketing costs were $2.4 billion in 2000, $2.3 billion in 1999 and $2.1
billion in 1998.

During 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
(FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) added to its agenda various revenue
recognition issues that could impact the income statement classification of
certain promotional payments. In May 2000, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
00-14,

Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives

. EITF 00-14 addresses the
recognition and income statement classification of various sales incentives.
Among its requirements, the consensus will require the costs related to consumer
coupons currently classified as marketing costs to be classified as a reduction
of revenue. The impact of adopting this consensus is not expected to have a
material impact on our results of operations. The consensus is effective for the
second quarter of 2001.

In January 2001, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
00-22,

Accounting for “Points” and Certain Other Time-Based or
Volume-Based Sales les Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or
Services to Be Delivered in the Future.

Issue 00-22 will require that
certain cash rebates to customers currently recognized as marketing costs be
classified as a reduction of revenue. The consensus is effective for the first
quarter of 2001. We are currently assessing this consensus and have not yet made
a determination of the impact adoption will have on our consolidated financial
statements.

Distribution Costs

Distribution costs are reported in selling, general and
administrative expenses and include the costs of shipping and handling
activities. Shipping and handling expenses were $2.5 billion in 2000, $2.4
billion in 1999 and $2.9 billion in 1998.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure stock-based compensation cost as the excess of the
quoted market price of PepsiCo Capital Stock at the grant date over the amount
the employee must pay for the stock (exercise price). Our policy is to generally
grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the stock price at the date
of grant and accordingly, no compensation cost is recognized. Under our
incentive programs, compensation cost for performance share units granted and
for cash payments expected to be paid to employees in lieu of stock options is
based on the grant date value and recognized over the vesting period of the
award.

Derivative Instruments

The interest differential to be paid or received on an
interest rate swap is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as the
differential occurs. If an interest rate swap position were to be terminated,
the gain or loss realized upon termination would be deferred and amortized to
interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt instrument it
was intended to modify. However, if the underlying debt instrument were to be
settled prior to maturity, the gain or loss realized upon termination would be
recognized immediately.

F-10

The differential to be paid or received on a currency swap
related to non-U.S. dollar denominated debt is charged or credited to selling,
general and administrative expenses as the differential occurs. This is fully
offset by the corresponding gain or loss recognized on the currency translation
of the debt, as both amounts are based upon the same exchange rates. The
currency differential not yet settled in cash is reflected in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet under the appropriate current or noncurrent receivable or payable
caption. If a currency swap position were to be terminated prior to maturity,
the gain or loss realized upon termination would be immediately recognized in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Gains and losses on futures contracts designated as hedges of
future commodity purchases are deferred in the Consolidated Balance Sheet under
the appropriate current asset or liability caption and included in the cost of
the hedged commodity when purchased. Changes in the value of such contracts used
to hedge commodity purchases are highly correlated to the changes in the value
of the purchased commodity. Subsequent changes in the value of such contracts
that cease to be highly correlated or changes in the value of futures contracts
not designated as hedges are recognized in cost of sales immediately. If a
futures contract designated as a hedge were to be terminated, the gain or loss
realized upon termination would be included in the cost of the hedged commodity
when purchased.

Forward exchange contracts used to hedge the foreign currency
exposure of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair
value. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in selling,
general and administrative expenses.

Equity derivative contracts for the purchase of PepsiCo capital
stock are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value as a prepaid
expense. Changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized as interest
income.

The cash flows related to the above derivative instruments are
classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in a manner consistent
with those of the transactions being hedged.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents represent funds temporarily invested with
original maturities of three months or less. All other investment portfolios are
primarily classified as short-term investments.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the
average, first-in, first-out or last-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is calculated on a straight-line basis. Buildings and improvements are
depreciated over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 20 to 40
years. Machinery and equipment (including fleet) are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 2 to 10 years.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill, the excess of our investments in unconsolidated
affiliates over our equity in the underlying assets of these investments, and
trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years. Reacquired franchise rights and
other identifiable

F-11

intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets to be
Held and Used in the Business

All long-lived assets, including goodwill, investments in
unconsolidated affiliates and other identifiable intangibles, are evaluated for
impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market
value based on the best information available. Estimated fair market value is
generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable
management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows.

The depreciation or amortization periods for long-lived assets
to be held and used are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or
circumstances have occurred that warrant revision.

Accounting Changes

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting
for for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

SFAS 133, as amended
by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138, is effective for our fiscal year beginning December
31, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that we recognize all
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Based on derivatives
outstanding at December 30, 2000, the adoption would increase assets by
approximately $14 million and liabilities by approximately $9 million with
approximately $5 million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income
and less than $1 million recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Note 2 - Investments in Unconsolidated
 Affiliates

During 1999, we completed four transactions creating four anchor
bottlers which manufacture, sell and distribute carbonated and non-carbonated
Pepsi-Cola beverages under master bottling agreements with us.

In April 1999, certain wholly-owned bottling businesses,
referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), completed an initial public
offering, with PepsiCo retaining a direct noncontrolling ownership interest of
35.5%. We received $5.5 billion of debt proceeds as settlement of pre-existing
intercompany amounts due to us and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion
($476 million after-tax or $0.32 per share) as a result of the transaction. In
May, we combined certain other bottling operations with Whitman Corporation to
create new Whitman, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of
approximately 38%. The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss to PepsiCo of
$206 million or $0.14 per share. In July, we combined certain other bottling
operations with PepCom Industries, Inc. retaining a noncontrolling interest of
35%. This transaction was accounted for as a nonmonetary exchange for book
purposes. However, a portion of the transaction was taxable and resulted in
income tax expense of $25 million or $0.02 per share. In October, we formed a
business venture with Pohlad Companies, a Pepsi-Cola franchisee, retaining a
noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 24% in the venture’s
principal operating subsidiary, PepsiAmericas, Inc. The transaction was
structured as a fair value exchange with no resulting gain or loss.

In December 2000, Whitman merged with PepsiAmericas. We now own
approximately 37% of the combined company. As part of the merger, we will
participate in an earn-out option whereby we may

F-12

receive additional shares ifcertain performance targets are met. Effective January 2001, the name of the
combined company was changed to PepsiAmericas, Inc.

PBG

In addition to approximately 38% of PBG’s outstanding
common stock that we now own, we own 100% of PBG’s class B common stock and
approximately 7% of the equity of Bottling Group, LLC, PBG’s principal
operating subsidiary. This gives us economic ownership of approximately 42% of
PBG’s combined operations.

Related Party Transactions

Our significant related party transactions involve our
investments in unconsolidated bottling affiliates. We sell concentrate to these
affiliates that is used in the production of carbonated soft drinks and
non-carbonated beverages. We also sell certain finished goods. They purchase
sweeteners and certain other raw materials through us. The raw material
purchases on behalf of these bottling affiliates, related payments to suppliers
and collections from the bottlers are not reflected in our consolidated
financial statements. We also provide certain administrative and other services
to these bottling affiliates under negotiated fee arrangements.

Further, because we share a common business objective with these
bottling affiliates of increasing the availability and consumption of Pepsi-Cola
beverages, we provide various forms of marketing support to

F-14

or on behalf of them
to promote our beverages. This support covers a variety of initiatives,
including marketplace support, marketing programs, capital equipment investment
and shared media expense. Based on the objective of the programs and
initiatives, we record marketing support as an adjustment to net sales or as
selling, general and administrative expense.

These transactions with our unconsolidated bottling affiliates
are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows:

2000          1999       1998
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net sales.........................................       $2,546        $1,779       $576
Selling, general and administrative expenses......       $  653        $  554       $169

As of December 30, 2000, the receivables from these bottling
affiliates are $187 million and payables to these affiliates are $125 million.
As of December 25, 1999, the receivables from these bottling affiliates were $93
million and the payables to these affiliates were $131 million. Such amounts are
settled on terms consistent with other trade receivables and payables. See Note
16 regarding our guarantee of PBG related debt.

Note 3 - Acquisitions

During 2000, we made acquisitions, primarily of various
international salty snack food businesses, which aggregated $98 million.

During 1999, we made acquisitions, primarily investments in
various bottlers including investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which
aggregated $430 million in cash.

During 1998, we completed the acquisitions of Tropicana
Products, Inc. from The Seagram Company Ltd. for $3.3 billion in cash and The
Smith’s Snackfoods Company in Australia from United Biscuits Holdings plc
for $270 million in cash. In addition during 1998, acquisitions and investments
in unconsolidated affiliates included the purchase of the remaining ownership
interest in various bottlers and purchases of various other international salty
snack food businesses. Acquisitions for 1998 aggregated $4.5 billion in cash.

The results of operations of acquisitions are generally included
in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition. The acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method. The
purchase prices have been allocated based on the estimated fair value of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess purchase prices over the
fair values of the net assets acquired of approximately $4 million in 2000, $271
million in 1999 and $3.2 billion in 1998 were allocated to goodwill.

The 1999 asset impairment and restructuring charge of $65
million related to the closure of three plants and impairment of equipment at
Frito-Lay North America. The asset impairment charges primarily reflected the
reduction in the carrying value of the land and buildings to their estimated
fair market value based on current selling prices for comparable real estate,
less costs to sell, and the write-off of the net

F-16

book value of equipment which
cannot be redeployed. The plant closures were completed during 1999. The
majority of these assets were either disposed of or abandoned in 1999. The
restructuring charges of $28 million primarily included severance costs for
approximately 860 employees and plant closing costs. Substantially all of the
terminations occurred during 1999.

The 1998 asset impairment and restructuring charges of $288
million were comprised of the following:

A charge of $218  million, for asset impairment  of $200  million and  restructuring
charges of $18 million  related to our Russian bottling operations.  The restructuring
actions, in response to lower demand, an adverse change in the business climate and an
expected continuation of operating  losses and cash deficits in Russia following the August
1998 devaluation of the ruble, included a reduction of our cost structure primarily through
closing  facilities, renegotiating  manufacturing  contracts and reducing the number of
employees.  We also evaluated our long-lived bottling assets for impairment, triggered by the
reduction in the utilization of assets caused by the adverse economic conditions.  The
impairment charge reduced the net book value of the assets to their estimated fair market
value,  based primarily on amounts recently paid for similar assets in that marketplace.  Of
the total charge of $218 million, $212 million related to bottling operations that became
part of PBG in 1999 (see Note 2).

An impairment
charge of $54 million  related to  manufacturing  equipment at Frito-Lay North America.  The charge primarily reflected the write-off of the net book value of the
equipment and related projects.  Disposal or abandonment of these assets was completed in 1999.

A charge of
$16 million for employee related costs resulting from the separation of
Pepsi-Cola North America's concentrate and bottling organizations (see Note 2). Of this
amount, $10 million related to bottling operations that became part of PBG in 1999.

The employee related costs for 1998 of $24 million primarily
included severance and relocation costs for approximately 2,700 mostly part-time
employees. The terminations either occurred or related to the bottling
operations that became part of PBG in 1999.

Note 5 - Income Per Share

We present two income per share measures, basic and assuming
dilution, on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. “Basic”
income per share equals net income divided by weighted average common shares
outstanding during the period. Income per share “assuming dilution”
equals net income divided by the sum of weighted average common shares
outstanding during the period plus common stock equivalents, such as stock
options.

The following reconciles
shares outstanding at the beginning of the year to average shares outstanding:

Net income per share - assuming dilution excludes incremental

related to employee stock options due to their antidilutive effect at each
respective year end.

Identifiable intangible assets possess economic value but lack
physical substance. These assets primarily arise from the allocation of purchase
prices of businesses acquired. Amounts assigned to such identifiable intangibles
are based on independent appraisals or internal estimates. Goodwill represents
the excess purchase price after allocation to all identifiable net assets.

The above amounts are presented net of accumulated amortization
of $751 million at year-end 2000 and $640 million at year-end 1999.

The weighted average interest rates in the above table include
the effects of associated interest rate and currency swaps at year-end 2000 and
1999. Also, see Note 12 for a discussion of our use of interest rate and
currency swaps, our management of the inherent credit risk and fair value
information related to debt and interest rate and currency swaps.

Interest Rate Swaps

The following table indicates the notional amount and weighted
average interest rates of interest rate swaps outstanding at year-end 2000 and
1999. The weighted average variable interest rates that we pay, which are
primarily linked to either commercial paper or LIBOR rates, are based on rates
as of the respective balance sheet date and are subject to change.

2000             1999
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Receive fixed-pay variable
    Notional amount............................        $1,242           $1,162
    Weighted average receive rate..............           4.8%             6.1%
    Weighted average pay rate..................           5.2%             6.1%

The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the debt
they modify. The swaps terminate at various dates through 2013. At year-end
2000, approximately 72% of total debt, including the effects of the associated
interest rate swaps, was exposed to variable interest rates, compared to 67% in
1999. In addition to variable rate long-term debt, all debt with maturities of
less than one year is categorized as variable for purposes of this measure.

Currency Swaps

We enter into currency swaps to hedge our currency exposure on
certain non-U.S. dollar denominated debt upon issuance of such debt. The terms
of the currency swaps match the terms of the debt they modify. The currency
swaps terminate at various dates in 2001.

At year-end 2000, the aggregate carrying amount of debt
denominated in Swiss francs and Luxembourg francs was $122 million. The payables
under related currency swaps were $43 million, resulting in an

F-20

effective U.S.
dollar liability of $165 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6%,
including the effects of related interest rate swaps.

At year-end 1999, the aggregate carrying amount of debt
denominated in Swiss francs, Luxembourg francs and Australian dollars was $244
million. The payables under related currency swaps were $62 million, resulting
in an effective U.S. dollar liability of $306 million with a weighted average
interest rate of 6.3%, including the effects of related interest rate swaps.

Revolving Credit Facilities

We maintain $1.5 billion of revolving credit facilities. Of the
$1.5 billion, $600 million expire in June 2001. The remaining $900 million
expire in June 2005. The credit facilities exist largely to support issuances
of short-term debt. Annually, these facilities can be extended an additional
year upon the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions. These
facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions.

The current reclassification of short-term borrowings to
long-term debt reflects our intent and ability, through the existence of the
unused credit facilities, to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis.

Long-term debt outstanding at December 30, 2000 matures as
follows during the next five years:

Note 12 - Financial Instruments

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our policy prohibits the use of derivative financial instruments
for speculative purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control
their use. The following discussion excludes futures contracts used to hedge our
commodity purchases.

Our use of derivative financial instruments primarily involves
interest rate and currency swaps, which are intended to reduce borrowing costs
by effectively modifying the interest rate and currency of specific debt
issuances. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the
debt they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and
maturity dates of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity
dates of the related debt. Accordingly, any market risk or opportunity
associated with these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the
related debt. Our credit risk related to interest rate and currency swaps is
considered low because such swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy
counterparties, are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short
duration. Further, there is no significant concentration with counterparties.
See Note 11 for the notional amounts, related interest rates and maturities of
the interest rate and currency swaps.

At year-end 2000, we have forward contracts to exchange British
pounds for U.S. dollars with an aggregate notional amount of $336 million. These
contracts mature between 2001 and 2003 and are used to hedge U.S.
dollar-denominated intercompany loans. Our credit risk is considered low because
such forward exchange contracts are with strong creditworthy counterparties. Any
market risk associated with these contracts is substantially offset by the
opposite market impact on the related hedged items.

In addition, at year-end 2000, we have equity derivative
contracts with financial institutions in the notional amount of $52 million.
These prepaid forward contracts hedge a portion of our deferred

F-21

compensation
liability which is based on PepsiCo’s stock price. The change in the fair
value of these contracts resulted in $19 million of income during 2000 and $6
million of expense during 1999. These changes in fair value were substantially
offset by opposite changes in the amount of the underlying deferred compensation
liability.

The above carrying amounts are included in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet under the indicated  captions,  except for combined currency
and  interest  rate swaps,  which are  included  in the  appropriate  current or  noncurrent  asset or  liability  caption.  Short-term
investments  consist  primarily of debt  securities  and have been  classified as  held-to-maturity.  Equity  derivative  contracts are
classified  within  prepaid  expenses  and forward  exchange  contracts  are  classified  within  accounts  payable  and other  current
liabilities.

Because of the short maturity of cash equivalents and short-term  investments,  the carrying amounts  approximate fair values. The fair
values of debt,  debt-related  derivative  instruments  and forward  derivative  instruments  were  estimated  using market  quotes and
calculations  based on market rates.  We have  unconditionally  guaranteed  $2.3 billion of Bottling  Group,  LLC's long-term debt. The
guarantee had a fair value of $66 million at December 30, 2000 and $64 million at December 25, 1999 based on market rates.

In 1998, we reached final agreement with the IRS to settle
substantially all remaining aspects of a tax case related to our concentrate
operations in Puerto Rico. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit totaling
$494 million (or $0.32 per share) which reduced our 1998 provision for income
taxes.

Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary
differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported
amounts in the financial statements. We record the tax effect of these temporary
differences as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax
assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
in future years. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that we have
taken a tax deduction for, but have not yet recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $2.9 billion at
year-end 2000 are being carried forward and are available to reduce future
taxable income of certain subsidiaries in a number of foreign and state
jurisdictions. These net operating losses will expire as follows: $0.1 billion in
2001, $2.5 billion between 2002 and 2016 and $0.3 billion may be carried forward
indefinitely.

Valuation allowances have been established primarily for
deferred tax assets related to net operating losses in certain state and foreign
tax jurisdictions where the amount of expected future taxable income from
operations does not support the recognition of these deferred tax assets.

Other additions/deductions include currency translation effect,
and in 1999 the impact of the bottling transactions.

Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized for temporary
differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and in unconsolidated
foreign affiliates that are essentially permanent in duration. It would not be
practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liabilities.

Note 14 - Employee Stock Options

Stock options are granted to employees under two different incentive plans:

•  the SharePower Stock Option Plan (SharePower) and

•  the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).

SharePower

SharePower stock options are granted to essentially all
full-time employees. SharePower options generally have a 10 year term. Beginning
in 1998, the number of SharePower options granted is based on each
employee’s annual earnings and tenure and generally become exercisable
after three years. Prior to 1998, the number of options granted was based on
each employee’s annual earnings and generally became exercisable ratably
over five years.

LTIP

Beginning in 1998, all executive (including middle management)
awards are made under the LTIP. Under the LTIP, an executive generally receives
an award based on a multiple of base salary. Two-thirds of the award consists of
stock options with an exercise price equal to the average stock price on the
date of the award. These options generally become exercisable at the end of
three years and have a 10 year term. At the date of the award, the executive
selects whether the remaining one-third of the award will be granted in stock
options or paid in cash at the end of three years. The number of options granted
or the cash payment, if any, will depend on the attainment of prescribed
performance goals over the three year measurement period. If the executive
chooses stock options, they are granted with an exercise price equal to the
average stock price on the date of the grant, vest immediately and have a 10
year term. If the executive chooses a cash payment, one dollar of cash will be
received for every four dollars of the award. Amounts expensed for expected cash
payments were $36.7 million in 2000, $17.9 million in 1999 and $7 million in
1998. At year-end 2000, 125 million shares were available for grants under the
LTIP.

Prior to 1998

Prior to 1998, Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP) options were
granted to middle management employees and were exercisable after one year. LTIP
options were granted to senior management employees and were generally
exercisable after four years. Both SOIP and LTIP options have 10 year terms.
Certain LTIP options could be exchanged by employees for a specified number of
performance share units (PSUs) within 60 days of the grant date. The value of a
PSU was fixed at the stock price at the grant date and the PSU was payable four
years from the grant date, contingent upon attainment of prescribed performance
goals. At year-end 2000, there were no PSUs outstanding. There were 68,000 and
84,000 PSUs outstanding in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Payment of PSUs was made
in cash and/or in stock as approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board
of Directors. Amounts expensed for PSUs were $0.3 million in 1999 and $1 million
in 1998.

The pro forma amounts disclosed above are not fully
representative of the effects of stock-based awards because, except for the
impact resulting from the bottling transactions, the amounts exclude the pro

Note 15 - Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

Our pension plans cover substantially all full-time U.S.
employees and certain international employees. Benefits depend on years of
service and earnings or are based on stated amounts for each year of service.

Postretirement Benefits

Our postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance
benefits principally to U.S. retirees and their dependents. Employees are
eligible for benefits if they meet age and service requirements and qualify for
retirement benefits.

In 1999, as a result of the
bottling transactions, $717 million of
pension benefit obligation and $205 million of postretirement benefit
obligation were assumed by bottling affiliates. In addition, bottling affiliate
plans assumed ownership of $659 million of pension assets. The net gain on the
bottling transactions includes a curtailment/settlement net loss of $52 million.

Measurement Date

We use a September 30 measurement date.

Components of Pension Assets

The pension plan assets are principally stocks and bonds. These
assets include approximately 4.7 million shares of PepsiCo capital stock with a
fair value of $214 million in 2000 and 6.5 million shares with a fair value of
$198 million in 1999. To maintain diversification, 1.8 million shares of PepsiCo
capital stock were sold in 2000 and .5 million shares were sold in 1999. In
addition, in 1999, PBG pension plans assumed ownership of 3.1 million shares of
PepsiCo capital stock with a fair value of $95 million.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

An average increase of 5.9% in the cost of covered
postretirement medical benefits is assumed for 2001 for employees who retire
without cost sharing. This average increase is then projected to decline
gradually to 5.5% in 2005 and thereafter.

An average increase of 5.5% in the cost of covered
postretirement medical benefits is assumed for 2001 for employees who retire
with cost sharing. This average increase is then projected to decline to zero in
2003 and thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
on the amounts reported for postretirement medical plans. A one percentage point
change in assumed health care costs would have the following effects:

1% Increase      1% Decrease
                                                                 --------------   -------------

Note 16 - Commitments, Contingencies and Leases

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to
lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising out of the normal
course of business. Contingent liabilities primarily reflect guarantees to
support financial arrangements of certain unconsolidated affiliates, including
the unconditional guarantee for $2.3 billion of Bottling Group, LLC’s
long-term debt. We believe that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of
amounts already recognized arising from such claims or contingencies is not
likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition or liquidity.

F-30

We have non-cancelable commitments under both capital and
long-term operating leases, primarily for warehouses, distribution centers and
office space. Capital and operating lease commitments expire at various dates
through 2047 and may provide for renewal or purchase options. Most leases
require payment of related executory costs, which include property taxes,
maintenance and insurance.

non-cancelable leases:

Note 17 - Business Segments

In 1998, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of a Business Enterprise and
Related ted Information

, which is based on management reporting. In
early 1999, in contemplation of the separation from PepsiCo of our bottling
operations, we completed a reorganization of our Pepsi-Cola business.
Accordingly, our 1999 disclosure presents operating results consistent with the
new Pepsi-Cola organization. 1998 amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the 1999 and 2000 presentation. Therefore, the results in 1998 and through the
applicable transaction closing dates in 1999 of consolidated bottling operations
in which we now own an equity interest are presented separately with the 1998
and first quarter 1999 equity income or loss of other unconsolidated bottling
affiliates. From the applicable transaction closing dates in 1999, the equity
income of those previously consolidated bottling operations and the equity
income or loss of other unconsolidated bottling affiliates from the second
quarter of 1999, are presented separately below operating profit in the Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Income. The combined results of our five reportable
segments are referred to as New PepsiCo.

The North American segments include the United States and
Canada. The Tropicana segment includes its international results. Pepsi-Cola
North America results include the North American concentrate and fountain
businesses. Pepsi-Cola International results include the international
concentrate business and consolidated international bottling operations.

Note 19 - Subsequent Event and Proposed Merger

Subsequent Acquisition of South Beach Beverage
Company, Inc.

On January 5, 2001, we completed the acquisition of South Beach
Beverage Company, LLC for approximately $337 million in cash, retaining a 91%
interest in the newly formed South Beach Beverage Company, Inc. (SoBe). SoBe
manufactures and markets an innovative line of alternative non-carbonated
beverages including fruit blends, energy drinks, dairy-based drinks, exotic teas
and other beverages with herbal ingredients, which are distributed under license
by a network of independent distributors, primarily in the United States.

Proposed Merger with The Quaker Oats Company

On December 4, 2000, we announced a merger agreement with The
Quaker Oats Company (Quaker). Under the terms of this agreement, Quaker
shareholders will receive 2.3 shares of PepsiCo capital stock subject to a
maximum value of $105 for each Quaker share. In the event that the value exceeds
$105, the exchange ratio is subject to adjustment. Further, if the value of
PepsiCo shares received by Quaker shareholders for each Quaker share is below
$92, Quaker may terminate the merger agreement. Based on the closing price of
our stock of $42.375 per share on December 1, 2000, the proposed tax-free
transaction is valued at $97.4625 per Quaker share. In conjunction with the
merger agreement, we entered into a stock option agreement with Quaker which
granted us an option, under certain circumstances, to purchase up to
approximately 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Quaker common stock. The
proposed merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including shareholder
approval at both companies, and certain regulatory approvals. The merger is
expected to close in the first half of 2001 and is expected to be accounted for
as a “pooling-of-interests.”

Management’s Responsibility for Financial
Statements

To Our Shareholders:

Management is responsible for the reliability of the
consolidated financial statements and related notes. The financial statements
were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and
include amounts based upon our estimates and assumptions, as required. The
financial statements have been audited by our independent auditors, KPMG LLP,
who were given free access to all financial records and related data, including
minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees of the Board.
We believe that our representations to the independent auditors are valid and
appropriate.

Management maintains a system of internal controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements,
as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The system
is supported by formal policies and procedures, including an active Code of
Conduct program intended to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of
personal and professional integrity. Our internal audit function monitors and
reports on the adequacy of and compliance with the internal control system, and
appropriate actions are taken to address significant control deficiencies and
other opportunities for improving the system as they are identified. The Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors consists solely of directors who are not
salaried employees and who are, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, free
from any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment as a committee member. The Committee meets during the year with
representatives of management, including internal auditors and the independent
accountants to review our financial reporting process and our controls to
safeguard assets. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free
access to the Audit Committee.

Although no cost-effective internal control system will preclude
all errors and irregularities, we believe our controls as of December 30, 2000
provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are reliable and that
our assets are reasonably safeguarded.

Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders

PepsiCo, Inc.

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 30, 2000 and December 25, 1999 and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’
equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2000.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of PepsiCo,
Inc.‘s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 30, 2000 and December 25, 1999,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
