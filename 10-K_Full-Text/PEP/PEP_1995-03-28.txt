                             PART I
Item 1.   Business

      PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in  Delaware
in 1919 and was reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986.  Unless
the  context  indicates  otherwise, when  used  herein  the  term
"PepsiCo"  shall mean the Company and its various  divisions  and
subsidiaries.  PepsiCo is engaged in the following  domestic  and
international   businesses:    beverages,   snack    foods    and
restaurants.

Beverages

      PepsiCo's  beverage business consists of  Pepsi-Cola  North
America ("PCNA") and Pepsi-Cola International ("PCI").

     PCNA manufactures and sells beverages, primarily soft drinks
and  soft  drink concentrates, in the United States  and  Canada.
PCNA  sells its concentrates to licensed independent and company-
owned  bottlers ("Pepsi-Cola bottlers") and to joint ventures  in
which  PepsiCo  participates.  Under appointments  from  PepsiCo,
bottlers   manufacture,  sell  and  distribute,  within   defined
territories, carbonated soft drinks and syrups bearing trademarks
owned by PepsiCo, including PEPSI-COLA, DIET PEPSI, MOUNTAIN DEW,
SLICE,  MUG  and, within Canada, 7UP and DIET 7UP (the  foregoing
are  sometimes  referred  to  as  "Pepsi-Cola  beverages").   The
Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership, a joint venture of PCNA and  Thomas
J.  Lipton  Co., develops and sells tea concentrate to Pepsi-Cola
bottlers  and  develops and markets ready-to-drink  tea  products
under  the  LIPTON trademark.  Such products are  distributed  by
Pepsi-Cola  bottlers  throughout  the  United  States.   A  joint
venture  between PCNA and Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.  develops
new juice products under the OCEAN SPRAY trademark.  Pursuant  to
a separate distribution agreement, Pepsi-Cola bottlers distribute
single-serve  sizes of OCEAN SPRAY juice products throughout  the
United States.

      Pepsi-Cola beverages are manufactured in approximately  200
plants  located  throughout the United States and  Canada.   PCNA
operates  approximately  65 plants and  manufactures,  sells  and
distributes  beverages  throughout  approximately  160   licensed
territories,  accounting for approximately 56% of the  Pepsi-Cola
beverages  sold  in the United States and Canada.   Approximately
135  plants  are  operated  by  independent  licensees  or  joint
ventures in which PCNA participates, which manufacture, sell  and
distribute approximately 44% of the Pepsi-Cola beverages sold  in
the United States and Canada.  PCNA has a minority interest in  6
of   these   licensees,  comprising  approximately  70   licensed
territories.

      PCI  manufactures  and  sells soft drinks  and  soft  drink
concentrates outside the United States and Canada.  PCI sells its
concentrates  to  Pepsi-Cola bottlers and to  joint  ventures  in
which  PepsiCo  participates.  Under appointments  from  PepsiCo,
bottlers   manufacture,  sell  and  distribute,  within   defined
territories, Pepsi-Cola beverages bearing PEPSI-COLA, DIET PEPSI,
MIRINDA,  PEPSI  MAX, 7UP, DIET 7UP and other trademarks.   There
are approximately 530 plants outside the United States and Canada
bottling   PepsiCo's  beverage  products.   These  products   are
available  in  195 foreign countries and territories.   Principal
international  markets include Mexico, Saudi  Arabia,  Argentina,
Spain, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Venezuela, Brazil and China.

      PCNA  and  PCI  make programs available to assist  licensed
bottlers in servicing markets, expanding operations and improving
production  methods  and facilities.  PCNA  and  PCI  also  offer
assistance  to  bottlers  in  the distribution,  advertising  and
marketing  of  their products and offer sales assistance  through
special  merchandising and promotional programs and  by  training
bottler  personnel.   PCNA  and PCI  maintain  control  over  the
composition   and  quality  of  beverages  sold   under   PepsiCo
trademarks.



Snack Foods

      PepsiCo's  snack food business consists of Frito-Lay  North
America ("Frito-Lay") and PepsiCo Foods International ("PFI").

      Frito-Lay  manufactures and sells a varied  line  of  snack
foods  throughout the United States and Canada, including  FRITOS
brand  corn chips, LAY'S (in the United States) and RUFFLES brand
potato  chips,   DORITOS  and  TOSTITOS  brands  tortilla  chips,
CHEE.TOS  brand cheese flavored snacks, ROLD GOLD brand  pretzels,
SMARTFOOD  brand  cheese  flavored  popcorn  and  SUNCHIPS  brand
multigrain snacks.

      Frito-Lay's products are transported from its manufacturing
plants to major distribution centers throughout the United States
and  Canada,  principally  by  company-owned  trucks.   Frito-Lay
utilizes  a  "store-door-delivery"  system,  whereby  its  14,600
person  sales  force delivers the snacks directly  to  the  store
shelf.   This  system  permits Frito-Lay  to  work  closely  with
approximately  466,000 retail trade customers weekly  and  to  be
responsive  to  their  needs.  Frito-Lay believes  this  form  of
distribution  is a valuable marketing tool and is  essential  for
the proper distribution of products with a short shelf life.

      PFI manufactures and markets snack foods outside the United
States  and  Canada  through company-owned facilities  and  joint
ventures.   On  most of the European continent,  PepsiCo's  snack
food  business consists of Snack Ventures Europe, a joint venture
between PepsiCo and General Mills, Inc., in which PepsiCo owns  a
60%  interest.   Many  of  PFI's snack  food  products,  such  as
SABRITAS  brand potato chips in Mexico, are similar in  taste  to
Frito-Lay snacks sold in the United States and Canada.  PFI  also
sells  a  variety  of snack food products which appeal  to  local
tastes  including, for example WALKERS CRISPS, which are sold  in
the  United  Kingdom,  and GAMESA cookies and  SONRIC'S  candies,
which  are  sold  in  Mexico.   In  addition,  RUFFLES,  CHEE.TOS,
DORITOS,  FRITOS  and  SUNCHIPS  brand  snack  foods  have   been
introduced  to  international markets.   Principal  international
markets  include  Mexico,  the  United  Kingdom,  Spain,  Brazil,
Poland, the Netherlands, France, and Australia.

Restaurants

     PepsiCo's worldwide restaurant business principally consists
of Pizza Hut, Inc. ("Pizza Hut"),  Taco Bell Corp. ("Taco Bell"),

3,200  TACO  BELL outlets in the United States and 70 in  Canada.
Franchisees operate approximately 1,500 additional restaurants in
the  United States.  Licensees operate approximately 930  special
concept outlets in the United States and 30 in Canada.

     KFC is engaged principally in the operation, development and
franchising  of  a  system  of carryout and  dine-in  restaurants
featuring  chicken and operating under the names  KENTUCKY  FRIED
CHICKEN  and/or  KFC.   KFC  (through  its  subsidiaries   and/or
affiliates)  operates  approximately  2,000  restaurants  in  the
United   States   and   250  in  Canada.    Franchisees   operate
approximately  3,000 additional restaurants in the United  States
and  600  in Canada.  Licensees operate approximately 100 outlets
in  the  United States.  KFC restaurants are located in 48 states
and throughout Canada.



      PRI is engaged principally in the operation and development
of casual dining and fast-service restaurants, delivery units and
kiosks  which  sell PIZZA HUT, KFC and, to a lesser extent,  TACO
BELL products outside the United States and Canada.  PRI operates
approximately 800 PIZZA HUT restaurants, delivery/carryout  units
and  kiosks, franchisees operate approximately 1,200 units,  and
joint  ventures  in which PRI participates operate  approximately
460  units.  PIZZA HUT units are located in a total of 83 foreign

markets  include  Australia, the United Kingdom,  Spain,  Brazil,
Mexico and South Korea.  PRI also operates approximately 850  KFC
restaurants  and kiosks, franchisees operate approximately  2,150
restaurants  and  kiosks,  and  joint  ventures  in   which   PRI
participates  operate approximately 400 restaurants  and  kiosks.
KFC  units  are  located in 71 foreign countries and  territories
(exclusive  of  Canada),  and principal  markets  include  Japan,
Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Mexico and Malaysia.
PRI  also  operates  approximately  20  TACO  BELL  outlets,  and
franchisees  operate approximately 35 outlets, in a total  of  15
foreign countries and territories (exclusive of Canada).

      PepsiCo  also owns, operates, or participates  as  a  joint
venturer  in a number of other restaurant concepts in the  United

of  food,  supplies and equipment to company-owned,  franchised and
licensed PIZZA HUT, TACO BELL and KFC restaurants in the United States,
Australia, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Poland.

Competition

       All   of  PepsiCo's  businesses  are  highly  competitive.
PepsiCo's  beverages  and  snack foods compete  domestically  and
internationally with widely distributed products of a  number  of
major  companies  that have plants in many of the  areas  PepsiCo
serves, as well as with private label soft drinks and snack foods
and  with  the  products  of  local and  regional  manufacturers.
PepsiCo's  restaurants compete domestically  and  internationally
with  other restaurants, restaurant chains, food outlets and home
delivery    operations.     PFS   competes    domestically    and
internationally with other food distribution companies.  For  all
of PepsiCo's industry segments, the main areas of competition are
price, quality and variety of products, and customer service.

Employees

      At December 31, 1994, PepsiCo employed, subject to seasonal
variations, approximately 471,000 persons (including 282,000 part-
time employees), of whom approximately 340,000 (including 228,000
part-time  employees)  were employed within  the  United  States.
PepsiCo  believes that its relations with employees are generally
good.

Raw Materials and Other Supplies

      The  principal materials used by PepsiCo in  its  beverage,
snack  food and restaurant businesses are corn sweeteners, sugar,
aspartame,  flavorings, vegetable and essential  oils,  potatoes,
corn,  flour,  tomato  products, pinto  beans,  lettuce,  cheese,
butter, beef, pork and chicken products, seasonings and packaging
materials.  Since PepsiCo relies on trucks to move and distribute
many  of  its  products,  fuel is also  an  important  commodity.
PepsiCo  employs specialists to secure adequate supplies of  many
of these items and has not experienced any significant continuous
shortages.  Prices paid by PepsiCo for such items are subject  to
fluctuation.  When prices increase, PepsiCo may or may  not  pass
on  such increases to its customers.  Generally, when PepsiCo has
decided   to  pass  along  price  increases,  it  has   done   so
successfully.  There is no assurance that PepsiCo will be able to
do so in the future.

Governmental Regulations

      The  conduct  of PepsiCo's businesses, and the  production,
distribution  and  use of many of its products,  are  subject  to
various  federal laws, such as the Food, Drug and  Cosmetic  Act,
the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act 



and the  Americans  with Disabilities  Act.  The conduct of PepsiCo's 
businesses  is  also subject to local, state and foreign laws.


Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Franchises

       PepsiCo  owns  numerous  valuable  trademarks  which   are
essential  to  PepsiCo's worldwide businesses,  including  PEPSI-
COLA, PEPSI, DIET PEPSI, PEPSI MAX, MOUNTAIN DEW, SLICE, MUG, 7UP
and  DIET  7UP  (outside the United States), MIRINDA,  FRITO-LAY,
DORITOS,  RUFFLES,  LAY'S, FRITOS, CHEE.TOS,  SANTITAS,  SUNCHIPS,
TOSTITOS,  ROLD  GOLD, GRANDMA'S, SMARTFOOD,  SABRITAS,  WALKERS,
PIZZA HUT, TACO BELL, KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN and KFC.  Trademarks
remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification
purposes,  and PepsiCo emphasizes correct use of its  trademarks.
PepsiCo   has   authorized   (through  licensing   or   franchise
arrangements) the use of some of its trademarks in such  contexts
as  Pepsi-Cola  bottling appointments, snack food joint  ventures
and  wholly licensed operations and Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and  KFC
franchise agreements.  In addition, PepsiCo licenses the  use  of
its trademarks on collateral products for the primary purpose  of
enhancing brand awareness.

      PepsiCo  either  owns or has licenses to use  a  number  of
patents which relate to certain of its products and the processes
for  their production and to the design and operation of  various
equipment  used  in  its businesses.  Some of these  patents  are
licensed to others.

Research and Development

      PepsiCo spent approximately $152 million, $113 million  and
$102  million on research and development activities  during  the
years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Environmental Matters

      PepsiCo  continues to make expenditures in order to  comply
with  federal,  state, local and foreign environmental  laws  and
regulations,  which  expenditures have  not  been  material  with
respect   to  PepsiCo's  capital  expenditures,  net  income   or
competitive position.

Business Segments

       Information  as  to  net  sales,  operating  profits   and
identifiable  assets  for  each of PepsiCo's  industry  segments,
restaurant  chains and major geographic areas of  operations,  as
well  as  capital  spending,  acquisitions  and  investments   in
affiliates,  amortization of intangible assets  and  depreciation
expense for each industry segment and restaurant chain, for 1994,
1993  and  1992 is contained in Item 8 "Financial Statements  and

believes  that  the  ultimate liability, if  any,  in  excess  of
amounts   already   provided  arising   from   such   claims   or
contingencies is not likely to have a material adverse effect  on
PepsiCo's annual results of operations or financial condition.

Item 7.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Management's Analysis - Overview

     To enhance understanding of PepsiCo's financial performance,
the  various  components of Management's Analysis  are  presented
near   the  pertinent  financial  statements.   Accordingly,   in
addition  to this overview, separate analyses of the  results  of
operations,  financial condition and cash flows appear  on  pages
11, 12 and 14. respectively.  Also, the analysis of each industry
segment's  net sales and operating profit performance  begins  on
pages  15, 19 and 22.

     Marketplace Actions

          PepsiCo's domestic and international businesses operate
in  markets that are highly competitive and subject to global and
local  economic  conditions including inflation, commodity  price
and  currency fluctuations and governmental actions.  In  Mexico,
for  example,  our businesses have benefited in past  years  from
improving conditions.  Conversely, the significant devaluation of
the Mexican peso at the end of 1994 and continuing into 1995 will
not  only negatively impact reported earnings from Mexico due  to
translation,  but  is  expected to create a much  less  favorable
economic  climate in the country.  Other examples  include  risks
associated   with   political   instability   and   its   related
dislocations  in  countries where PepsiCo operates  and  possible
employee  benefit or minimum wage legislation  in  the  U.S.  and
elsewhere,   increasing  the  cost  of  providing  benefits   and
compensation  to  employees.  PepsiCo's operating  and  investing
strategies  are  designed,  where  possible,  to  mitigate  these
factors  through aggressive actions on several fronts  including:
(a)  enhancing the appeal and value of its products through brand
promotion,  product innovation, quality improvement  and  prudent
pricing  actions; (b) providing better service to customers;  (c)
increasing worldwide availability of its products; (d)  acquiring
businesses and forming alliances to increase market presence  and
utilize  resources  more efficiently; and  (e)  containing  costs
through   efficient  and  effective  purchasing,   manufacturing,
distribution and administrative processes.

     Restructurings

            Restructuring  actions  realign  resources  for  more
efficient and effective execution of operating strategies.  As  a
result,  PepsiCo continually considers and executes restructuring
actions  that vary in size and impact, for example, from a  minor
sales  force  reorganization at a local facility to a significant
organizational and process redesign affecting an entire operating
division.   The resulting cost savings or profits from  increased
sales  are  reinvested  in  the business  to  increase  PepsiCo's
shareholder value.  Major restructuring actions announced in 1992
and  now  underway or completed in the beverage and international
snack  food segments resulted in charges totaling $193.5  million
($128.5  million after-tax or $0.16 per share).  In  1994,  $28.3
million ($17.4 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) of the  1992
restructuring  accruals  were  reversed  into  income,  primarily
reflecting refinements of the original domestic beverage  accrual
estimate  and  management's decision to reduce the scope  of  the
domestic  beverage  restructuring.  The majority  of  the  amount
reversed into income was offset by additional charges in 1994 for
new  actions.   The remaining accruals for the 1992 restructuring
actions  of  $39  million outstanding at year-end 1994  represent
expected cash payments of which $25 million, $11 million  and  $3
million  are  expected  to  be  paid  in  1995,  1996  and  1997,
respectively.

            Annual  cost  savings  from  the  1992  restructuring
actions, when fully implemented, are expected to be approximately
$75  million primarily from reduced employee and facility  costs.
In  addition,  while difficult to measure, the domestic  beverage
segment  is also expected to benefit by an estimated $90  million
annually   from  centralization  of  purchasing  activities   and
incremental    volume   and   pricing   from   improvements    in
administrative  and  business  processes.   The  combined   gross
benefits realized in 1994 from the 1992 restructuring actions are
estimated  to  be approximately $50 million.  These benefits  are
expected to increase annually until fully realized in 1998.   See
Notes  2  and  16  for  additional detail  related  to  the  1992
restructuring charges.  See Management's Analysis of beverage and
snack  food performance on pages 15 and 19, respectively,  for  a
discussion   of  the  1992  restructuring  charges  and   related
anticipated benefits.




     Derivatives

          PepsiCo uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce
borrowing   costs   and   hedge  future  purchases   of   certain
commodities.    PepsiCo's  policy  is  to  not   use   derivative
instruments for speculative purposes and has procedures in  place
to  monitor and control their use.  PepsiCo's credit risk related
to  derivatives is considered low.  Financing-related  derivative
contracts   are  only  entered  into  with  strong   creditworthy
counterparties  and are generally of relatively  short  duration.
Purchases  of  commodities  are  hedged  with  commodity  futures
contracts traded on national exchanges.

           Reduce  Borrowing Costs:  PepsiCo enters into interest
rate  and  foreign  currency  swaps  to  effectively  change  the
interest  rate and currency of specific debt issuances  with  the
objective of reducing borrowing costs.  These swaps are generally
entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt they  are
intended  to  modify.  The notional value, payment  and  maturity
dates  of  the swaps match the principal, interest payment  dates
and  maturity dates of the related debt.  Accordingly, any market
impact (risk or opportunity) associated with these swaps is fully
offset  by  the opposite market impact on the related debt.   See
Notes 9 and 10 for additional details regarding interest rate and
currency swaps.

          Hedge Commodity Costs:  PepsiCo hedges future commodity
purchases when we believe it will result in lower net costs.  The
futures  contracts entered into do not exceed expected usage  nor
do  they generally extend beyond one year.  While PepsiCo expects
to  generate  lower commodity costs over time  by  entering  into
these  futures contracts, it is possible that the commodity costs
will  be higher than if futures contracts were not entered  into.
we  believe it has the ability to raise prices if commodity
prices  increase;  however, it expects  to  do  so  only  if  the
increase  is other than temporary and it would not place  PepsiCo
at  a  competitive disadvantage.  Open contracts at year-end 1994
and  gains  and losses realized in 1994 or deferred  at  year-end
were not significant.

     Currency Exchange Effects

           In  1994,  1993  and  1992,  international  businesses
represented  18.6%, 18.0% and 17.7%, respectively,  of  PepsiCo's
total  segment  operating  profits.  Operating  in  international
markets   sometimes  involves  volatile  movements  in   currency
exchange  rates.  The economic impact of currency  exchange  rate
movements  on PepsiCo is complex because such changes  are  often
linked  to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates,
governmental  actions  and  other factors.   In  addition,  these
changes,  if material, can cause PepsiCo to adjust its  financing
and  operating  strategies, for example, pricing,  promotion  and
product  strategies  and  decisions concerning  sourcing  of  raw
materials and packaging.  Because PepsiCo operates in  a  mix  of
businesses  and numerous countries, management believes  currency
exposures  are  fairly  well diversified.   Moreover,  management
believes that currency exposures are not a significant factor  in
competition   at   the  local  market  operating   level.    When
economically  appropriate, however, PepsiCo enters  into  foreign
currency  hedges  to  minimize  specific  cash  flow  transaction
exposures.   The  following paragraphs describe  the  effects  of
currency  exchange rate movements on PepsiCo's reported  results.
See Other Factors Expected to Impact 1995 Results on page 10.

           As  currency exchange rates change, translation of the
income  statements of international businesses into U.S.  dollars
affects  year-over-year comparability of operating  results.   In
1994  and 1993, sales and operating profit growth rates  for  our
consolidated   international  businesses  were   not   materially
impacted  by  the  translation effects  of  changes  in  currency
exchange  rates.   The  effects on  comparability  of  sales  and
operating   profits  arising  from  translation  of  the   income
statements  of  international businesses  are  identified,  where
material, in Management's Analysis of segment operating  results.
These  translation effects exclude the impact  of  businesses  in
highly  inflationary countries, where the functional currency  is
the U.S. dollar.

           Changes  in  currency exchange rates  also  result  in
reported foreign exchange gains and losses which are included  as
a  component of unallocated expenses, net (see pages F-12 and  F-
13).   PepsiCo  reported  a net foreign  exchange  gain  of  $4.5
million in 1994 compared to net foreign exchange losses of  $41.2
million and $17.4 



million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.   These reported  amounts  include 
translation gains and  losses  arising from  remeasurement into U.S. 
dollars of the net monetary  assets of  businesses  in  highly  
inflationary countries  as  well  as transaction gains and losses.  
Transaction gains and losses arise from   monetary   assets  such  as  
receivables  and short-term investments  as well as payables (including 
debt) denominated  in currencies other than a business unit's functional 
currency.   In implementing  strategies to minimize after-tax  financing  
costs, the  effects of expected currency exchange rate movements on debt
and  short-term  investments are considered  along  with  related
interest rates in measuring effective net financing costs.

           Beginning in 1993, Mexico was no longer categorized as
highly  inflationary.  PepsiCo did not calculate the net  foreign
exchange  gain or loss that would have been reported in 1993  had
businesses  in  Mexico been accounted for as highly inflationary;
however,  translation gains and losses for businesses  in  Mexico
were not a significant component of the above 1992 amount.

Certain Factors Affecting Comparability

     Accounting Changes

           PepsiCo's  financial statements  reflect  the  noncash
impact of accounting changes adopted in 1994 and 1992.  In  1994,
PepsiCo  was required to adopt Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  112,  "Employers' Accounting  for  Postemployment
Benefits"  (SFAS  112).  The cumulative effect of  adopting  SFAS
112,  an  $84.6 million charge ($55.3 million after-tax or  $0.07
per  share),  principally represented estimated future  severance
costs  related to services provided by employees prior  to  1994.
As  compared to the previous accounting method, the current  year
impact  of  adopting SFAS 112 was immaterial  to  1994  operating
profits.  See Note 14 for additional details.

           Also  in 1994, PepsiCo adopted a preferred method  for
calculating  the  market-related value of  plan  assets  used  in
determining  the  return-on-asset  component  of  annual  pension
expense  and the cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss subject
to  amortization.  The cumulative effect of adopting this change,
which  related  to  years prior to 1994, was a benefit  of  $37.8
million  ($23.3  million  after-tax  or  $0.03  per  share).   As
compared  to  the previous accounting method, the change  reduced
1994 pension expense by $35.1 million ($21.6 million after-tax or
$0.03 per share).  See Note 13 for additional details.

           Effective the beginning of 1992, PepsiCo early adopted
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS
106), and No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109).  The
cumulative  effect of adopting SFAS 106, a $575.3 million  charge
($356.7  million  after-tax  or  $0.44  per  share),  represented
estimated future retiree health benefit costs related to services
provided  by employees prior to 1992.   The cumulative effect  of
adopting SFAS 109, a $570.7 million tax charge ($0.71 per share),
primarily represented the recognition of additional deferred  tax
liabilities related to acquired identifiable intangible assets as
of  the  beginning of 1992.  See Notes 12 and 17  for  additional
details  regarding  the  adoption  of  SFAS  106  and  SFAS  109,
respectively.

     Other Factors

           Comparisons  of  1994  to  1993  are  affected  by  an
additional week of results in the 1994 reporting period.  Because
PepsiCo's  fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in  December,  a
fifty-third  week is added every 5 or 6 years.   The  fifty-third
week increased 1994 earnings by an estimated $54.0 million ($34.9
million  after-tax  or  $0.04 per share).   See  Items  Affecting
Comparability,  Fiscal  Year, on  page  F-9  for  the  impact  on
PepsiCo's business segments.

           PepsiCo  recorded a one-time, noncash  gain  of  $17.8
million  ($16.8  million after-tax or $0.02 per share)  resulting
from  a  public share offering by BAESA, a bottling joint venture
in South America.  See Note 4 for additional details.



     Significant U.S. Tax Changes Affecting Historical and Future
Results

           U.S.  federal income tax legislation enacted in August
1993  included  a  provision for a 1% statutory income  tax  rate
increase  effective  for the full year.  As required  under  SFAS
109, the increase in the tax rate resulted in a noncash charge of
$29.9  million  ($0.04  per  share) for  the  adjustment  of  net
deferred tax liabilities as of the beginning of 1993.

           The 1993 tax legislation also included a provision  to
reduce  the  tax  credit  associated  with  beverage  concentrate
operations in Puerto Rico.  This change limited the tax credit on
income  earned  in Puerto Rico in the first year to  60%  of  the
amount allowed under the previous tax law, with the limit further
reduced  ratably  over  the following four  years  to  40%.   The
provision,  which  became effective for PepsiCo's  operations  on
December 1, 1994, had an immaterial impact on 1994 earnings.  Had
the provision become effective at the beginning of 1994, earnings
for the year would have been reduced by approximately $60 million
or  $0.07  per share.  Similarly, had the 40% credit  limit  been
effective  in  1994,  earnings would  have  been  reduced  by  an
additional  $30  million or $0.04 per share over the  60%  credit
limit.

          In 1994, the U.S. Department of the Treasury proposed a
change  to  a  current regulation (known as Q&A 12), which  would
further  reduce the tax incentives associated with  the  beverage
concentrate operations in Puerto Rico.  This proposal applies  to
PepsiCo's sales of concentrate from its operations in Puerto Rico
to  its  related bottlers in the U.S.  If it had been adopted  as
proposed  in  1994,  the change would have become  effective  for
PepsiCo  on  December 1, 1994 with an immaterial impact  on  1994
earnings.   However, had the 60% credit limit  (discussed  above)
and the currently proposed Q&A 12 been in effect at the beginning
of  1994,  earnings for the year would have been  reduced  by  an
estimated  $112 million or $0.14 per share.  Had the  40%  credit
limit and proposed Q&A 12 both been effective in 1994, the impact
would  have  reduced 1994 earnings for the year by an  additional
$30  million or $0.04 per share over the 60% credit  limit.   The
estimated impacts are subject to change depending upon the  final
provisions  of  Q&A  12,  if enacted.   PepsiCo  and  others  are
vigorously opposing the proposed change.

           PepsiCo's  full year 1995 tax rate is not expected  to
exceed  35%.  The expected tax rate reflects PepsiCo's forecasted
1995 mix of U.S. and generally lower taxed foreign earnings,  the
reduction  in  the  tax credit on income earned  in  Puerto  Rico
resulting  from  the 1993 U.S. tax legislation  and  the  assumed
enactment  in  1995  of Q&A 12, as currently proposed,  partially
offset  by  significant  adjustments reflecting  the  anticipated
resolution in 1995 of audit issues related to prior years.

           The  unfavorable effect of Q&A 12 will not be included
in  the  1995  effective  tax rate unless  it  is  enacted.   The
benefits due to the adjustments will be included in the 1995  tax
rate  when  the  audit issues related to prior  years  have  been
resolved.   Accordingly, the potential exists for  volatility  in
PepsiCo's  1995  quarterly effective tax rates depending  on  the
timing of these events, as well as other factors.

Other Factors Expected to Impact 1995 Results

      In  late  1994  and early 1995, the Mexican  peso  devalued
significantly relative to the U.S. dollar.  The primary impact of
the  devaluation on 1994 financial results was an estimated  $275
million unfavorable change in the currency translation adjustment
account  in  Shareholders' Equity, representing the reduced  book
value  of  PepsiCo's Mexican peso-denominated  net  assets.   The
impact  on 1994 earnings was immaterial.  Quantifying the adverse
impact  of  the devaluation on 1995 operating results,  financial
condition and cash flows is difficult because, in addition to the
translation impact, the devaluation is likely to result  in  many
changes to the business environment including government actions,
accelerated inflation and its impact on prices and costs, reduced
consumer  demand and the impact of higher interest rates  on  our
trade customers and bottlers.  Although PepsiCo expects to report
lower  earnings  in 1995 from its operations in  Mexico  than  it
otherwise  would have because of the devaluation and its  related
effects, PepsiCo has begun to take actions in Mexico and in other
parts  of  the  world to mitigate the effects of the devaluation.
PepsiCo's operations in Mexico, primarily related to snack foods,
constituted  about 5% and 7% of PepsiCo's 1994  consolidated  net
assets   and  cash  flows  from  operations,  respectively,   and
contributed  7%  and 8% of PepsiCo's 1994 net sales  and  segment
operating  profits, respectively.  See Management's  Analysis  of
each  industry  



segment for additional discussion  regarding  the impact  of  the  
devaluation of the Mexican peso.   In  addition, PepsiCo  anticipates that 
earnings from its affiliates in  Mexico accounted  for  by  the  equity  
method,  primarily  related   to beverages,  will  also be unfavorably 
impacted.   Equity  results reported in 1994 from affiliates in Mexico were 
not material.

      As  quantified  in Other Factors on page 9, comparisons  of
1995  to 1994 will be adversely affected by the additional week's
results in the 1994 fiscal year.

Management's Analysis - Results of Operations

(See  Management's Analysis - Overview on page 7  for  background
information and Business Segments on page F-9 for detail of segment
results.)

      To  improve  comparability, Management's Analysis  includes
analytical data to indicate the impact of beverage and snack food
acquisitions,  net  of  operations sold or contributed  to  joint
ventures (collectively, "net acquisitions").  Acquisition impacts
represent  the results of the acquired businesses for periods  in
the current year corresponding to the prior year periods that did
not  include  the  results of the businesses.   Restaurant  units
acquired, principally from franchisees, and constructed units are
treated   the  same  for  purposes  of  this  analysis  and   are
collectively referred to as "additional restaurant units."  Also,
the  analysis indicates, as applicable, the impact of the ongoing
effects of the 1994 accounting changes (see Notes 13 and 14), the
1994 BAESA gain (see Note 4), the 1993 deferred tax charge due to
U.S.  tax  legislation (see Note 17) and the  1992  restructuring
charges  (see Note 16), collectively referred to as "the  Unusual
Items."

      Comparisons of 1994 to 1993 were impacted by an  additional
week's results in 1994 which contributed about $433.5 million  or
2  points to growth in Net Sales and increased earnings by  about
$54.0 million ($34.9 million after-tax or $0.04 per share).

      Net  Sales  rose $3.5 billion or 14% in 1994 of which  $215
million  or  1  point was contributed by net  acquisitions.   The
balance  of  the increase reflected volume gains of $2.2  billion
and  $934 million due to additional restaurant units.  Sales grew
$3.1  billion or 14% in 1993.  Net acquisitions contributed  $1.1
billion or 5 points to sales growth.  The balance of the increase
reflected  $913 million from additional restaurant units,  volume
gains   that   contributed  $850  million  and  higher   pricing.
International  sales grew 23% in 1994 and 24% in  1993  with  net
acquisitions  contributing 1 point and 16  points,  respectively.
International sales represented 29%, 27% and 25% of  total  sales
in  1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The long-term trend of an
increasing international component of sales may be interrupted in
the  near  term  as  a result of the unfavorable  impact  of  the
devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994 and early  1995  and
its related effects.

      Cost of sales as a percentage of Net Sales was 48.2%, 47.7%
and  48.3% in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The decline  in
the  1994  gross  margin  reflected a mix shift  to  lower-margin
businesses  in international beverages and worldwide  restaurants
and lower net pricing in domestic beverages, partially offset  by
a   mix   shift   to  higher-margin  packages  and  products   in
international  snack  foods  and  manufacturing  efficiencies  in
domestic  snack  foods.   The 1993 gross margin  improvement  was
driven  by  lower  product costs (packaging and  ingredients)  in
domestic beverages.

      Selling,  general and administrative expenses rose  14%  in
1994 and 13% in 1993, reflecting base business growth.  Excluding
the  Unusual Items, Selling, general and administrative  expenses
rose  14%  in  1994 and 16% in 1993, and as a percentage  of  Net
Sales  were  39.6%,  39.4%  and 38.8% in  1994,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.   In  1994,  Selling,  general  and  administrative
expenses  grew at the same rate as sales.  In 1993,  selling  and
distribution  expenses  grew at a faster  rate  than  sales,  but
marketing  expenditures  grew at a slower  rate.   These  changes
reflect  the impact of worldwide bottling acquisitions  and  flat
marketing expenditures in domestic beverages.

     Amortization of intangible assets rose 3% in 1994 and 14% in
1993.   This  noncash  expense reduced Net Income  Per  Share  by
$0.29, $0.28 and $0.24 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.




      Operating  Profit increased 10% in 1994 and  23%  in  1993.
Excluding  the  Unusual  Items, operating profit  increased  $262
million or 9% in 1994 and $342 million or 13% in 1993, driven  by
combined segment operating profit growth of 7% in 1994 and 14% in
1993.   The  1994  increase reflected $850  million  from  higher
volumes  and  $73  million  from  additional  restaurant   units,
partially  offset by higher operating expenses.  Growth  in  1993
reflected  $425 million from higher volumes and $89 million  from
additional  restaurant  units,  partially  offset  by   increased
operating  expenses.  International segment profits grew  12%  in
1994  and 8% in 1993, reflecting double-digit increases in  snack
foods  and beverages, partially offset by a double-digit  decline
in  restaurants.  International profits represented 19%, 18%  and
19% of combined segment operating profits in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  This percentage may be affected in the  near  term
due  to  the  devaluation of the Mexican  peso  and  its  related
effects.  Small foreign exchange gains in 1994 compared to 1993's
foreign  exchange losses, and increased equity in net  income  of
affiliates, which are not included in segment profits, aided 1994
total operating profit growth.

     Gain on Joint Venture Stock Offering of $17.8 million ($16.8
million  after-tax  or  $0.02 per share) related  to  the  public
offering of shares by the BAESA joint venture.  See Note 4.

      Interest expense, net of Interest income, increased 15%  in
1994  and 2% in 1993.  The 1994 increase reflected higher average
borrowings   partially  offset  by  higher  interest   rates   on
investment balances.  The change in 1993 reflected higher average
borrowings  and  lower  average  short-term  investment  balances
partially  offset by lower interest rates.  Excluding the  impact
of  net acquisitions, net interest expense increased 10% in  1994
and declined 9% in 1993.

      Provision for Income Taxes as a percentage of pretax income
was  33.0%, 34.5% and 31.4% in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
The  1993  effective tax rate, excluding the  Unusual  Item,  was
33.3%.   The  slight  decline  in  1994  reflected  reversal   of
valuation  allowances  related to  deferred  tax  assets  and  an
increase in the proportion of income taxed at lower foreign rates
offset  by the absence of 1993's favorable adjustment of  certain
prior  year  foreign accruals.  The 1993 increase of  1.9  points
reflected  higher  U.S.  and  foreign  effective  tax  rates,  an
increase in the proportion of income taxed at the higher U.S. tax
rate  and  higher state taxes, partially offset by the  favorable
adjustment of prior year accruals.

      Income  and  Income Per Share Before Cumulative  Effect  of
Accounting  Changes  ("income" and "income per  share")  in  1994
increased 12% to $1.8 billion and 13% to $2.22, respectively, and
in  1993  increased  22%  to  $1.6  billion  and  22%  to  $1.96,
respectively.  Excluding the Unusual Items, income and income per
share  rose  8% and 9%, respectively, in 1994 and  13%  and  12%,
respectively, in 1993.  Growth in income per share was  depressed
by  estimated dilution from acquisitions of $0.03 or 1  point  in
1994   and  $0.05  or  3  points  in  1993,  primarily   due   to
international beverage acquisitions in both years.

      The  Mexican  peso devaluation may unfavorably  impact  Net
Sales  and Net Income in 1995; however, due to many uncertainties
in  Mexico, we  are unable to quantify  the  impacts.   See
Management's Analysis - Overview on page 7 and pages 15 , 19  and
22   for  each  industry  segment for  discussion  regarding  the
impacts.

Management's Analysis - Financial Condition

(See  Management's Analysis - Overview on page 7  for  background
information.)

      Assets  increased $1.1 billion or 5% over 1993.  Short-term
investments  largely  represent high-grade marketable  securities
portfolios  held outside the U.S.  The portfolio in Puerto  Rico,
which  totaled $853 million at year-end 1994 and $1.3 billion  at
year-end  1993,  arises  from the operating  cash  flows  of  the
centralized  concentrate  manufacturing  facility  that  operates
under  a  tax  incentive  grant.  The  grant  provides  that  the
portfolio  funds  may  be  remitted  to  the  U.S.  without   any
additional  tax.  PepsiCo remitted $380 million of the  portfolio
to   the  U.S.  in  1994  and  $564  million  in  1993.   PepsiCo
continually reassesses its alternatives to redeploy its  maturing
investments in this and other portfolios held outside  the  U.S.,
considering  other  investment  opportunities  and   risks,   tax
consequences and overall financing strategies.



     Liabilities rose $569 million or 3% over 1993.  Income taxes
payable  decreased $152 million or 18%, reflecting the prepayment
of  taxes  in  1994  related  to  a  federal  tax  audit.   Other
liabilities   increased  $510  million  or  38%,   reflecting   a
reclassification  of  amounts  from  Other  current  liabilities,
normal  growth  in  long-term liabilities and  recognition  of  a
liability for postemployment benefits under SFAS 112.

      At  year-end 1994 and 1993, $4.5 billion and $3.5  billion,
respectively, of short-term borrowings were classified  as  long-
term,  reflecting  PepsiCo's  intent  and  ability,  through  the
existence of its unused revolving credit facilities, to refinance
these  borrowings.   PepsiCo's  unused  credit  facilities   with
lending   institutions,  which  exist  largely  to  support   the
issuances of short-term borrowings, were $3.5 billion at year-end
1994  and 1993.  Effective January 3, 1995, PepsiCo replaced  its
existing credit facilities with new credit facilities aggregating
$4.5  billion,  of  which $1.0 billion expire in  1996  and  $3.5
billion  expire  in  2000.   Annually, these  facilities  can  be
extended  an additional year upon the mutual consent  of  PepsiCo
and the lending institutions.

      Financial Leverage is measured by PepsiCo on both a  market
value and historical cost basis.  PepsiCo believes that the  most
meaningful  measure of debt is on a net basis, which  takes  into
account  its  large investment portfolios held outside  the  U.S.
These  portfolios  are  managed  as  part  of  PepsiCo's  overall
financing  strategy  and are not required to  support  day-to-day
operations.   Net debt reflects the pro forma remittance  of  the
portfolios  (net of related taxes) as a reduction of total  debt.
Total   debt  includes  the  present  value  of  operating  lease
commitments.

      PepsiCo believes that market leverage (defined as net  debt
as  a  percent of net debt plus the market value of equity, based
on  the  year-end  stock  price) is  an  appropriate  measure  of
PepsiCo's  financial leverage.  Unlike historical cost  measures,
the  market value of equity primarily reflects the estimated  net
present  value  of  expected future cash  flows  that  will  both
support debt and provide returns to shareholders.  The market net
debt  ratio  was  26% at year-end 1994 and 22% at year-end  1993.
The  increase was due to a 13% decrease in PepsiCo's stock  price
as well as an 8% increase in net debt.  PepsiCo has established a
long-term target range of 20-25% for its market net debt ratio to
optimize its cost of capital.

      As  measured on an historical cost basis, the ratio of  net
debt  to  net  capital  employed  (defined  as  net  debt,  other
liabilities, deferred income taxes and shareholders' equity)  was
49%  at year-end 1994 and 50% at year-end 1993.  The decline  was
due to a 9% increase in net capital employed, partially offset by
the increase in net debt.

      Because of PepsiCo's strong cash generating capability  and
its  strong financial condition, PepsiCo has continued access  to
capital markets throughout the world.

      At year-end 1994, about 60% of PepsiCo's net debt portfolio
was  exposed  to variable interest rates, up from  about  55%  in
1993.   In  addition  to variable rate debt, all  net  debt  with
maturities  of  less  than one year is categorized  as  variable.
PepsiCo  prefers funding its operations with variable  rate  debt
because it believes that, over the long-term, variable rate  debt
provides  more  cost effective financing than  fixed  rate  debt.
PepsiCo  will  issue  fixed  rate  debt  if  advantageous  market
opportunities  arise.   A 1 point change  in  interest  rates  on
variable rate net debt would impact annual interest expense,  net
of  interest  income, by approximately $38 million  ($21  million
after-tax or $0.03 per share) assuming the level and mix  of  the
December 31, 1994 net debt portfolio was maintained.

     PepsiCo's negative operating working capital position, which
principally  reflects  the cash sales nature  of  its  restaurant
operations,   effectively   provides   additional   capital   for
investment.  Operating working capital, which excludes short-term
investments  and  short-term  borrowings,  was  a  negative  $677
million and $849 million at year-end 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The  $172  million decline in negative working capital  primarily
reflected   reclassification  of  amounts  from   Other   current
liabilities to Other Liabilities and base business growth in  the
more working capital intensive bottling and snack food operations
exceeding the growth in restaurant operations.

     Shareholders' Equity increased $517 million or 8% from 1993.
This  change  reflected an 18% increase in retained earnings  due
to  $1.8  billion in net income less dividends declared  of  $555
million.   This growth was offset by a $448 million  increase  in
treasury  stock that reflected share repurchases, net  of  shares
used  for  stock option exercises and acquisitions,  and  a  $287
million   unfavorable   change  in   the   currency   translation
adjustment  account  



(CTA).  The CTA change  primarily  reflected the  impact of the 
devaluation of the Mexican peso in  late  1994 on the translation of our 
peso denominated net assets.

     Based  on  income  before cumulative  effect  of  accounting
changes, PepsiCo's return on average shareholders' equity  (ROAE)
was  27.0% in 1994 and 27.2% in 1993.  The ROAE was 26.5% in 1994
and  25.3%  in 1993, excluding from both income and shareholders'
equity  the  effect of the accounting changes and BAESA  gain  in
1994  as  well as the $29.9 million charge in 1993  due  to  1993
U.S. tax legislation.

Management's Analysis  -  Cash Flows

(See  Management's Analysis - Overview on page 7  for  background
information.)

      Cash flow activity in 1994 reflected strong cash flows from
operations of $3.7 billion and $421 million in net proceeds  from
short-term  investment activities.  These amounts  were  used  to
fund  capital  spending  of $2.3 billion, purchases  of  treasury
stock  totaling $549 million, dividend payments of $540  million,
acquisition  activity of $316 million and net debt repayments  of
$204 million.

     One of PepsiCo's most significant financial strengths is its
internal  cash  generation capability.  In  fact,  after  capital
spending   and  acquisitions,  each  industry  segment  generated
positive  cash  flows in 1994,  with particularly strong  results
from  beverages  and snack foods.  Net cash flows from  PepsiCo's
domestic  businesses were partially offset by international  uses
of   cash,   reflecting  strategies  to  accelerate   growth   of
international operations.

     The significant devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994
and  early 1995 did not materially impact 1994 consolidated  cash
flows.    However,   because  PepsiCo's  operations   in   Mexico
represented  approximately  7% of consolidated  cash  flows  from
operations  in 1994, the devaluation and its related effects  are
expected  to have an unfavorable impact on 1995 cash  flows  from
operations.   In  addition to the actions taken to  mitigate  the
unfavorable impact on operating profits, the operations in Mexico
will  defer  a  portion of their capital spending.   Nonetheless,
significant uncertainties remain in Mexico and, as a  result,  it
is  not  possible to quantify the impact on 1995 cash flows.   In
addition,  actions are being taken in other parts  of  the  world
intended  to  mitigate the impact.  See Management's  Analysis  -
Overview on page 7 for additional discussion.

      Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities in 1994 rose $582
million  or 19% over 1993, and in 1993 grew $423 million  or  16%
over 1992.  Income before noncash charges and credits rose 6%  in
1994  and  24%  in  1993.   The  increases  in  depreciation  and
amortization  noncash charges of $132 million in  1994  and  $229
million   in  1993  reflected  capital  spending  and  in   1993,
acquisitions.  The 1994 decrease of $150 million in the  deferred
income  tax provision was primarily due to the effect in 1994  of
converting  from  premium  based  casualty  insurance  to   self-
insurance  for  most  of these risks and adopting  SFAS  112  for
accounting  for  postemployment benefits.  The 1993  increase  of
$135  million in the deferred income tax provision was  primarily
due  to  the  lapping  of 1992 effects related  to  restructuring
accruals  and prefunded employee benefit expenses and the  impact
of  1993  U.S. tax legislation.  The cash provided in  1994  from
working  capital  was $357 million better than  1993,  reflecting
normal  increases  in  accrued  liabilities  across  all  of  our
businesses, lapping the effect of higher income tax payments  and
a   lower   provision  in  1993  and  improved  trade  receivable
collections,  partially offset by the impact on accounts  payable
of  the  timing  of a large year-end payment to prefund  employee
benefits.   The  1993 over 1992 net increase of $257  million  in
cash   used  for  operating  working  capital  reflected   slower
collections  of  domestic accounts receivable,  advance  domestic
purchases  of product ingredients, the higher payments of  income
taxes  and  the  lapping  of 1992 and  1991  effects  related  to
restructuring  accruals,  partially  offset  by  the  payment  to
prefund employee benefits.

      Investing  Activities over the past three  years  reflected
strategic spending in all three industry segments through capital
spending,  acquisitions and investments in  affiliates.   PepsiCo
seeks  investments that generate cash returns in  excess  of  its
long-term cost of capital, which is estimated to be approximately
11% at year-end 1994.  See Note 5 for a discussion of acquisition
activity.   About 75% of the total acquisition activity  in  1994
represented international transactions, compared to 45%  in  1993
and  60%  in  1992.   PepsiCo continues to seek opportunities  to
strengthen   its  position  in  its  domestic  and  international
industry segments through such strategic acquisitions.



      Increased capital spending in 1994 was driven by  beverages
reflecting  investments in equipment for new  packaging  and  new
products   in  the  U.S.  and  emerging  international   markets,
primarily Eastern Europe.  Capital spending increases in 1993 and
1992  were  driven  by  restaurants,  primarily  for  new  units.
Restaurants represented about half of the total capital  spending
in  all  three  years.  Restaurants, beverages  and  snack  foods
represent  40%, 30% and 30%, respectively, of the estimated  $2.4
billion  spending in 1995.  This reflects a shift primarily  from
restaurants  to  snack  foods.  Beverages and  snack  foods  1995
capital  spending  reflects  production  capacity  expansion  and
equipment  replacements, while restaurants is primarily  for  new
units.   Restaurant  capital spending  in  1995  may  be  further
reduced depending upon future decisions as described beginning on
page  23.   Approximately one-third of the planned  1995  capital
spending relates to international businesses, about the  same  as
the  prior three years.  Cash provided by operations is  expected
to be sufficient to fund the expected capital spending.

      Investment  activity  in PepsiCo's  short-term  portfolios,
primarily  held outside the U.S., provided $421 million  in  1994
and $259 million in 1993, respectively, compared to the increased
net investment of $52 million in 1992.

      Financing Activities.   The 1994 over 1993 change  in  cash
flows  from  net financing activities was a use of $937  million,
primarily  reflecting net repayments of short and long-term  debt
of $204 million compared to net proceeds of $590 million in 1993.
The 1993 over 1992 change in cash flows from financing activities
was  a  use of $328 million, primarily due to increased purchases
of treasury stock.

      At  year-end  1994,  PepsiCo had authority  to  issue  $3.4
billion  of  long-term debt and had facilities in  place  in  the
U.S.,   Europe  and  Japan  to  take  advantage  of   marketplace
opportunities.    The   principal   purposes   of   these   shelf
registrations are for financing growth activities and refinancing
borrowings.

      Cash dividends declared were $555 million in 1994 and  $486
million in 1993.  PepsiCo targets a dividend payout of about one-
third  of  the prior year's income from ongoing operations,  thus
retaining sufficient earnings to provide financial resources  for
growth opportunities.

       Share   repurchase  decisions  are  evaluated  considering
management's  target  capital  structure  and  other   investment
opportunities.  In 1994, PepsiCo repurchased 15.0 million  shares
at  a  cost  of  $549  million.  Subsequent to year-end,  PepsiCo
repurchased 3.4 million shares through February 7, 1995 at a cost
of  $121  million.   Including these  repurchases,  18.8  million
shares   have  been  repurchased  under  the  50  million   share
repurchase  authority granted by PepsiCo's Board of Directors  on
July 22, 1993.

Management's Analysis

See  Management's  Analysis - Overview on page 7  for  background
information  and discussion of the fifty-third week in  1994  and
Business  Segments on page F-9 for detailed results.   Net  sales
and  operating profits within this discussion include the  impact
of  the  fifty-third week.  System bottler case  sales  of  Pepsi
Corporate  brands (case sales) were not impacted  by  the  fifty-
third week because they are measured on a calendar year basis.
                                
     1994 vs. 1993

      Worldwide net sales increased $1.0 billion or 12%  to  $9.7
billion.  The fifty-third week contributed approximately 1  point
to  the  sales growth with domestic and international  operations
benefiting   by   about  2  points  and  1  point,  respectively.
Comparisons are affected by acquisitions, consisting primarily of
franchised bottling operations in the U.S. and Asia, as  well  as
the  absence  of  certain  small  bottling  operations  sold   or
contributed to joint ventures (collectively, "net acquisitions").
Net  acquisitions, principally domestic, contributed $161 million
or 2 points to worldwide sales growth.



      Domestic  sales rose $623 million or 11% to  $6.5  billion.
Net  acquisitions contributed $158 million or 3 points  to  sales
growth.   Volume  growth  contributed  $510  million,  driven  by
carbonated  soft  drink (CSD) packaged products.   This  benefit,
combined  with  a  mix  shift  to the  higher-priced  alternative
beverage  packaged products and higher concentrate  and  fountain
syrup  pricing,  was  partially offset by lower  net  pricing  to
retailers and a mix shift to The Cube, our value-priced  24-pack.
The  lower  net  pricing reflected increased price discounts  and
promotional  allowances  for CSD in  response  to  private  label
competition  and  Lipton brand tea.  See Note  1  for  discussion
concerning   classification  of  promotional  price   allowances.
Domestic  alternative beverages comprise primarily  Lipton  brand
tea,  All Sport and Ocean Spray Lemonade products.  CSD comprises
the balance of the Pepsi Corporate beverage portfolio.

      Case sales volume consists of sales of packaged products to
retailers  and  through vending machines and  fountain  syrup  by
company-owned and franchised bottlers.  Previously existing Ocean
Spray  products sold to retailers under a distribution  agreement
are  not  included in reported case sales growth.  Domestic  case
sales increased 6%, reflecting strong double-digit growth in  the
Mountain  Dew brand and solid gains in Brand Pepsi.   Case  sales
growth  also  benefited by strong double-digit growth  in  Lipton
brand  tea  and  gains in the Diet Pepsi brand.  These  advances,
combined  with the national distribution of All Sport  and  Ocean
Spray  Lemonade  in  1994  and gains in the  Slice  brands,  were
partially  offset  by significant declines in the  Crystal  Pepsi
brands.   Alternative beverages contributed 2 points to the  case
sales growth.  Case sales of fountain syrup grew at a slower rate
than packaged products.

      International  sales  rose $426  million  or  16%  to  $3.2
billion.   This  growth reflected higher volume of $300  million,
the   start-up   of   company-owned  bottling  and   distribution
operations, principally in Eastern Europe, and the first year  of
sales  of  Stolichnaya  vodka under the 1994  appointment  of  an
affiliate  of  Grand  Metropolitan  as  the  exclusive  U.S.  and
Canadian  distributor.  Higher concentrate pricing was offset  by
an  unfavorable currency translation impact and lower net pricing
on  packaged  products.   The  unfavorable  currency  translation
impact  reflected  a weaker Canadian dollar, Spanish  peseta  and
Mexican peso, partially offset by a stronger Japanese yen.

      International  case sales increased 9%,  reflecting  strong
double-digit  growth in Asia, led by China and India,  and  solid
advances  in Latin America, as growth in Mexico more than  offset
declines  in  Venezuela.  Latin America and Mexico represent our
largest    international   case   sales   region   and   country,
respectively.   Double-digit advances in Eastern Europe  and  the
Middle  East, combined with single-digit growth in Western Europe
and  Canada, were partially offset by declines in Africa.   Pepsi
Max, a new low-calorie cola, aided case sales growth.

     Worldwide operating profits increased $108 million or 10% to
$1.2  billion.   The fifty-third week enhanced profit  growth  by
approximately 2 points with domestic and international operations
benefiting by about 1 point and 2 points, respectively.

      Domestic  profits  increased $85  million  or  9%  to  $1.0
billion.   Volume gains, driven by packaged products, contributed
$305  million to profit growth.  This benefit, combined with  the
higher  concentrate  and  fountain syrup pricing,  was  partially
offset  by  higher operating expenses, the lower net  pricing  to
retailers, the mix shift to The Cube and increased product costs.
Selling  and  distribution expenses grew at a  faster  rate  than
sales,  driven by higher volume-driven labor costs.   Advertising
and   marketing  costs  grew  at  a  slower  rate   than   sales.
Administrative expenses declined modestly reflecting savings from
a  1994 consolidation of headquarters and field operations and  a
reduction  in  the scope of the 1992 restructuring actions,  both
discussed  below.  These benefits were largely offset  by  normal
increases  in  administrative expenses.   The  increased  product
costs  reflected  the  mix shift to the higher  cost  alternative
beverages and higher ingredient costs, partially offset by  lower
packaging  costs.  Alternative beverages, driven by Lipton  brand
tea,  aided  the  profit  growth.   The  domestic  profit  margin
declined slightly to 15.6%.

      In  the  third  quarter of 1994, Pepsi-Cola  reversed  into
income  $24.2 million of the $115.4 million restructuring accrual
established  in  1992  and,  in the third  and  fourth  quarters,
recorded  additional  charges totaling $22.3  million,  primarily
reflecting   management's   decision   to   further   consolidate
headquarters  and  field  operations.   The  1994  charges  cover
severance   costs  associated  with  employee  terminations   and
relocation costs for employees 



who, in 1994, have accepted offers to  relocate.  See 1993 vs. 1992 
discussion for a description  of the 1992 restructuring charge.

      The $24.2 million reversal reflects both refinements of the
estimates  originally used to establish the accrual,  principally
for  costs  associated with displaced employees, and management's
decision   to  reduce  the  scope  of  the  restructuring.    The
nationwide   implementation   of  several   of   the   anticipated
administrative and business process redesigns has been completed,
with  the balance of the redesigns projected to be completed over
the next three years.

      The  benefits  of the restructuring activities  when  fully
implemented  were  originally projected to be approximately  $105
million  annually, based on reduced employee and facility  costs.
The  current projection of annual benefits from these sources has
decreased  to approximately $40 million reflecting, in part,  the
reduced  scope of the restructuring.  While difficult to measure,
in  1994 Pepsi-Cola estimated other sources of benefits from  the
restructuring  of  approximately $90 million annually,  based  on
centralization  of  purchasing activities and incremental  volume
and  pricing  from  improvements in administrative  and  business
processes.   These  additional  sources  of  benefits,   although
identified  when the 1992 restructuring accrual was  established,
were  not  included  in  the projected  annual  benefits  due  to
significant  uncertainties and difficulties  in  quantifying  the
amounts, if any, of such benefits.  Due to delays in implementing
some  of  the  restructuring actions,  full  realization  of  the
expected  benefits also has been delayed.  Benefits in 1994  were
offset   by  incremental  costs  associated  with  the  continued
development  and  implementation of  the  restructuring  actions.
This offset is expected to continue into 1995.  Net benefits  are
expected  to  begin in 1996 and to increase annually until  fully
realized  in  1998.  All benefits derived from the  restructuring
actions  will  be  reinvested in the business to  strengthen  our
competitive position.

      International profits increased $23 million or 13% to  $195
million.   Net  acquisitions reduced profits by $9 million  or  5
points.   The  increased profits reflected volume growth  of  $75
million,  led  by concentrate shipments.  This benefit,  combined
with  a  decline  in  advertising  and  marketing  expenses   not
attributed  to volume growth, was partially offset  by  increased
field  and headquarters administrative expenses, start-up losses,
principally  in  Eastern  Europe,  and  an  unfavorable  currency
translation  impact,  primarily from the  Mexican  peso  and  the
Canadian dollar.  The increased administrative expenses reflected
costs  to  support expansion in developing markets.   The  higher
concentrate pricing was partially offset by a decline in finished
product  sales to franchised bottlers, principally in Japan,  and
the  lower  net pricing on packaged products.  Increased  profits
from  the  first  year of sales of Stolichnaya,  under  the  1994
appointment  of  an  affiliate  of  Grand  Metropolitan  as   the
exclusive  U.S.  and Canadian distributor, aided  profit  growth.
The  new  Pepsi Max product significantly contributed  to  profit
growth.   Profits increased in Latin America, led by Mexico,  and
in  Western  Europe, reflecting significantly reduced  losses  in
Germany.   Profits  also  grew in Asia,  reflecting  advances  in
Japan.   The profit growth was restrained by start-up  losses  in
Eastern  Europe and declines in Canada, reflecting private  label
competition.  The international profit margin remained relatively
unchanged at 6.2%.

      The  1992 restructuring actions to streamline the  acquired
Spanish   franchised   bottling  operation   were   substantially
completed in 1994.  These actions have resulted in total  savings
approximating  $15  million in 1994, with  total  annual  savings
expected  to  grow to about $20 million in 1995, consistent  with
our  original  projection.  These savings  will  continue  to  be
reinvested  in  our  businesses  to  strengthen  our  competitive
position.

     The significant devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994
and  early  1995  did  not materially impact  1994  international
beverage operating profits.  However, because Mexico, our largest
profit  country,  represented approximately 22% of  international
beverage  operating  profits in 1994,  the  devaluation  and  its
related  effects  are expected to have an unfavorable  impact  on
1995  operating profits.  The operations in Mexico have begun  to
take  actions to increase volume, enhance net pricing and  reduce
costs,   including  evaluating  alternative   sourcing   of   raw
materials.   Nonetheless,  significant  uncertainties  remain  in
Mexico  and,  as  a result, it is not possible  to  quantify  the
impact.   International beverages has also begun to take  actions
in several other countries in 1995 to help mitigate the impact.




     1993 vs. 1992

      Worldwide net sales increased $1.0 billion or 14%  to  $8.6
billion.    Comparisons   are  affected  by   net   acquisitions,
consisting  primarily  of  acquisitions  of  franchised  bottling
operations  in  Spain and the U.S., as well  as  the  absence  of
results  of certain small international bottling and distribution
operations   sold  or  contributed  to  a  joint  venture.    Net
acquisitions  contributed $697 million or 10 points to  worldwide
sales growth.

      Domestic  sales  grew $433 million or 8% to  $5.9  billion.
Acquisitions  contributed $222 million or 4  points  of  domestic
sales growth.  Volume growth, driven by new products, contributed
approximately  $170  million.  The balance of  the  sales  growth
reflected  a  mix shift to new products with higher  net  prices,
principally  the  new  Lipton Original brand  ready-to-drink  tea
products and certain Ocean Spray brand juice products.

      Domestic case sales increased 3%, reflecting the impact  of
the  late  1992  introduction of Crystal Pepsi and  Diet  Crystal
Pepsi  brands, the growth in Mountain Dew brands and the expanded
distribution  of new Lipton brand tea products.   Case  sales  of
fountain  syrup  grew  at  the same rate  as  packaged  products.
Excluding the Lipton products, case sales volume grew 2%,  driven
by  a  double-digit increase in Mountain Dew.  Case sales of  the
Crystal  Pepsi brands offset a decline in brands Pepsi  and  Diet
Pepsi.

      International  sales  rose $600  million  or  28%  to  $2.7
billion.  Net acquisitions contributed $476 million or 22  points
of  sales  growth.   The  balance of the sales  growth  reflected
higher  concentrate pricing, led by Latin America as well as  the
start-up  of company-owned distribution operations in France  and
Eastern  Europe.   Sales growth was depressed by the  unfavorable
currency  translation impact of a stronger U.S.  dollar  in  both
concentrate and bottling operations.  A small decline in existing
bottling  operations reflected lower pricing in Germany,  largely
offset by higher prices and volumes in Greece.

      International  case  sales rose 7%.   Excluding  the  newly
acquired  KAS  flavor brands in Spain, international  case  sales
grew  5%.   This  performance reflected solid advances  in  Latin
America as well as double-digit growth in Asia, led by China  and
Pakistan, and in Eastern Europe, led by Turkey and Hungary.   The
Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, also contributed to  case
sales growth.

     Worldwide operating profits increased $310 million or 39% to
$1.1  billion.  Excluding the 1992 restructuring charges totaling
$145  million ($115.4 million for domestic and $29.6 million  for
international), profits were up 18%.

      The  1992  domestic  charge arose  from  an  organizational
restructuring  designed to improve customer focus  by  realigning
resources  consistent with Pepsi-Cola's "Right Side Up" operating
philosophy,  as  well  as  a redesign of key  administrative  and
business   processes.   The  organizational   restructuring   was
completed  in 1992.  The redesign of core processes  is  ongoing.
The   charge  included  provisions  for  costs  associated   with
redeployed  and  displaced  employees,  the  redesign   of   core
processes and office closures.

       The  international  restructuring  charge,  which  related
primarily  to  displaced  employees, included  $18.5  million  to
streamline  the  acquired Spanish franchised bottling  operation.
This  amount represented 30% (PepsiCo's ownership interest  prior
to  the acquisition of the remaining interest) of the total  cost
of  the  streamlining.  The remaining $11.1 million of the charge
represented  costs  associated with  streamlining  the  worldwide
field  management organization which was substantially  completed
in 1993.

      The  costs provided for in these domestic and international
restructuring actions and the related savings are principally  of
a  cash  nature.   The  benefits of the  completed  international
worldwide  actions resulted in annual savings of $7  million,  as
originally projected.  The savings will continue to be reinvested
in the business to strengthen our competitive position.

      Domestic  profits increased $250 million  or  37%  to  $937
million.   Excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, profits  grew
$135  million  or  17%.   Volume  gains,  led  by  new  products,
contributed  about $90 million to profits. 



The combined  benefit of lower packaging and ingredient costs and the 
favorable product mix  shift  was  largely  offset by  higher  operating  
expenses. Profit growth also benefited from a $12 million reduction in
retiree health care expense due to 1993 plan amendments described
in  Note  12, as well as a $9 million credit arising from  a  net
adjustment  of  accruals  related to prior  years'  acquisitions.
Promotional  costs  were  about even  with  last  year;  however,
selling  and administrative expenses grew at a faster  rate  than
sales due to transitional costs to support the organizational and
process redesign initiatives discussed above.  This higher  level
of  selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales  is
expected to continue until the benefits of these initiatives  are
realized.   Sales of the new higher-margin Lipton Original  brand
tea  products  resulted in a significant contribution  to  profit
growth.   The  Crystal  Pepsi products particularly  aided  first
quarter  results,  but  did not significantly  impact  full  year
profits.    The  domestic  profit  margin,  excluding  the   1992
restructuring charge, grew over 1 point to 15.8%.

      International profits increased $60 million or 53% to  $172
million.   Excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, profits  grew
$30  million  or  21%. The profit advance, led by Latin  America,
reflected  higher  concentrate pricing  in  excess  of  increased
operating   expenses,  and  concentrate  shipment   growth   that
contributed  about  $15 million.  These benefits  were  partially
offset   by  increased  losses  in  company-owned  bottling   and
distribution   operations,   led  by   Germany.    Start-ups   of
distribution operations also contributed to the increased losses.
Unfavorable   currency   translation  impacts,   principally   in
concentrate  operations, also negatively affected profit  growth.
A  profit  decline  in  bottling  operations  in  Japan,  due  to
increased  operating expenses, was offset by  growth  in  Canada,
reflecting  administrative cost reductions through  consolidation
of  support  functions  in  recently  acquired  operations.   The
Canadian improvement was achieved despite a $12.2 million  fourth
quarter   1993  charge  to  further  streamline  operations   and
strengthen its competitive position.  Offsetting this effect  was
an  $11.9 million credit in the second quarter of 1993 related to
a  settlement of litigation with a former franchised  bottler  in
Europe.  The  international  profit margin,  excluding  the  1992
restructuring  charge, declined almost one-half  point  to  6.3%.
Excluding  the  impact of the lower margin net acquisitions,  the
profit margin grew 1 point.

Management's Analysis

See  Management's  Analysis - Overview on page 7  for  background
information  and discussion of the fifty-third week in  1994  and
Business  Segments on page F-9 for detailed results.   Net  sales
and  operating profits within this discussion include the  impact
of  the  fifty-third week while pound and kilo growth  have  been
adjusted to exclude its impact.

     1994 vs. 1993

      Worldwide  net  sales  rose $1.2 billion  or  18%  to  $8.3
billion.  The fifty-third week contributed approximately 2 points
to  the  sales growth with domestic and international  operations
benefiting by about 2 points and 1 point, respectively.

      Domestic  sales grew $646 million or 15% to  $5.0  billion,
reflecting volume growth of $660 million.  Volume gains reflected
growth  in  most  major  brands and line extensions  of  existing
products.    Sales   growth  was  further  aided   by   increased
promotional price allowances and marketing programs to retailers,
which  are  reported as marketing expenses and therefore  do  not
reduce  reported  sales.   See  Note  1  for  further  discussion
concerning  classification  of  promotional  allowances.   Higher
gross  pricing was offset by a sales mix shift to larger,  value-
oriented packages and products with lower gross prices.

      Total domestic pound volume advanced 13%.  This performance
was  led  by  strong  double-digit growth in Lay's  brand  potato
chips,  reflecting the successful promotion of Wavy  Lay's  brand
potato  chips and growth of Lay's KC Masterpiece Barbecue  Flavor
brand  potato chips, Rold Gold and Rold Gold Fat Free Thins brand
pretzels  and Tostitos brand tortilla chips, driven by Restaurant
Style  Tostitos  brand  and the expanded  distribution  of  Baked
Tostitos  brand.  Doritos brand tortilla chips had solid  single-
digit  volume  growth while Fritos brand corn chips and  



Chee.tos brand  cheese flavored snacks reflected low double-digit  
growth. Ruffles brand potato chips showed modest growth.

      International  sales  rose $592  million  or  22%  to  $3.3
billion.   Confectioneries (primarily candy and cookies)  account
for   approximately  30%  of  international  snack  food   sales.
Acquisitions contributed $67 million or 2 points to sales growth.
The  balance  of  the sales growth was driven by higher  volumes,
which  contributed $590 million, led by successful promotions  by
the  Sabritas  snack  chip  and  candy  business  in  Mexico.   A
favorable brand mix shift to higher-priced products, primarily in
Latin  America  and  the U.K., and higher  pricing  were  largely
offset  by  the  unfavorable currency  translation  impact  of  a
stronger U.S. dollar, principally against the Mexican peso.

     International kilo growth is reported on a systemwide basis,
which  includes  both consolidated businesses and joint  ventures
operating  for  at least one year.  Systemwide snack  chip  kilos
rose 16%, led by strong double-digit growth at Sabritas, in Spain
and  Brazil and solid gains in the U.K.  Systemwide confectionary
kilos  also grew 16%, reflecting double-digit advances at  Gamesa
and Sabritas and gains in Egypt and Poland.

     Worldwide operating profits increased $187 million or 16% to
$1.4   billion.   The  fifty-third  week  enhanced   profits   by
approximately 2 points with domestic and international operations
benefiting by about 3 points and 1 point, respectively.

      Domestic profits grew $124 million or 14% to $1.0  billion.
This   performance   reflected  strong   volume   growth,   which
contributed  $340 million.  This growth was partially  offset  by
the impact of increased operating and manufacturing costs and  an
unfavorable   sales  mix  shift  to  lower-margin  packages   and
products.   Increased  operating  costs  were  driven  by  higher
selling,  distribution  and  new  system  costs  in  addition  to
increased  investment  in  marketing  costs  to  maintain  strong
momentum in 1995.  Increased capacity costs were partially offset
by  manufacturing efficiencies.  Higher vegetable oil costs  were
substantially  offset  by  lower  packaging  and  potato   costs.
Increased promotional price allowances and merchandising  support
largely  offset higher pricing on certain brands.   The  domestic
profit margin remained relatively unchanged at 20.5%.

      Though difficult to forecast, there are no material changes
expected  in potato costs for 1995.  However, potato prices  have
been  less predictable in recent years due to weather conditions.
Vegetable  oil prices are expected to decline slightly  from  the
high  1994  levels  while the cost of packaging  is  expected  to
increase.

      International profits increased $63 million or 22% to  $352
million.  Higher volumes contributed $95 million to international
profit  growth,  led  by Sabritas.  The combined  impact  of  the
favorable product and package mix shifts, primarily in  the  U.K.
and  Latin  America, and modestly higher pricing were  more  than
offset   by  higher  direct  and  administrative  costs  and   an
unfavorable  currency translation impact from the  Mexican  peso.
Higher   direct   costs   resulted  primarily   from   investment
initiatives  to  build  brand  equity  and  enhance  distribution
channels  in  Mexico.   Profit growth was also  dampened  by  the
lapping  of last year's noncash credit of $6.1 million  resulting
from  the decision to retain a small snack chip business in Japan
previously  held  for  sale.   The  international  profit  margin
remained relatively unchanged at 10.8%.

      The  international  restructuring charge  in  1992  related
primarily  to actions to consolidate and streamline  the  Walkers
business  in  the  U.K. that were substantially completed  during
1994.  These actions are estimated to result in annual savings of
about  $32  million,  which continue  to  be  reinvested  in  the
business  to strengthen our competitive position.  See  1993  vs.
1992   discussion  for  a  further  explanation   of   the   1992
restructuring charge.

      Strong double-digit profit growth at Sabritas was driven by
higher snack chip and candy volumes.  This benefit, combined with
a  favorable product mix shift to higher-margin snacks and  lower
manufacturing overhead and administrative costs, more than offset
increased  potato  costs,  higher  promotional  spending  and  an
unfavorable currency translation impact.

      Walkers  profits  advanced at a strong  double-digit  rate,
driven  by  a  favorable product mix shift, reflecting  increased
sales  of  higher-margin branded products and the elimination  of
most  lower-margin  private  label products,  



increased  volumes, lower  raw  material and packaging costs and lower  
manufacturing expenses  resulting from the 1992 restructuring  actions.   
These benefits  offset start-up costs related to the launch of  Doritos
brand   tortilla   chips  which  exceeded   incremental   profits
generated.

      Gamesa  posted  strong profit growth on a relatively  small
base,  reflecting a favorable package mix shift to  higher-margin
single  serve  products  and  lower  manufacturing  overhead  and
administrative  costs resulting from cost reduction  initiatives.
These  benefits  were partially offset by higher  product  costs,
selling and distribution costs associated with the expansion of a
direct  delivery  system and an unfavorable currency  translation
impact.

     The significant devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994
and early 1995 did not materially impact 1994 international snack
food  operating  profits.  However, because Sabritas  and  Gamesa
combined  represented  approximately 63% of  international  snack
food  operating profits in 1994, the devaluation and its  related
effects  are  expected  to  have an unfavorable  impact  on  1995
operating  profits.  Sabritas and Gamesa have begun  to  increase
pricing   and  reduce  costs,  including  evaluating  alternative
sourcing    of    raw   materials.    Nonetheless,    significant
uncertainties  remain  in Mexico and, as  a  result,  it  is  not
possible  to quantify the impact.  International snack foods  has
also  begun to take actions in several of its other countries  in
1995 to help mitigate the impact.

     1993 vs. 1992

      Worldwide  net  sales  rose $895 million  or  15%  to  $7.0
billion.  Comparisons are affected by international acquisitions,
consisting principally of the securing of a controlling  interest
in  the  Gamesa  (Mexico) cookie business and the buyout  of  the
joint  venture  partner at Hostess Frito-Lay  (Canada),  both  in
1992,  as well as the 1993 reconsolidation of a small snack  chip
business   in  Japan  previously  held  for  sale  (collectively,
"acquisition activity").  Acquisition activity added $383 million
or 7 points to the worldwide sales growth.

      Domestic  sales grew $415 million or 11% to  $4.4  billion.
Volume  growth contributed $320 million to the domestic increase.
Sales  growth  also  reflected higher effective  pricing  through
lower  package weights, partially offset by a sales mix shift  to
larger,  value-oriented packages and products  with  lower  gross
prices.   The higher effective pricing was mitigated by increased
promotional price allowances to retailers, which are reported  as
marketing expenses and therefore do not reduce reported sales.

      Total  domestic pound sales advanced 8%, reflecting double-
digit  growth  in Lay's brand potato chips, Doritos and  Tostitos
brand tortilla chips and Rold Gold brand pretzels.

      International  sales  rose $480  million  or  22%  to  $2.6
billion.   Acquisition activity contributed $383  million  or  18
points to the increase.  The balance of the sales growth, led  by
the  Sabritas snack chip and candy business in Mexico,  reflected
higher  volumes,  which  contributed  $150  million,  and  higher
pricing.   This  growth was partially offset by  the  unfavorable
currency   translation   impact  of  a  stronger   U.S.   dollar,
principally against the British pound.

      International systemwide snack chip volume rose  5%,led  by
double-digit  growth in Canada and Turkey and gains  at  Sabritas
and  in  the U.K.  Confectioneries (primarily candy and  cookies)
account for about 30% of reported international snack food sales.
Systemwide  confectionery  volume grew  7%  reflecting  gains  at
Gamesa and double-digit advances at Sabritas.

     Worldwide operating profits increased $205 million or 21% to
$1.2  billion.   Excluding  a  1992  international  restructuring
charge of $40.3 million, profits increased 16%.

      The  largest  component  of the 1992  restructuring  charge
related  to  actions, many of which were completed  in  1993,  to
consolidate and streamline the Walkers business in the U.K.   The
costs  provided  for in these restructuring actions  and  related
savings   are  principally  of  a  cash  nature.   As  originally
projected,  these actions, when fully implemented, are  currently
expected  to  result  in  annual savings of  about  $35  million,
providing  additional resources for reinvestment in the  business
to strengthen our competitive position.



      Domestic profits rose $125 million or 16% to $901  million.
This  performance reflected volume growth, which contributed $165
million  to  domestic  profits, and a $24  million  reduction  in
retiree health care expense due to 1993 plan amendments described
in  Note  12.  These benefits were partially offset by  increased
manufacturing  costs and other operating expenses  that  exceeded
the  higher effective pricing.  The unfavorable sales  mix  shift
also  depressed  profit growth.  The higher  manufacturing  costs
reflected  a  temporary increase in potato costs of approximately
$25  million  resulting  from  the  effects  of  extreme  weather
conditions in March on the potato crop in the Southern U.S.   The
domestic profit margin rose 1 point to 20.6%.

      Though  difficult to forecast, higher prices  in  1994  for
vegetable oil, resulting from the past summer's flooding  in  the
Midwestern  U.S.,  were  expected to be  partially  offset  by  a
decline in potato prices from 1993 levels.

      International  profits  grew $80 million  or  38%  to  $289
million.   Excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, profits  rose
$39  million  or  16%.   The  profit performance  was  driven  by
Sabritas  and  reflected higher volumes,  which  contributed  $85
million  to  profit growth, and a $6.1 million  credit  resulting
from  the decision to retain the business in Japan.  This  growth
was  partially offset by operating cost increases, net of savings
from  the  restructuring actions announced in 1992, that exceeded
higher  pricing,  and  unfavorable currency translation  impacts.
The international profit margin, excluding the 1992 restructuring
charge,  declined one-half point to 10.9%.  Excluding the  impact
of lower margin acquisitions, the profit margin increased over  1
point.

      Double-digit profit growth at Sabritas was driven by higher
snack  chip and candy volumes.  Increased manufacturing and other
operating expenses were partially offset by higher pricing.

      Profits in the U.K. declined due to an unfavorable currency
translation  impact.   Double-digit  profit  growth  on  a  local
currency   basis  reflected  the  cost  savings  from  the   1992
restructuring  actions, volume gains and a  sales  mix  shift  to
higher   margin   products,   partially   offset   by   increased
manufacturing  costs.  Profit growth was also  depressed  by  the
effect  of  a  1992 credit arising from the final  settlement  of
pension  assets  related  to the 1989  acquisition  of  the  U.K.
operations.  A decline in profits for Poland reflected  increased
manufacturing costs and lower pricing.

      Gamesa  and Hostess Frito-Lay, both acquired midyear  1992,
posted  volume-driven  profit growth for  the  comparable  period
since  acquisition;  i.e., the second  half  of  1993  vs.  1992.
Acquisition  activity, which includes only the  results  for  the
first  half  of 1993 for Gamesa and Hostess Frito-Lay,  did  not,
however, significantly affect the full year international  profit
comparison,  as  losses at Gamesa offset profits  contributed  by
Hostess Frito-Lay and other smaller acquisitions.  Gamesa  posted
a profit for the full year despite the first half loss.

Management's Analysis

See  Management's  Analysis - Overview on page 7  for  background
information  and discussion of the fifty-third week in  1994  and
Business  Segments on page F-9 for detailed results.   Net  sales
and  operating profits within this discussion include the  impact
of  the  fifty-third week while same store sales growth has  been
adjusted  to  exclude  its impact.  Also, for  purposes  of  this
analysis,  the net sales and operating profits of the  franchisee
operations  of PFS, PepsiCo's restaurant distribution  operation,
have been allocated to each restaurant chain.
                                
     1994 vs. 1993

      Worldwide net sales increased $1.2 billion or 12% to  $10.5
billion.  The fifty-third week contributed approximately 1  point
to  the  sales growth with domestic and international  operations
benefiting  by  about  1 point and 2 points,  respectively.   The
sales  growth  was primarily due to $934 million from  additional
units   (units   constructed  and  acquired,   principally   from
franchisees, net of units closed and sold) and volume  growth  of
$185  million.  Domestic sales increased $668 million  or  8%  to
$8.7 billion and international sales rose $497 million or 37%  to
$1.8 billion.



      Worldwide operating profits declined $48 million or  6%  to
$730  million.  The fifty-third week mitigated the profit decline
by   approximately  3  points  with  domestic  and  international
operations  benefiting at the same rate.  The  decline  reflected
increased  administrative and support costs,  including  spending
for  strategic  initiatives  and  aggressive  international  unit
development, higher store operating costs and a sales  mix  shift
to   lower-margin  products.   These  were  partially  offset  by
additional units that contributed $73 million, lower raw material
costs  and  higher franchise royalty revenues.  Volume growth  of
$30  million  was  offset by lower net prices.  Domestic  profits
declined  $26  million  or  4%  to $659  million.   International
profits fell $22 million or 23% to $71 million, which included  a
$7  million charge to consolidate the headquarters operations for
the three international restaurant businesses into one.

     The significant devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994
and  early  1995  did  not materially impact  1994  international
restaurant operating profits.  Results from Mexico constitute  an
immaterial portion of international restaurant profits.  However,
the  devaluation and its related effects are expected to have  an
unfavorable  impact  on 1995 results.  The operations  in  Mexico
have  begun  to  increase  pricing and  reduce  costs,  including
evaluating  alternative sourcing of raw materials.  In  addition,
further  expansion  of company-owned units has  been  temporarily
halted   pending  stabilization  of  the  economy.   Nonetheless,
significant uncertainties remain in Mexico and, as a  result,  it
is not possible to quantify the impact.

      Late  in  1994,  Roger Enrico was named  Chairman,  PepsiCo
Worldwide  Restaurants.   He  is  currently  evaluating   several
options to improve their operating results and  returns  on  our
total   restaurant  investments.   Examples  of   options   under
consideration  to  improve investment returns include  a  reduced
company  share of future new restaurant development and  sale  of
some  existing  company  restaurants to  franchisees.   The  cash
generated  from these options would most likely be reinvested  in
our nonrestaurant businesses or used to repurchase PepsiCo stock.
We  expect  to  begin  making decisions on  these  and  other
options  during  1995  as we continue to refine our restaurant 
operating strategies.

Pizza Hut

     Worldwide sales increased $346 million or 8% to $4.5 billion
driven   by  international  operations.   However,  the  domestic
operations  continue to represent the major portion of  worldwide
Pizza Hut.  The worldwide sales increase was driven by additional
units  that contributed $460 million, including $80 million  from
the domestic acquisition of D'Angelo Sandwich Shops late in 1993.
This  benefit  was  partially offset  by  lower  volumes  of  $60
million,   reflecting  domestic  volume  declines  that  exceeded
international volume gains, and lower net pricing.  The  domestic
volume   declines  primarily  reflected  lapping  the  successful
national roll-out of Bigfoot Pizza in 1993.

      Same  store sales for domestic company-owned units declined
6%,  though  volume  decreased at a slightly  slower  rate.   The
decline  was  primarily  in the delivery and  carryout  channels,
reflecting the lapping of the national roll-out of Bigfoot  Pizza
in 1993.

      Worldwide  profits decreased $77 million  or  21%  to  $295
million.   This  decline reflected the lower net pricing  due  to
value-oriented promotions, increased administrative  and  support
spending,  primarily  to  develop  international  markets,  lower
volumes  of $35 million, reflecting the domestic volume  declines
partially offset by the international volume advances, and higher
store operating costs.  These were partially offset by additional
units  that contributed $27 million, increased franchise  royalty
revenues  and  favorable  food costs, as slightly  higher  cheese
prices  were  more than offset by favorable meat  costs.   Though
difficult to forecast, these food costs are expected to  decrease
in  1995.   The profit decline was also mitigated by a  favorable
impact of $14 million from extending depreciable lives on certain
domestic  delivery assets and the absence of last year's start-up
costs associated with Bigfoot Pizza.  The worldwide profit margin
declined more than 2 points to 6.6%.

     International sales posted strong double-digit growth driven
by  additional  units,  particularly in  Korea,  Brazil,  Canada,
Mexico  and Spain.  Volume gains were partially offset  by  lower
net  pricing.  International profits declined sharply, reflecting
increased start-up and administrative costs to support aggressive
development strategies, 



partially offset by additional units  and increased franchise royalty 
revenues.  International profits also reflected  Pizza  Hut's  share of 
the international  restaurants'consolidation charge.

      Strong gains in Korea, the largest profit market, primarily
reflected  additional  units and strong volume  growth.   Profits
declined  in  the  largest sales markets, Australia  and  Canada.
Additionally, significant start-up losses were experienced in the
new Poland operations.

      Worldwide  sales  increased $500 million  or  17%  to  $3.4
billion.  The domestic operations represent substantially all  of
worldwide  Taco  Bell.  The worldwide sales  growth  was  led  by
additional  Taco  Bell units which contributed $281  million  and
volume  gains that provided $125 million, half of which  was  the
result  of  food and paper sales to additional franchisees.   The
sales growth also reflected $84 million due to the acquisition of
Chevys  in the third quarter of 1993 and new Chevys units.   Same
store  sales for domestic company-owned Taco Bell units grew  2%,
though volume grew at a slower rate.

      Worldwide  profits rose $17 million or 7% to $270  million.
The  profit  growth reflected lower food costs, additional  units
which  contributed  $24  million, volume gains  of  $20  million,
higher   soft  drink  prices  and  increased  franchise   royalty
revenues.   These benefits were partially offset by higher  store
operating  costs, driven by increased labor costs, an unfavorable
mix  shift  to  lower-margin  products  and  higher  headquarters
administrative  expenses.   Profit  growth  was   restrained   by
increased  losses  posted  by Hot 'n Now.   Taco  Bell  plans  to
transition  Hot  'n  Now during 1995 from  primarily  a  company-
operated  to  a licensee/franchisee-operated business.   This  is
expected to significantly reduce Hot 'n Now's operating losses in
1995.   Taco Bell worldwide profit margin fell almost 1 point  to
7.9%.

      International  operations posted strong double-digit  sales
growth,  principally due to additional units.  Volume gains  were
largely offset by an unfavorable currency translation impact of a
weaker Canadian dollar.  International operating results improved
slightly, although still resulting in a modest loss in  1994,  as
volume  gains  were partially offset by start-up  losses  of  new
units.

KFC

      Worldwide  sales rose $319 million or 14% to $2.6  billion.
The sales growth reflected additional units that contributed $193
million and volume gains of $120 million.

      Worldwide  profits  increased $12 million  or  8%  to  $165
million,  reflecting  the absence of last year's  start-up  costs
associated  with  the Colonel's Rotisserie Gold  roasted  chicken
product   and  accompanying  side  items  (collectively,  "CRG").
Higher  volumes of $40 million, additional units that contributed
$22 million and increased franchise royalty revenues were largely
offset  by  a  sales mix shift to lower-margin  products,  higher
field and headquarters administrative and support costs and lower
net  pricing.  The worldwide profit margin declined  almost  one-
half point to 6.2% due to international operations.

      The  improvement  in  KFC's  domestic  sales  reflected  an
increase in volume, as gains from CRG and the value-oriented Mega
Meal were partially offset by lower volumes of existing products,
and  higher net pricing.  Same store sales advanced 2% from  last
year, though volumes grew at a slightly slower rate.

      Domestic  profits  grew  at a double-digit  rate  in  1994.
Operating profit benefited from the absence of last year's start-
up  costs  associated with CRG.  Higher net  pricing  and  volume
gains were offset by a mix shift to the lower-margin CRG and Mega
Meal  offerings.  Reduced store operating costs, including  lower
product costs, primarily due to reformulation of side items  late
in the second quarter, and the 1994 impact of favorable actuarial
adjustments  to prior year workers' compensation claim  accruals,
were  partially offset by increased administrative costs.  Profit
growth   was  depressed  by  lapping  last  year's  $3.3  million
favorable adjustment to a 1991 reorganization accrual.



      Double-digit  international sales growth  was  led  by  the
combined  impact of acquired units in the U.K. and new  units  in
Mexico,  Australia and Canada.  The balance of the  sales  growth
reflected   volume  gains  due,  in  part,  to  new  value-priced
offerings, partially offset by the related lower net pricing.

      International  profit growth was modest.   Excluding  KFC's
share  of  the  international restaurants' consolidation  charge,
strong   single-digit  international  operating   profit   growth
reflected  gains  from  additional  units  and  higher  franchise
royalty  revenues, partially offset by increased store  operating
costs  and  higher field administrative and support  costs.   The
volume gains were offset by the lower net pricing.

      Profits increased in Australia, the largest market, and New
Zealand.   Mexico's profits declined sharply and Canada  reported
significantly lower results.

     International sales represented about 40% of worldwide sales
in 1994 and 30% in 1993.  International profits represented about
40% of worldwide profits in 1994 and 1993.

     1993 vs. 1992

      Worldwide  net  sales  rose $1.1 billion  or  14%  to  $9.4
billion.   This  advance  was driven by additional  units,  which
contributed  $913 million.  Volume growth, led by domestic  Pizza
Hut,  provided $175 million of the sales advance.  Domestic sales
grew  $910 million or 13% to $8.0 billion and international sales
rose  $213  million  or  19%  to $1.4 billion.   The  unfavorable
currency  translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar  depressed
international sales growth.

      Worldwide operating profits grew $60 million or 8% to  $778
million.  Additional units provided $89 million and volume growth
contributed  $75  million  to  the  profit  increase.   Increased
operating  costs  were partially offset by  modestly  higher  net
pricing  (principally  at domestic KFC) and  increased  franchise
royalty  revenues.  Domestic profits rose $87 million or  15%  to
$685 million, while international profits declined $27 million or
23% to $93 million reflecting weakness in Australia.

Pizza Hut

      Worldwide  sales  increased $525 million  or  15%  to  $4.2
billion.  The domestic operations represent the major portion  of
worldwide  Pizza Hut.  Additional units contributed $392  million
to  the  worldwide sales increase.  Volume growth  provided  $140
million,  driven  by  strong domestic gains  resulting  from  the
national  roll-out of the new value-priced Bigfoot Pizza  in  the
second quarter.

      Same  store  sales  advanced 5% though  volume  growth  was
slightly higher.  This performance reflected growth in all  three
distribution channels: delivery, carryout and dine-in.   Improved
sales in both delivery and carryout were driven by the success of
Bigfoot.  The growth in dine-in reflected the impact of the third
quarter  1992  roll-out of the all-you-can-eat  pizza  and  salad
lunch buffet.  Results late in 1993 indicated a softening of same
store  sales  trends  in dine-in due primarily  to  lapping  last
year's roll-out of the lunch buffet.

      Worldwide  profits  advanced $37 million  or  11%  to  $372
million.   This  profit performance reflected  $55  million  from
volume  growth,  $41  million  from additional  units,  increased
franchise royalty revenues and higher international net  pricing.
These benefits were partially offset by increased store operating
costs  as  well  as  administrative and support  expenses,  which
included  the  start-up costs associated with  Bigfoot.   Bigfoot
contributed  significantly to U.S. profit growth  as  incremental
volume, net of estimated cannibalization of other products,  more
than  offset  the effect of the product's lower  margin  and  the
start-up  costs.  Prices for cheese have fluctuated significantly
in  recent  years.   Lower cheese costs in 1993  were  offset  by
higher  meat  and produce costs.  The effect of these  increasing
costs was exacerbated by a sales mix shift to more heavily-topped
pizzas  and  the  lunch  buffet.  Though difficult  to  forecast,
commodity  costs (led by cheese) were expected to increase.   The
worldwide  profit margin declined almost one-half point  to  9.0%
due to lower international profits.




      International  sales posted double-digit growth  driven  by
additional  units in several markets, including Canada,  Belgium,
Australia,  Spain and Puerto Rico.  This benefit,  combined  with
higher net pricing and increased franchise royalty revenues,  was
partially  offset by an unfavorable currency translation  impact,
principally  in  Australia  and  Canada.   International  profits
declined  slightly, primarily reflecting an unfavorable  currency
translation  impact.  The contributions of the additional  units,
higher net pricing and increased franchise royalty revenues  were
largely   offset   by  higher  operating  expenses,   principally
development and support costs.

     In the largest sales markets, profits declined in Australia,
but  rose  in  Canada.  Australia's performance  reflected  lower
volumes,  despite  introduction of Bigfoot  Pizza  in  the  third
quarter,  and intense competitive pricing activity.   To  provide
even  greater value and stimulate volume growth in 1994,  a  more
heavily-topped  Bigfoot was relaunched late in  1993  and  a  new
value-oriented  menu  was  introduced.   Canada's  profit  growth
reflected higher net pricing, additional units and volume growth.
A  product  similar  to Bigfoot, launched in the  third  quarter,
contributed to improved results.

Taco Bell

      Worldwide  sales grew $441 million or 18% to $2.9  billion.
The  domestic operations represent substantially all of worldwide
Taco Bell.  The worldwide sales increase was driven by additional
units, which contributed $364 million, including $78 million from
additional  Hot 'n Now units and the acquired Chevys units.   The
balance of the sales growth reflected the impact of higher  store
volumes,  partially  offset by lower distribution  sales  by  PFS
caused by the late 1992/early 1993 switch to another supplier  by
certain  franchisees.  Same store sales for Taco Bell units  rose
6% due to volume growth.

      Worldwide  profits increased $39 million  or  18%  to  $253
million.   Additional units contributed $35  million  and  volume
growth  provided  $25  million.  These  benefits,  combined  with
higher franchise royalty revenues and a small decline in food and
promotional   costs,   were   partially   offset   by   increased
headquarters administrative and support expenses.  Profit  growth
was depressed by increased losses at Hot 'n Now, reflecting costs
associated with a decision to not develop certain sites  as  well
as  losses at new units.  The worldwide profit margin was even at
8.7%.   Profits in 1994 were expected to be aided by a late  1993
price increase for certain soft drink sizes.

      International operations posted double-digit  sales  growth
and  a  small loss compared to a small profit in 1992, reflecting
increased  development  and  support  costs,  as  well  as  costs
associated with a store closure in the U.K.

KFC

      Worldwide  sales rose $157 million or 7% to  $2.3  billion.
Additional   units,   principally   in   international   markets,
contributed  $158 million to sales growth.  Higher  domestic  net
pricing and increased franchise royalty revenues also aided sales
growth.   Sales  growth was depressed by an unfavorable  currency
translation impact as well as lower store volumes.

      Worldwide  profits  decreased $16 million  or  9%  to  $153
million  as lower international profits were partially offset  by
an increase domestically.  The worldwide profit decline reflected
higher  store  operating  costs, which  included  start-up  costs
associated with the roll-out of the new roasted chicken  products
in   the   U.S.   and  Australia,  and  increased   international
administrative  and  support expenses, partially  offset  by  the
higher net pricing and increased franchise royalty revenues.  The
contribution  from additional units of $13 million was  partially
offset  by  the  impact of lower volumes.  The  worldwide  profit
margin  fell  over  1  point to 6.6% due to  lower  international
profits.

     Improvement in domestic sales reflected additional units and
higher  net  pricing,  principally from a lower  level  of  price
discounting, partially offset by lower store volumes.  Same store
sales  were  about even with last year. The introduction  of  CRG
late  in the year contributed significantly to strong same  store
sales growth in the fourth quarter of 1993.




     Domestic profits grew at a high single-digit rate reflecting
the  higher  net pricing that exceeded increased store  operating
costs. This benefit, combined with the impact of additional units
and  higher franchise royalty revenues, was partially  offset  by
the  effect  of  lower  volumes.   The  profit  performance  also
reflected  a  favorable  adjustment of  the  1991   restructuring
accrual.   For the year, the benefits from incremental volume  of
CRG,  net  of  estimated cannibalization of other products,  were
more  than  offset by the effect of CRG's lower  margin  and  the
start-up  expenses  for the roll-out.  However,  CRG  contributed
significantly to profit growth in the fourth quarter of 1993.

      International sales posted double-digit growth,  driven  by
additional  units  in  Singapore, Canada  and  Mexico,  partially
offset  by an unfavorable currency translation impact.  A double-
digit decline in profits was caused principally by Australia, the
largest sales market.  Increased administrative and support costs
also contributed to the profit decline.

      Australia's  performance  was  depressed  by  the  start-up
expenses associated with its new value-priced TenderRoast chicken
product,  the combined impact of the product's lower  margin  and
its  greater than expected cannibalization of other higher-margin
products  and  an  overall decline in volumes.  Initiatives  were
underway to drive incremental sales of TenderRoast.  Canada,  the
next largest sales market, posted a relatively modest decline  in
profits   reflecting   lower  volumes  and  competitive   pricing
activity.   To  improve results in 1994 for  both  Australia  and
Canada,  KFC introduced new value-oriented menus and  rolled  out
delivery in certain markets.

     International sales represented about 30% of worldwide sales
in  1993 and 1992. International profits represented about 40% of
worldwide profits in 1993 and 50% in 1992.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires estimates
and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial
statements  and  related  notes.  Actual results could  differ  from  those
estimates.   Certain reclassifications were made to prior year  amounts  to
conform  with  the 1994 presentation.  Significant accounting policies  are
discussed below, or where applicable, in the Notes that follow.
      Principles  of Consolidation.  The financial statements  reflect  the
consolidated  accounts  of  PepsiCo, Inc. and  its  controlled  affiliates.
Intercompany  accounts and transactions have been eliminated.   Investments
in  affiliates  in  which PepsiCo exercises significant influence  but  not
control are accounted for by the equity method and the equity in net income
is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
     Marketing Costs.  Marketing costs are reported in Selling, general and
administrative  expenses  and include costs of advertising,  marketing  and
promotional  programs.  Promotional discounts are expensed as incurred  and
other  marketing  costs  not deferred at year-end are  charged  to  expense
ratably  in  relation to sales over the year in which incurred.   Marketing
costs   deferred  at  year-end  consist  of  media  and  personal   service
advertising prepayments, promotional materials in inventory and  production
costs  of  future media advertising; these assets are expensed in the  year
first used.
      Promotional  discounts  to  retailers in  the  beverage  segment  are
classified  as  a  reduction  of sales; in the  snack  food  segment,  such
discounts  are generally classified as marketing costs.  The difference  in
classification reflects our historical view that promotional discounts  had
become  so  pervasive in the beverage industry, compared to the snack  food
industry,  that  they  were  effectively  price  discounts  and  should  be
classified accordingly.  This differing accounting classification was  also
supported by a survey of the accounting practice of others in the  beverage
and  snack foods industries.  PepsiCo plans to review its accounting policy
in  1995  to determine whether the different accounting classification  for
beverages and snack foods still reflects the substance of the activity  and
whether  it  continues  to  be consistent with others  in  our  industries.
Depending  on the outcome of the review, PepsiCo may change its  accounting
classification of beverage or snack food promotional discounts.  Any change
will   not  impact  reported  earnings  as  it  would  only  result  in   a
reclassification of the cost of promotional discounts between Net Sales and
Selling, general and administrative expenses.
      Cash  Equivalents.   Cash  equivalents  represent  funds  temporarily
invested (with original maturities not exceeding three months) as  part  of
PepsiCo's   management   of   day-to-day  operating   cash   receipts   and
disbursements.  All other investment portfolios, largely held  outside  the
U.S., are primarily classified as short-term investments.
      Net  Income Per Share.  Net income per share is computed by  dividing
net  income  by the weighted average number of shares and share equivalents
outstanding during each year.
     Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses,
which  are expensed as incurred, were $152 million, $113 million  and  $102
million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
      Fiscal  Year.   PepsiCo's fiscal year ends on the  last  Saturday  in
December and, as a result, a fifty-third week is added every 5 or 6  years.
The fiscal year ending December 31, 1994 consisted of 53 weeks.

Note 2 - Business Segments

Business Segments

PepsiCo  operates  on  a  worldwide basis within three  industry  segments:
beverages,  snack  foods and restaurants.  The beverage  segment  primarily
markets its Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew and other brands worldwide  and
7UP  internationally, and manufactures concentrates for its brands for sale
to  franchised  bottlers  worldwide.  The segment  also  operates  bottling
plants  and  distribution facilities located in the  U.S.  and  in  various
international  markets,  and  manufactures and  distributes  ready-to-drink
Lipton  tea  products  in  North  America.   In  addition,  under  separate
distribution and joint venture agreements, the segment distributes  certain
previously  existing, as well as manufactures and distributes new  jointly-
developed,  Ocean Spray juice products in the U.S. and Canada.   The  snack
food  segment manufactures, distributes and markets chips and other  snacks
worldwide,   with  Frito-Lay  representing  the  domestic  business.    The
international snack food business includes major operations in Mexico,  the
U.K.  and  Canada.   The  restaurant  segment  consists  primarily  of  the
operations  of  the worldwide Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and  KFC  chains.   PFS,
PepsiCo's  restaurant  distribution operation, supplies  company-owned  and
franchised  restaurants, principally in the U.S.  Net sales  and  operating
profits  of  PFS'  franchisee  operations  have  been  allocated  to   each
restaurant chain.
      Unallocated  Expenses, net includes corporate headquarters  expenses,
minority  interests, primarily in the Gamesa (Mexico)  and  Wedel  (Poland)
snack  food businesses, foreign exchange translation and transaction  gains
and  losses  and  other  corporate items  not  allocated  to  the  business
segments.   Corporate Identifiable Assets consist principally of short-term
investments held outside the U.S. and investments in affiliates.
       PepsiCo  has  invested  in  about  75  joint  ventures,  principally
international and all within PepsiCo's three industry segments, in which it
exercises  significant influence but not control.  Equity in net income  of
these  affiliates  was  $37.8, $30.1, and $40.1 in  1994,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.   The increase in 1994 primarily reflected increased  profits
at  Snack  Ventures Europe (SVE).  The decline in 1993 primarily  reflected
the  expansion costs in a beverage affiliate in India and lower profits  at
SVE.   International snack food affiliates, which represented  the  largest
component  of equity in net income of affiliates, contributed $34.3,  $24.1
and  $23.2  in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Dividends received  from
affiliates  totaled  $33.1,  $16.4  and  $29.6  in  1994,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.
      PepsiCo's year-end investments in affiliates totaled $1.3 billion  in
1994,  $1.1  billion  in 1993 and $904.9 in 1992.   The  increase  in  1994
reflected  advances to California Pizza Kitchen (CPK),  a  domestic  casual
dining  restaurant  chain,  and  investments  in  international  franchised
bottling  operations  in  Thailand  and  China,  partially  offset  by  the
translation  impact  of  the late 1994 devaluation  of  the  Mexican  peso.
Significant investments in affiliates at year-end 1994 included  $234.3  in
General Bottlers, a U.S. franchised bottler, $162.9 in CPK, $160.2 in a KFC
Japan  joint venture, $123.2 in BAESA, a franchised bottler with operations
in South America, and $80.9 in SVE.

Items Affecting Comparability

Fiscal Year
1994 consisted of 53 weeks and the years 1989 through 1993 consisted of  52
weeks.  The estimated favorable impact on net sales of the fifty-third week

 F-10

was  $433.5,  increasing beverage, snack food and restaurant net  sales  by
$118.9, $142.6 and $172.0, respectively.  The estimated favorable impact on
operating  profits of the fifty-third week was $64.5, increasing  beverage,
snack  food  and  restaurant operating profits by $16.8, $26.0  and  $22.9,
respectively, and increasing unallocated expenses, net by $1.2.

Unusual Items
Unusual  charges totaled $193.5 in 1992, $170.0 in 1991 and $83.0 in  1990.
These unusual items were as follows:
      Beverages - 1992 included $145.0 in charges consisting of $115.4  and
$29.6  to  reorganize and streamline domestic and international operations,
respectively.  1990 included a $10.5 domestic charge for trade  receivables
exposures.
      Snack Foods - 1992 included a $40.3 charge principally to consolidate
the  Walkers  businesses  in  the U.K.  1991  included  $127.0  in  charges
consisting  of $91.4 and $23.6 to streamline domestic and U.K.  operations,
respectively,  and $12.0 to dispose of all or part of a small  unprofitable
business  in  Japan.   1990  included a $10.6  domestic  charge  for  trade
receivables exposures.
      Restaurants  -  1991 included $43.0 in charges at KFC  consisting  of
$34.0 to streamline operations and $9.0 related to a delay in the U.S. roll-
out  of a new product.  1990 included $28.0 in charges consisting of  $17.6
for  closure of certain underperforming restaurants (Pizza Hut - $9.0, Taco
Bell  - $4.0 and KFC - $4.6) and $10.4 for reorganization charges for Pizza
Hut.
     Unallocated Expenses, net - 1992 included an $8.2 charge to streamline
operations  of  the  SVE  joint venture.  1990 included  $33.9  in  charges
consisting of $18.0 for accelerated contributions to the PepsiCo Foundation
and  $15.9  to  reduce  the carrying amount of an international  Pizza  Hut
affiliate.
      See  Note  16  and Management's Analysis of beverage and  snack  food
performance  on pages 15 and 19, respectively, for additional information  on
restructurings.

Accounting Changes
In  1994,  PepsiCo adopted a preferred method for calculating  the  market-
related  value  of plan assets used in determining annual  pension  expense
(see  Note 13) and extended the depreciable lives on certain domestic Pizza
Hut delivery assets.  As compared to the previous accounting methods, these
changes  increased  1994  operating profit by $49.1,  increasing  beverage,
snack  food  and restaurant profits by $12.4, $15.5 and $19.6  (almost  all
domestic), respectively, and decreasing 1994 unallocated expenses,  net  by
$1.6.
      In 1992, PepsiCo adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  106 and 109, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits  Other
Than  Pensions"  and  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes,"  respectively.   As
compared  to  the previous accounting methods, these changes  reduced  1992
operating  profit by $72.8, decreasing beverage, snack food and  restaurant
profits  by  $22.4,  $30.8  and $15.4, respectively,  and  increasing  1992
unallocated expenses, net by $4.2.  See Notes 12 and 17, respectively.

Note 3 - Items Affecting Comparability

The fifty-third week, as described in Note 1, increased earnings in 1994 by
approximately $54.0 million ($34.9 million after-tax or $0.04  per  share).
See  Items  Affecting Comparability on page F-9 for the estimated impact  of
the fifty-third week on comparability of net sales and operating profits.
      The  effects  of unusual items, primarily restructuring charges,  and
accounting  changes on comparability of operating profits are  provided  in
Items Affecting Comparability on page F-10.
      Information regarding the 1994 gain from a public share  offering  by
PepsiCo's  BAESA joint venture and a 1993 charge to increase  net  deferred
tax  liabilities as of the beginning of 1993 for a 1% statutory income  tax
rate increase due to 1993 U.S. tax legislation are provided in Notes 4  and
17, respectively.

Note 4 - Joint Venture Stock Offering

In   1993,   PepsiCo  entered  into  an  arrangement  with  the   principal
shareholders  of  Buenos  Aires Embotelladora S.A.  (BAESA),  a  franchised
bottler  with operations in Argentina and Costa Rica.  PepsiCo  contributed
certain  assets, primarily bottling operations in Chile and Uruguay,  while
the  shareholders  contributed all of their outstanding  shares  in  BAESA,
representing  72.8%  of  the  voting control and  42.5%  of  the  ownership
interest.  Through this arrangement, PepsiCo's ownership in BAESA, which is
accounted for by the equity method, was 25.9%.
      On  March 24, 1994, BAESA completed a public offering of 2.9  million
American Depositary Shares (ADS) at $34.50 per ADS, which are traded on the
New  York  Stock Exchange.  In conjunction with the offering,  PepsiCo  and
certain  other  shareholders exercised options for the  equivalent  of  1.6
million  ADS.   As a result of these transactions, PepsiCo's  ownership  in
BAESA  declined  to  23.8%.  The transactions generated cash  proceeds  for
BAESA  of $136.4 million.  The resulting one-time, noncash gain to  PepsiCo
was $17.8 million ($16.8 million after-tax or $0.02 per share).

Note 5 - Acquisitions and Investments in Affiliates

During  1994,  PepsiCo  completed acquisitions  and  affiliate  investments
aggregating $355 million, principally for cash.  In addition, approximately
$41  million of debt was assumed in these transactions, most of  which  was
subsequently  retired.   This  activity  included  equity  investments   in
international  franchised bottling operations, primarily  in  Thailand  and
China, and acquisitions of international and domestic franchised restaurant
operations and franchised and independent bottling operations, primarily in
India and Mexico.
      During 1993, PepsiCo completed acquisitions and affiliate investments
aggregating $1.4 billion, principally comprised of $1.0 billion in cash and
$335  million in PepsiCo Capital Stock.  Approximately $307 million of debt
was assumed in these transactions, more than half of which was subsequently
retired.  This activity included acquisitions of domestic and international
franchised  restaurant  operations, the buyout of PepsiCo's  joint  venture
partners  in  a  franchised bottling operation in  Spain  and  the  related
acquisition  of  their fruit-flavored beverage concentrate  operation,  the
acquisition  of  the remaining 85% interest in a large franchised  bottling
operation in the Northwestern U.S., the acquisition of a regional  Mexican-
style casual dining restaurant chain in the U.S. and equity investments  in
certain franchised bottling operations in Argentina and Mexico.

 F-19

     During 1992, acquisitions and affiliate investment activity aggregated
$1.4  billion,  principally  for  cash.  In  addition,  approximately  $218
million  of  debt  was assumed in these transactions,  most  of  which  was
subsequently retired.  This activity included acquisitions of international
(primarily Canada) and domestic franchised bottling operations and a number
of  domestic and international franchised restaurant operations, the buyout
of PepsiCo's joint venture partner in a Canadian snack food business and an
equity  investment in a domestic casual dining restaurant  chain  featuring
gourmet   pizza.    In  addition,  PepsiCo  exchanged  certain   previously
consolidated snack food operations in Europe with a net book value  of  $87
million  for  a  60% equity interest in an international snack  food  joint
venture with General Mills, Inc.  PepsiCo secured a controlling interest in
its  Mexican cookie affiliate, Gamesa, through an exchange of certain  non-
cookie operations of Gamesa for its joint venture partner's interest.
      The  acquisitions  have been accounted for by  the  purchase  method;
accordingly,  their  results  are included in  the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  from  their  respective dates of  acquisition.   The  aggregate
impact  of acquisitions was not material to PepsiCo's net sales, net income
or  net income per share; accordingly, no related pro forma information  is
provided.

Note 6 - Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the average, first-
in, first-out or last-in, first-out [LIFO] method) or net realizable value.
The  cost  of  38%  of  1994 inventories and 41% of  1993  inventories  was
computed using the LIFO method.  Use of the LIFO method increased the total
1994  and  1993 year-end inventory amounts below by $5.5 million  and  $8.9
million, respectively.


                                       1994         1993

Raw materials and supplies            $454.8       $463.9
Finished goods                         515.2        460.8
                                      $970.0       $924.7

      See page 8 of Management's Analysis - Overview, for a discussion  of
PepsiCo's  use of futures contracts to hedge its exposure to  market  price
fluctuations  for  certain  raw  materials.   Gains  and  losses  on  these
contracts  are  deferred and included in the related cost of raw  materials
when  purchased.  Gains and losses realized in 1994 or deferred at year-end
were  not  significant.  As of December 31, 1994, PepsiCo had various  open
contracts, generally expiring by December 1995, which were not material.

Note 7 - Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.   Depreciation  is
calculated  principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated  useful
lives of the assets.  Depreciation expense in 1994, 1993 and 1992 was  $1.2
billion, $1.1 billion and $923 million, respectively.

Note 8 - Intangible Assets

Identifiable intangible assets arose from the allocation of purchase prices
of  businesses  acquired  and consist principally of  reacquired  franchise
rights  and trademarks.  Reacquired franchise rights relate to acquisitions
of franchised bottling and restaurant operations and trademarks principally
relate    to   acquisitions  of  international  snack  food  and   beverage
trademarks.  Amounts assigned to such identifiable intangibles  were  based
on  independent appraisals or internal estimates.  Goodwill represents  the
residual purchase price after allocation to all identifiable net assets.
      Intangible  assets  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over
appropriate  periods  generally ranging from 20 to 40  years.   Accumulated
amortization,  included in the amounts below, was  $1.6  billion  and  $1.3
billion at year-end 1994 and 1993, respectively.

                                     1994         1993

Reacquired franchise rights        $3,974.0    $3,959.7
Trademarks                            768.5       849.1
Other identifiable
 intangibles                          249.7       204.1
Goodwill                            2,849.9     2,916.6
                                   $7,842.1    $7,929.5

      The  recoverability  of  carrying amounts  of  intangible  assets  is
evaluated  on  a recurring basis.  The primary indicators of recoverability
are  current or forecasted profitability over the estimated remaining  life
of  the intangible assets, measured as the combined operating profit of the
acquired  business  (including amortization of the intangible  assets)  and
existing  businesses  that are directly related to the  acquired  business.
Consideration  is  also given to the estimated disposal values  of  certain
identifiable  intangible  assets compared to their  carrying  amounts.   If
recoverability of an intangible asset is unlikely based on the  evaluation,
the  carrying  amount  is reduced by the amount it exceeds  the  forecasted
operating  profits and any disposal value. For the three-year period  ended
December  31,  1994, there were no significant adjustments to the  carrying
amounts of the intangible assets resulting from these evaluations.

      The interest rates in the above table indicate, where applicable, the
weighted average rates at year-end 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     The carrying amount of long-term debt includes any related discount or
premium  and unamortized debt issuance costs.  The debt agreements  include
various  restrictions, none of which are presently significant to  PepsiCo.
Subsequent  to year-end 1994, PepsiCo issued $150 million of Notes  through
February 7, 1995.
      The  annual  maturities  of long-term debt  through  1999,  excluding
capital lease obligations and the reclassified short-term borrowings,  are:
1995-$1.0 billion, 1996-$1.1 billion, 1997-$1.0 billion, 1998-$1.2  billion
and 1999-$280 million.
      See  Management's Analysis - Overview on page 8 for a discussion  of
PepsiCo's use of interest rate swaps and currency exchange agreements   and
its management of the inherent credit risk and Note 10.

 F-22

      (A)   The  following table indicates the notional amount and weighted
average interest rates, by category, of interest rate swaps outstanding  at
year-end  1994  and  1993,  respectively.  The  weighted  average  variable
interest  rates  that PepsiCo pays, which are indexed primarily  to  either
commercial  paper or LIBOR rates, are based on rates as of  the  respective
balance sheet date and are subject to change.  Terms of interest rate  swap
agreements  match the debt they modify and terminate in 1995 through  2008.
The  differential to be paid or received on interest rate swaps is  accrued
as  interest  rates change and is charged or credited to  interest  expense
over the life of the agreements.  The carrying amount of each interest rate
swap  is  reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as  a  receivable  or
payable under the appropriate current asset or liability caption.

interest  rate  swaps.  All short-term borrowings are  considered  variable
interest rate debt for purposes of this table.

      (B)   At year-end 1994 and 1993, PepsiCo had unused revolving  credit
facilities   covering  potential  borrowings  aggregating   $3.5   billion.
Effective  January 3, 1995, PepsiCo replaced its existing credit facilities
with  new  revolving credit facilities aggregating $4.5 billion,  of  which
$1.0  billion expire in 1996 and $3.5 billion expire in 2000.  At  year-end
1994  and  1993, $4.5 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, of short-term
borrowings  were classified as long-term debt, reflecting PepsiCo's  intent
and  ability,  through  the existence of the unused credit  facilities,  to
refinance  these  borrowings.   These credit facilities  exist  largely  to
support  the  issuances  of short-term borrowings  and  are  available  for
acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
      (C)  The coupon rate of the Swiss franc 400 million perpetual Foreign
Interest  Payment bonds issued in 1986 is 7 1/2% through 1996.   The  bonds
have no stated maturity date.  At the end of each 10-year period after  the
issuance  of the bonds, PepsiCo and the bondholders each have the right  to
cause  redemption of the bonds.  If not redeemed, the coupon rate  will  be
adjusted based on the prevailing yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities.
The  principal of the bonds is denominated in Swiss francs.   PepsiCo  can,
and  intends  to, limit the ultimate redemption amount to the  U.S.  dollar
proceeds  at issuance, which is the basis of the carrying amount.  Interest
payments are made in U.S. dollars and are calculated by applying the coupon
rate to the original U.S. dollar principal proceeds of $214 million.
      (D)   PepsiCo has entered into currency exchange agreements to  hedge
its   foreign  currency  exposure  on  these  issues  of  non-U.S.   dollar
denominated  debt.   At year-end 1994, the carrying  amount  of  this  debt
aggregated  $301  million and the receivables and  payables  under  related
currency  exchange  agreements  aggregated  $50  million  and  $2  million,
respectively,  resulting in a net effective U.S. dollar liability  of  $253
million  with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6%.  At year-end  1993,
the aggregate carrying amount of the debt and the receivables under related
currency   exchange  agreements  were  $160  million   and   $41   million,
respectively,  resulting in a net effective U.S. dollar liability  of  $119
million  with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 6.5%.  The carrying
amount of each currency exchange agreement is reflected in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as a receivable or payable under the appropriate current  and
noncurrent asset and liability captions.  Changes in the carrying amount of
a  currency  exchange agreement resulting from exchange rate movements  are
offset  by  changes in the carrying amount of the related  non-U.S.  dollar
denominated debt, as both amounts are based on current exchange rates.

Note 10 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The   carrying  amounts  in  the  following  table  are  included  in   the
Consolidated Balance Sheet under the indicated captions, except  for  debt-
related  derivative instruments (interest rate swaps and currency  exchange
agreements),  which are included in the appropriate current  or  noncurrent
asset  or  liability  caption.   Investments  consist  primarily  of   debt
securities  and  have  been  classified  as  held-to-maturity.   Noncurrent
investments mature at various dates through 2000.
      Because  of  the  short maturity of cash equivalents  and  short-term
investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.  The  fair  value
of  noncurrent investments is based upon market quotes.  The fair value  of
debt, debt-related derivative instruments and guarantees is estimated using
market quotes, valuation models and calculations based on market rates.
      See  Management's Analysis - Overview on page 8 and Note 9 for  more
information  regarding PepsiCo's use of interest rate  swaps  and  currency
exchange agreements and its management of the inherent credit risk.

Note 11 - Leases

PepsiCo  has  noncancelable commitments under both  capital  and  long-term
operating  leases, primarily for restaurant units.  Certain of these  units
have  been  subleased to restaurant franchisees.  In addition,  PepsiCo  is
lessee   under  noncancelable  leases  covering  vehicles,  equipment   and
nonrestaurant real estate.  Capital and operating lease commitments  expire
at  various  dates  through  2088 and, in  many  cases,  provide  for  rent
escalations  and  renewal options. Most leases require payment  of  related
executory costs which include property taxes, maintenance and insurance.
       Future   minimum   commitments  and   sublease   receivables   under
noncancelable leases are as follows:

Note 12 - Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

PepsiCo  provides  postretirement health care benefits to eligible  retired
employees and their dependents, principally in the U.S.  Retirees who  have
10  years  of  service and attain age 55 while in service with PepsiCo  are
eligible to participate in the postretirement benefit plans.  The plans are
not funded and were largely noncontributory through 1993.
      In  1992, PepsiCo adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  106,  "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits  Other  Than
Pensions."   The cumulative effect of this change in accounting  for  years
prior to 1992 resulted in a noncash charge of $575.3 million pretax ($356.7
million after-tax or $0.44 per share).
      Effective in 1993 and 1994, PepsiCo implemented programs intended  to
stem rising costs and introduced retiree cost-sharing, including adopting a
provision  which  limits its future obligation to absorb health  care  cost
inflation.  These amendments resulted in an unrecognized prior service gain
of $191 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the
average  remaining employee service period of 10 years as  a  reduction  in
postretirement benefit expense beginning in 1993.
      The  postretirement benefit expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992  included
the following components:

______________________________________________________________________________
                                            1994        1993      1992
______________________________________________________________________________
Service cost of benefits earned           $ 18.6       $ 14.7    $25.5
Interest cost on accumulated
 postretirement benefit obligation          41.4         40.6     50.8
Amortization  of prior service (gain) cost (19.6)       (19.6)     0.1
Amortization of net loss                     5.6          0.5        -

                                          $ 46.0       $ 36.2    $76.4
______________________________________________________________________________
 F-26

      The  decline  in  the  1993 expense was primarily  due  to  the  plan
amendments, reflecting reductions in service and interest costs as well  as
the amortization of the unrecognized prior service gain.
      The  1994  and  1993  postretirement benefit liability  included  the
following components:
______________________________________________________________________________
                                                     1994        1993

______________________________________________________________________________
      The discount rate assumptions used in computing the information above
were as follows:
                                        1994      1993      1992

     Postretirement benefit expense     6.8%      8.2       8.9
     Accumulated postretirement
      benefit obligation                9.1%      6.8       8.2

      The  year-to-year  fluctuations  in  the  discount  rate  assumptions
primarily  reflect  changes  in U.S. interest  rates.   The  discount  rate
represents  the expected yield on a portfolio of high-grade  (AA  rated  or
equivalent)  fixed-income investments with cash flow streams sufficient  to
satisfy benefit obligations under the plans when due.
      As  a result of the plan amendments discussed above, separate assumed
health  care cost trend rates are used for employees who retire before  and
after  the effective date of the amendments.  The assumed health care  cost
trend rate for employees who retired before the effective date is 9.5%  for
1995,  declining gradually to 5.5% in 2005 and thereafter.   For  employees
retiring  after  the  effective date, the trend  rate  is  8.0%  for  1995,
declining  gradually to 0% in 2005 and thereafter.  A 1 point  increase  in
the  assumed  health  care cost trend rate would have  increased  the  1994
postretirement benefit expense by $2.0 million and would have increased the
1994 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $20.6 million.

Note 13 - Pension Plans

PepsiCo  sponsors  noncontributory defined benefit pension  plans  covering
substantially all full-time domestic employees as well as contributory  and
noncontributory   defined   benefit   pension   plans   covering    certain
international employees.  Benefits generally are based on years of  service
and compensation or stated amounts for each year of service.  PepsiCo funds
the  domestic  plans  in  amounts not less than minimum  statutory  funding
requirements  nor  more than the maximum amount that can  be  deducted  for
federal  income  tax purposes.  International plans are funded  in  amounts

 F-27

sufficient to comply with local statutory requirements.  The plans'  assets
consist  principally of equity securities, government  and  corporate  debt
securities  and  other fixed income obligations.  For 1994  and  1993,  the
domestic plan assets included 6.9 million shares of PepsiCo Capital  Stock,
with  a  market  value of $227.2 million and $265.7 million,  respectively.
Dividends  on  PepsiCo Capital Stock of $4.7 million and $4.0 million  were
received by the domestic plans in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
      The  international plans presented below are primarily  comprised  of
those in the U.K. and Canada for all three years as well as those in Mexico
and  Japan  for 1994 and 1993.  Information for 1992 has not been restated,
since complete information for plans in Mexico and Japan was not available.

      The  discount  rates and rates of return for the international  plans
represent weighted averages.

      The  year-to-year  fluctuations  in  the  discount  rate  assumptions
primarily  reflect changes in interest rates.  The discount rates represent
the  expected  yield on a portfolio of high-grade (AA rated or  equivalent)
fixed-income  investments  with  cash flow streams  sufficient  to  satisfy
benefit  obligations under the plans when due.  The higher assumed discount
rates used to measure the 1994 projected benefit obligation compared to the
assumed discount rate used to measure the 1993 projected benefit obligation
changed the funded status of certain plans from underfunded to overfunded.
     In 1994, PepsiCo changed the method for calculating the market-related
value  of plan assets used in determining the return-on-asset component  of
annual  pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized  gain  or  loss
subject  to  amortization.   Under  the  previous  accounting  method,  the
calculation of the market-related value of assets reflected amortization of
the  actual capital return on assets on a straight-line basis over a  five-
year  period.   Under the new method, the calculation of the market-related
value  of assets reflects the long-term rate of return expected by  PepsiCo
and  amortization  of the difference between the actual  return  (including
capital,  dividends and interest) and the expected return over a  five-year
period.   PepsiCo  believes the new method is widely used in  practice  and
preferable  because it results in calculated plan asset  values  that  more
closely approximate fair value, while still mitigating the effect of annual
market-value  fluctuations.  Under both methods, only  the  cumulative  net
unrecognized gain or loss which exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected
benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets is subject to
amortization.  This change resulted in a noncash benefit in 1994  of  $37.8
million  ($23.3  million  after-tax or $0.03 per  share)  representing  the
cumulative  effect of the change related to years prior to 1994  and  $35.1
million  in  lower pension expense ($21.6 million after-tax  or  $0.03  per
share) related to 1994 as compared to the previous accounting method.   Had
this  change  been applied retroactively, pension expense would  have  been
reduced  by $16.4 million ($10.7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share)  and
$9.5  million ($6.5 million after-tax or $0.01 per share) in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

Note 14 - Postemployment Benefits Other Than to Retirees

Effective  the  beginning of 1994, PepsiCo adopted Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  112  (SFAS  112),  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Postemployment Benefits." SFAS 112 requires PepsiCo to accrue the  cost  of
certain  postemployment  benefits to be  paid  to  terminated  or  inactive
employees  other  than retirees.  The principal effect to  PepsiCo  results
from  accruing  severance benefits to be provided to employees  of  certain
business  units who are terminated in the ordinary course of business  over
the  expected  service lives of the employees.  Previously, these  benefits
were accrued upon the occurrence of an event.  Severance benefits resulting
from  actions  not in the ordinary course of business will continue  to  be
accrued  when  those  actions  occur.  The cumulative  effect  charge  upon
adoption  of  SFAS  112, which relates to years prior to  1994,  was  $84.6
million ($55.3 million after-tax or $0.07 per share).  As compared  to  the
previous  accounting method, the current year impact of adopting  SFAS  112
was  immaterial to 1994 operating profits.  PepsiCo's cash flows have  been
unaffected  by this accounting change as PepsiCo continues to largely  fund
postemployment benefit costs as incurred.

Note 15 - Franchise Arrangements

Franchise  arrangements with restaurant franchisees generally  provide  for
initial  fees  and  continuing royalty payments to  PepsiCo  based  upon  a
percentage  of sales.  The arrangements are intended to assist  franchisees
through,  among  other things, product development and  marketing  programs
initiated  by PepsiCo for both its company-owned and franchised operations.
On a limited basis, franchisees have also entered into leases of restaurant
properties  leased  or owned by PepsiCo (see Note 11).   Royalty  revenues,
initial  fees and rental payments from franchisees, which are  included  in
Net  Sales, aggregated $407 million, $357 million and $344 million in 1994,
1993  and  1992, respectively.  Franchise royalty revenues, which represent
the  majority  of these amounts, are recognized when earned.  PepsiCo  also
has franchise arrangements with beverage bottlers, which do not provide for
royalty payments.

Note 16 - Restructurings

PepsiCo  recorded restructuring charges of $193.5 million in  1992  ($128.5
million  after-tax or $0.16 per share) and $149.0 million in  1991  ($102.3
million after-tax or $0.13 per share).  The 1992 charge related principally
to   streamlining   and  reorganizing  the  domestic   beverage   business,
consolidating  the  snack food businesses in the U.K. and  streamlining  an
acquired  beverage bottling business in Spain.  The 1991 charge related  to
streamlining  snack food operations in the U.S. and U.K. and operations  at
KFC.   These charges were classified in Selling, general and administrative
expenses  and were primarily for costs requiring future cash outlays.   The
annual  accrual  activity, including asset valuation  allowances,  and  the
related components were as follows:

respectively.

Note 17 - Income Taxes

In  1992,  PepsiCo adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  No.
109  (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes."  PepsiCo elected  to  adopt
SFAS  109 on a prospective basis, resulting in a noncash tax charge in 1992
of $570.7 million ($0.71 per share) for the cumulative effect of the change
related   to  years  prior  to  1992.   The  cumulative  effect   primarily
represented the recording of additional deferred tax liabilities related to
identifiable   intangible  assets,  principally  acquired  trademarks   and
reacquired  franchise rights, that have no tax bases.  These  deferred  tax
liabilities would be paid only in the unlikely event the related intangible
assets were sold in taxable transactions.
       Detail of the provision for income taxes on income before cumulative
effect of accounting changes was as follows:

       In 1993, a charge of $29.9 million ($0.04 per share) was recorded to
increase net deferred tax liabilities as of the beginning of 1993 for a  1%
statutory  income  tax rate increase under 1993 U.S. tax legislation.   The
effect  of  the  higher  rate  on the 1993 increase  in  net  deferred  tax
liabilities through the enactment date of the legislation was immaterial.

       PepsiCo operates centralized concentrate manufacturing facilities in
Puerto Rico and Ireland under long-term tax incentives.  The foreign amount

______________________________________________________________________________
      The  valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets increased  by
$70.3 million in 1994 primarily resulting from additions related to current
year  net operating losses, partially offset by reversals related to  prior
year  net  operating losses.  The net operating loss carryforwards  largely
related to a number of state and foreign jurisdictions and generally expire
over a range of dates.
        Deferred  tax  liabilities  have  not  been  recognized  for  bases
differences  related  to  investments in  foreign  subsidiaries  and  joint
ventures.    These  differences,  which  consist  primarily  of  unremitted
earnings  intended to be indefinitely reinvested, aggregated  approximately
$3.8  billion at year-end 1994 and $3.2 billion at year-end 1993, exclusive
of  amounts that if remitted in the future would result in little or no tax
under   current  tax  laws  and  the  Puerto  Rico  tax  incentive   grant.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities is not
practicable.
       Tax  benefits  associated with exercises of stock options  of  $27.1
million  in  1994,  $23.4 million in 1993 and $57.5 million  in  1992  were
credited  to shareholders' equity.  A change in the functional currency  of
operations  in  Mexico  from  the U.S. dollar to  local  currency  in  1993
resulted  in  a  $19.3  million decrease in the net  deferred  foreign  tax
liability that was credited to shareholders' equity.

Note 18 - Employee Incentive Plans

PepsiCo  has  established certain employee incentive plans under  which
stock  options  are  granted.  A stock option  allows  an  employee  to
purchase  a share of PepsiCo Capital Stock (Stock) in the future  at  a
price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant.
     Under  the PepsiCo SharePower Stock Option Plan, approved  by  the
Board  of  Directors and effective in 1989, essentially  all  employees
other  than  executive officers, part-time and short-service  employees
may  be  granted stock options annually.  The number of options granted
is  based  on  each employee's annual earnings.  The options  generally
become exercisable ratably over five years from the grant date and must
be  exercised  within 10 years of the grant date.   SharePower  options
were  granted  to  approximately 128,000  employees  in  1994,  118,000
employees in 1993 and 114,000 employees in 1992.
     The  shareholder-approved 1987 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  1987
Plan), which has provisions similar to prior plans, provides incentives
to  eligible  senior and middle management employees.  In  addition  to
grants of stock options, which are generally exercisable between 1  and
15  years  from  the  grant date, the 1987 Plan allows  for  grants  of
performance share units (PSUs) to eligible senior management employees.
A  PSU is equivalent in value to a share of Stock at the grant date and
vests  for  payment  four years from the grant  date,  contingent  upon
attainment  of prescribed Corporate performance goals.   PSUs  are  not
directly  granted, as certain stock options granted may be  surrendered
by  employees  for a specified number of PSUs within  60  days  of  the
option   grant  date.   During  1994,  1,541,187  stock  options   were
surrendered  for 513,729 PSUs.  At year-end 1994, 1993 and 1992,  there
were 629,202, 491,200 and 484,698 outstanding PSUs, respectively.
     Grants  under  the  1987  Plan are approved  by  the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee), which is  composed
of  outside  directors.  Payment of awards other than stock options  is
made  in  cash and/or Stock as approved by the Committee,  and  amounts
expensed for such awards were $7 million, $5 million and $11 million in
1994,  1993 and 1992, respectively.  Under the 1987 Plan, a maximum  of
54 million shares of Stock can be purchased or paid pursuant to grants.

There  were  7  million, 20 million, 22 million and 32  million  shares
available  for  future grants at year-end 1994, 1993,  1992  and  1991,
respectively.   The  Committee does not intend to grant  future  awards
under the 1987 Plan.
     On May 4, 1994, PepsiCo's shareholders approved the 1994 Long-Term
Incentive  Plan (the 1994 Plan).  The 1994 Plan continues the principal
features of the 1987 Plan and authorizes a maximum of 75 million shares
of  Stock  which  may be purchased or paid pursuant to  grants  by  the
Committee.   The  first  awards under the 1994 Plan  were  made  as  of
January 1, 1995.
    1994, 1993 and 1992 activity for the stock option plans included:

Note 19 - Contingencies

PepsiCo is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,
taxes, environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course  of
business.   Management  believes that the ultimate liability,  if  any,  in
excess   of   amounts  already  provided  arising  from  such   claims   or
contingencies is not likely to have a material adverse effect on  PepsiCo's
annual results of operations or financial condition.  At year-end 1994  and
1993,  PepsiCo  was contingently liable under guarantees  aggregating  $187
million  and  $276  million, respectively.  The  guarantees  are  primarily
issued to support financial arrangements of certain PepsiCo joint ventures,
and   bottling  and  restaurant  franchisees.   PepsiCo  manages  the  risk
associated  with these guarantees by performing appropriate credit  reviews
in  addition  to  retaining certain rights as a joint  venture  partner  or
franchisor.  See Note 10 for information related to the fair value  of  the
guarantees.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

Management is responsible for the reliability of the consolidated financial
statements  and related notes, which have been prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based upon our
estimates  and judgments, as required.  The financial statements have  been
audited and reported on by our independent auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP,
who  were  given  free access to all financial records  and  related  data,
including  minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees
of  the Board.  We believe that the representations made to the independent
auditors were valid and appropriate.

      PepsiCo  maintains  a  system  of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of
the  financial statements.  The system is supported by formal policies  and
procedures, including an active Code of Conduct program intended to  ensure
employees  adhere  to  the highest standards of personal  and  professional
integrity.  PepsiCo's internal audit function monitors and reports  on  the
adequacy   of  and  compliance  with  the  internal  control  system,   and
appropriate  actions are taken to address significant control  deficiencies
and  other  opportunities for improving the system as they are  identified.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely  of
outside  directors, provides oversight to the financial  reporting  process
through  periodic meetings with our independent auditors, internal auditors
and  management.  Both our independent auditors and internal auditors  have
free access to the Audit Committee.

      Although no cost effective internal control system will preclude  all
errors and irregularities, we believe our controls as of December 31,  1994
provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are reliable.

Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.


We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  of  PepsiCo,
Inc.  and  Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and December 25, 1993,  and
the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders'
equity  for  each of the years in the three-year period ended December  31,
1994.   These  consolidated financial statements are the responsibility  of
PepsiCo, Inc.'s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis,
evidence   supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial
statements.   An  audit  also includes assessing the accounting  principles
used  and  significant estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating
the  overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our  audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our  opinion, the consolidated financial statements  referred  to
above  present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of
PepsiCo,  Inc.  and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and  December  25,
1993, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of  the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.

      As  discussed  in  Notes  14  and 13 to  the  consolidated  financial
statements,  PepsiCo, Inc. in 1994 adopted the provisions of the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board's Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards
No.  112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," and  changed
its  method for calculating the market-related value of pension plan assets
used  in  the determination of pension expense, respectively.  As discussed
in  Notes 12 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, PepsiCo, Inc.
in  1992  adopted  the  provisions  of the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board's  Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,  "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," respectively.

PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
___________________________________________________________________________

All share and per share amounts reflect three-for-one stock splits in 1990
and  1986.  Additionally, PepsiCo made numerous acquisitions in most  years
presented  and a few divestitures in certain years.  Such transactions  did
not  materially affect the comparability of PepsiCo's operating results for
the  periods presented, except for certain large acquisitions made in 1986,
1988 and 1989, and the divestitures discussed in Notes (g) and (j).

(a)  Included  the  current  year  benefit  of  changing  the  method   for
     calculating  the  market-related value of plan assets,  which  reduced
     full-year  pension  expense by $35.1 ($21.6  after-tax  or  $0.03  per
     share).  See Note 13.
(b)  Fiscal  years  1994  and 1988 each consisted of 53  weeks.   Normally,
     fiscal  years  consist of 52 weeks; however, because the  fiscal  year
     ends  on the last Saturday in December, a week is added every 5  or  6
     years.   The 53rd week increased 1994 earnings by approximately  $54.0
     ($34.9   after-tax   or  $0.04  per  share)  and  1988   earnings   by
     approximately $23.2 ($15.7 after-tax or $0.02 per share).
(c)  Included a $29.9 charge ($0.04 per share) to increase net deferred tax
     liabilities as of the beginning of 1993 for a 1% statutory income  tax
     rate increase due to 1993 U.S. tax legislation.  See Note 17.
(d)  Included $193.5 in unusual charges for restructuring ($128.5 after-tax
     or $0.16 per share).  See Note 2 on page F-9 and Note 16.
(e)  Included  $170.0  in unusual charges ($119.8 after-tax  or  $0.15  per
     share).  See Note 2 on page F-9.
(f)  Included  $83.0  in  unusual charges ($48.8  after-tax  or  $0.06  per
     share).  See Note 2 on page F-9.
(g)  Included a $156.0 unusual charge ($62.0 after-tax or $0.07 per  share)
     related   to   a  program  to  sell  several  international   bottling
     operations.
(h)  The $17.8 gain ($16.8 after-tax or $0.02 per share) in 1994 arose from
     a  public  share  offering by PepsiCo's BAESA joint venture  in  South
     America.   See Note 4.  The $118.2 gain ($53.0 after-tax or $0.07  per
     share) in 1990 arose from an initial public offering of new shares  by
     a KFC joint venture in Japan and a sale by PepsiCo of a portion of its
     shares.
(i)  Represents  the  cumulative  effect of  adopting  in  1994  SFAS  112,
     "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," and changing  the
     method for calculating the market-related value of plan assets used in
     determining  the  return-on-asset component of annual pension  expense
     and   the  cumulative  net  unrecognized  gain  or  loss  subject   to
     amortization (see Notes 14 and 13, respectively) and adopting in  1992
     SFAS  106,  "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits  Other
     Than Pensions," and SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Notes
     12  and  17, respectively).  Prior years were not restated  for  these
     changes in accounting.
(j)  Included  impacts of discontinued operations, the most significant  of
     which were in 1985 and 1984.  1985 included income of $123.6 after-tax
     ($0.15  per share) and 1984 included charges of $62.5 after-tax ($0.07
     per  share) resulting from PepsiCo disposing of its sporting goods and
     transportation segments.

(k)  Cash  flows from other investing and financing activities,  which  are
     not presented, are an integral part of total cash flow activity.
(l)  Total  debt  includes short-term borrowings and long-term debt,  which
     for 1987 through 1990 included a nonrecourse obligation.
(m)  The  return on average shareholders' equity is calculated using income
     from  continuing  operations before cumulative  effect  of  accounting
     changes.
(n)  The market net debt ratio represents net debt as a percent of net debt
     plus  the  market value of equity, based on the year-end stock  price.
     Net  debt  is total debt, which for this purpose includes the  present
     value  of  long-term operating lease commitments, reduced by  the  pro
     forma  remittance of investment portfolios held outside the U.S.   For
     1987  through  1990,  total debt was also reduced by  the  nonrecourse
     obligation in the calculation of net debt.
(o)  The historical cost net debt ratio represents net debt (see Note n) as
     a  percent of capital employed (net debt, other liabilities,  deferred
     income taxes and shareholders' equity).
