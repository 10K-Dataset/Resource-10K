 Proxy Statement for PepsiCo's              I, III
          May 7, 1997
Annual Meeting of Shareholders


                                    PART I
Item 1.    Business

      PepsiCo,  Inc. (the "Company") was  incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and
was  reincorporated  in North Carolina in 1986.  Unless the context  indicates
otherwise,  when used  herein the term  "PepsiCo"  shall mean the  Company and
its various  divisions and  subsidiaries.  PepsiCo is engaged in the following
businesses:  beverages,  snack foods and  restaurants.  In January,  1997, the
Company  announced  that it would  pursue  a plan to spin  off its  restaurant
businesses,  consisting  of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC, to  shareholders  as
an  independent  publicly  traded  company.  In 1996,  the Company  decided to
dispose of its non-core restaurant businesses.

Beverages

      PepsiCo's beverage business,  which operates as Pepsi-Cola  Company,  is
comprised  of two business  units:  Pepsi-Cola  North  America  ("PCNA"),  and
Pepsi-Cola Company International ("PCCI").

      PCNA  manufactures  and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks
and soft drink  concentrates,  in the United  States  and  Canada.  PCNA sells
its  concentrates  to  licensed  bottlers   ("Pepsi-Cola   bottlers").   Under
appointments from PepsiCo, bottlers manufacture,  sell and distribute,  within
defined  territories,  soft  drinks and  syrups  bearing  trademarks  owned by
PepsiCo,  including  PEPSI-COLA,  DIET PEPSI,  MOUNTAIN DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL
SPORT  and,  within  Canada,  7UP and DIET 7UP (the  foregoing  are  sometimes
referred to as "Pepsi-Cola  beverages").  The Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership,  a
joint  venture  of PCNA and  Lipton,  develops  and sells tea  concentrate  to
Pepsi-Cola  bottlers  and  develops  and markets  ready-to-drink  tea products
under the LIPTON  trademark.  Such  products  are  distributed  by  Pepsi-Cola
bottlers  throughout  the  United  States  and  Canada.   Pepsi-Cola  bottlers
distribute  single-serve  sizes of OCEAN SPRAY juice  products  throughout the
United States pursuant to a distribution  agreement.

      Pepsi-Cola  beverages  are  manufactured  in  approximately  175  plants
located   throughout   the   United   States   and   Canada.   PCNA   operates
approximately 65 plants,  and  manufactures,  sells and distributes  beverages
throughout   approximately   455   licensed   territories,    accounting   for
approximately  56% of the  Pepsi-Cola  beverages sold in the United States and
Canada.  Approximately  110 plants are  operated by  independent  licensees or
unconsolidated   affiliates,   which   manufacture,    sell   and   distribute
approximately  44% of the  Pepsi-Cola  beverages sold in the United States and
Canada.  PCNA has a  minority  interest  in 7 of these  licensees,  comprising
approximately 70  licensed territories.
 
      PCCI  manufactures  and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks
and soft drink  concentrates,  outside  the United  States  and  Canada.  PCCI
sells  its  concentrates  to  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers.  Under  appointments  from
PepsiCo,   bottlers   manufacture,   sell  and   distribute,   within  defined
territories,  beverages bearing  PEPSI-COLA,  7UP, MIRINDA,  DIET PEPSI, PEPSI
MAX,   MOUNTAIN   DEW,   DIET  7UP  and  other   trademarks.   PCCI   operates
approximately  30  plants  bottling  PepsiCo  beverage  products.   There  are
approximately    560   plants    operated   by   independent    licensees   or
unconsolidated   affiliates,   bottling  PepsiCo's  beverage  products.  These
products are  available in 191 countries  and  territories  outside the United
States  and  Canada.   Principal   international  markets  include  Argentina,
Brazil, China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
                                       



      PCNA and PCCI make  programs  available to assist  licensed  bottlers in
servicing markets,  expanding  operations and improving production methods and
facilities.   PCNA  and  PCCI  also  offer   assistance  to  bottlers  in  the
distribution,  advertising  and marketing of PepsiCo's  beverage  products and
offer  sales  assistance   through  special   merchandising   and  promotional
programs and by training  bottler  personnel.  PCNA and PCCI maintain  control
over the composition and quality of beverages sold under PepsiCo trademarks.

Snack Foods

      PepsiCo's snack food business,  which operates as The Frito-Lay Company,
is  comprised  of  Frito-Lay   North  America   ("Frito-Lay")   and  Frito-Lay
International ("FLI") (formerly known as PepsiCo Foods International).

      Frito-Lay  manufactures  and sells a varied  line of salty  snack  foods
throughout  the United  States and Canada,  including  LAY'S and RUFFLES brand
potato chips,  DORITOS and TOSTITOS  brand tortilla  chips,  FRITOS brand corn
chips,  CHEE.TOS brand cheese  flavored  snacks,  ROLD GOLD brand pretzels and
SUNCHIPS brand multigrain snacks.

      Frito-Lay's  products are transported from its  manufacturing  plants to
major distribution  centers,  principally by company-owned  trucks.  Frito-Lay
utilizes a  "store-door-delivery"  system,  whereby its  approximately  17,500
person  sales force  delivers  the snacks  directly to the store  shelf.  This
system  permits  Frito-Lay to work closely with  approximately  500,000 retail
trade  customers  weekly  and  to be  responsive  to  their  needs.  Frito-Lay
believes  this  form of  distribution  is a  valuable  marketing  tool  and is
essential for the proper distribution of products with a short shelf life.

      FLI's  products are available in 81 countries  outside the United States
and Canada through  company-owned  facilities and  unconsolidated  affiliates.
On most of the European  continent,  PepsiCo's snack food business consists of
Snack  Ventures  Europe,  a joint venture  between  PepsiCo and General Mills,
Inc.,  in which  PepsiCo  owns a 60%  interest.  FLI also  sells a variety  of
snack food  products  which  appeal to local  tastes  including,  for example,
WALKERS  snack  foods,  which  are sold in the  United  Kingdom,  WEDEL  sweet
snacks,  which  are sold in  Poland,  and  GAMESA  cookies  and  ALEGRO  sweet
snacks,  which are sold in Mexico. In addition,  RUFFLES,  CHEEoTOS,  DORITOS,
FRITOS and SUNCHIPS  salty snack foods have been  introduced to  international
markets.  Principal  international markets include Australia,  Brazil, France,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom.

      KFCNA is engaged principally in the operation, development,  franchising
and  licensing  of a system of  carryout  and  dine-in  restaurants  featuring
chicken  throughout  the United States and Canada,  operating  under the names

operation,  is responsible for the  consolidation of many restaurant  activities
and furnishes food,  supplies,  equipment and services to  approximately  16,000
company-operated,   franchised  and  licensed  PIZZA  HUT,  TACO  BELL  and  KFC
restaurants  in the United  States,  Canada,  Mexico and Poland.  On January 23,
1997, the Company announced that it is exploring the possible sale of PFS.

COMPETITION

     All of PepsiCo's businesses are highly competitive. PepsiCo's beverages and
snack  foods  compete  in the  United  States and  internationally  with  widely
distributed  products of a number of major companies that have plants in many of
the areas  PepsiCo  serves,  as well as with private label soft drinks and snack
foods and with the  products  of local  and  regional  manufacturers.  PepsiCo's
restaurants  compete  in  the  United  States  and  internationally  with  other
restaurants,  restaurant chains, food outlets and home delivery operations. PRSG
competes in the United States and  internationally  with other food distribution
companies. For all of PepsiCo's industry segments, the main areas of competition
are price, quality and variety of products, and customer service.

EMPLOYEES

     At December 28, 1996,  PepsiCo  employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,
approximately   486,000  persons  (including   approximately  260,000  part-time
employees),  of whom  approximately  335,000  (including  approximately  200,000
part-time  employees) were employed within the United States.  PepsiCo  believes
that its relations with employees are generally good.

RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER SUPPLIES

     The principal  materials  used by PepsiCo in its  beverage,  snack food and
restaurant  businesses  are  corn  sweeteners,  sugar,  aspartame,   flavorings,
vegetable and essential oils,  potatoes,  corn,  flour,  tomato products,  pinto
beans, lettuce, cheese, butter, beef, pork and chicken products,  seasonings and
packaging materials.  Since PepsiCo relies on trucks to move and distribute many
of  its  products,  fuel  is  also  an  important  commodity.   PepsiCo  employs
specialists  to  secure  adequate  supplies  of many of these  items and has not
experienced any  significant  continuous  shortages.  Prices paid by PepsiCo for
such items are subject to fluctuation.  When prices increase, PepsiCo may or may
not pass on such increases to its customers. Generally, when PepsiCo has decided
to pass  along  price  increases,  it has  done  so  successfully.  There  is no
assurance that PepsiCo will be able to do so in the future.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

     The conduct of PepsiCo's businesses,  and the production,  distribution and
use of many of its products,  are subject to various  federal laws,  such as the
Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act, the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act and the
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act. The conduct of PepsiCo's  businesses is also
subject to state, local and foreign laws.



PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES

      PepsiCo  owns  numerous  valuable  trademarks  which  are  essential  to
PepsiCo's  worldwide  businesses,  including  PEPSI-COLA,  PEPSI,  DIET PEPSI,
PEPSI MAX,  MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL SPORT,  7UP and DIET 7UP (outside
the United States), MIRINDA,  FRITO-LAY,  LAY'S, DORITOS,  RUFFLES,  TOSTITOS,
FRITOS,  CHEE.TOS,  ROLD  GOLD,  SUNCHIPS,  SANTITAS,   SMARTFOOD,   SABRITAS,
WALKERS,  PIZZA HUT, TACO BELL,  KENTUCKY  FRIED  CHICKEN and KFC.  Trademarks
remain valid so long as they are used  properly for  identification  purposes,
and  PepsiCo   emphasizes   correct  use  of  its   trademarks.   PepsiCo  has
authorized  (through  licensing or franchise  arrangements) the use of many of
its  trademarks in such contexts as Pepsi-Cola  bottling  appointments,  snack
food joint ventures and  wholly-owned  operations and Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
KFC  franchise  agreements.  In  addition,  PepsiCo  licenses  the  use of its
trademarks on collateral  products for the primary  purpose of enhancing brand
awareness.

      PepsiCo  either owns or has  licenses  to use a number of patents  which
relate to certain of its products and the processes for their  production  and
to the  design and  operation  of various  equipment  used in its  businesses.
Some of these patents are licensed to others.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

      PepsiCo expensed $115 million,  $96 million and $152 million on research
and development activities in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      PepsiCo  continues to make expenditures in order to comply with federal,
state,   local  and  foreign   environmental   laws  and  regulations,   which
expenditures  have  not  been  material  with  respect  to  PepsiCo's  capital
expenditures, net income or competitive position.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

      Information as to net sales,  operating profits and identifiable  assets
for  each of  PepsiCo's  industry  segments  and  major  geographic  areas  of
operations,  as well as capital  spending,  acquisitions  and  investments  in
unconsolidated    affiliates,    amortization   of   intangible   assets   and
depreciation  expense for each  industry  segment  for 1996,  1995 and 1994 is
contained in Item 8 "Financial  Statements and Supplementary  Data" in Note 19
on page F-30.

leases  approximately  6,900  restaurants,  delivery/carryout  units  and  other
outlets in the United States and Canada,  and owns  approximately 900 and leases
approximately 1,000 additional units outside the United States and Canada. PIZZA
HUT, TACO BELL and KFC  restaurants in the United States which are not owned are
generally leased for initial terms of 15 or 20 years, and generally have renewal
options, while PIZZA HUT delivery/carryout  units in the United States generally
are leased for significantly shorter initial terms with shorter renewal options.

      PepsiCo  is  subject to  various  claims  and  contingencies  related to
lawsuits,  taxes,  environmental  and other matters  arising out of the normal
course of  business.  Management  believes  that the  ultimate  liability,  if

material   adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of  operations  or
financial condition.

Item 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS
       AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION
Management's  Analysis  is  presented  in four  sections.  The  first  section
provides  introductory  comments,  highlights items that significantly  impact
comparability   of  reported   financial   information   and   provides   some
perspective  of our  operations  outside of the United  States  (pages  10-13).
The  second  section   analyzes  the  results  of   operations,   first  on  a
consolidated  basis and then for each of our three  industry  segments  (pages
13-31).  The  final two  sections  address  our  consolidated  cash  flows and
financial  condition,  which also includes our  Cautionary  Statements  (pages
31-36).



      As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  we had
a two-for-one  stock split in 1996.  All share data in  Management's  Analysis
have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

CHANGE IN SEGMENT REPORTING
Beginning  in the fourth  quarter of 1996,  we changed the  segment  reporting
which  supports  our  Management's  Analysis  to more  closely  reflect how we
manage the  business.  As a result,  our  beverages  and snack foods  segments
are now reported on a North American  basis (U.S. and Canada  combined) and an
International  basis (all other  international)  while the restaurants segment
continues  to be reported on a U.S. and  international  basis.  Also,  the net
sales and operating  profit we report  externally now generally  match the net
sales  and  operating   profit  our  operating  units  report  to  our  senior
management.  The operating  profit  reported on this  "Management  Basis" does
not reflect items the operating  units are not held  accountable  for, such as
the  $520  million   initial   impact  of  adopting   Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of
Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of", in 1995 (see
Note 4). It also does not  reflect  insignificant  allocations  for  corporate
items  directly   attributable   to  the  segments  or  exclude  results  from
unconsolidated  affiliates,  both  of  which  are  required  by  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 14 (SFAS 14),  "Financial  Reporting for
Segments of a Business  Enterprise."  The Management  Basis  operating  profit
(page  19)  includes  a  reconciliation  to the  operating  profit  disclosure
required  by SFAS 14,  which is provided  in Note 19.  Prior year  amounts and
related management's analysis have been restated.

CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY
The  following  table  summarizes  items  impacting  comparability,  which are
described  in Notes 2, 13 and 15. We believe  the items  included in the first
section are so unusual  and  distortive  that we do not  include  them when we
evaluate the ongoing performances of our businesses.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES
Excluding  the  $576  million  of  unusual  impairment,   disposal  and  other
charges,   ongoing  international  operating  profit  (including  Canada),  as
measured  on  the  Management  Basis,  represented  10%,  24%  and  20% of our
consolidated  operating  profit  in 1996,  1995 and  1994,  respectively.  The
decline  in  1996  reflected  an  operating  loss in  International  beverages
compared  to an  operating  profit in 1995.  The 4% growth in 1995 was  slowed
by Mexico,  formerly our largest  international market, where the Mexican peso
devalued  approximately  50% in late  1994 and  early  1995.  Consumer  demand
declined  dramatically  in  response  to  declining  real  incomes,  increased
unemployment and price increases taken to offset rising costs.

Our efforts to  stimulate  demand,  reduce costs and reduce  capital  spending
resulted in only a modest  decline in peso  operating  profit.  However,  on a
U.S.  dollar  basis,  1995  sales,  income and  identifiable  assets in Mexico
declined  dramatically,  reflecting the unfavorable  translation effect of the
much weaker peso, as summarized below:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worldwide  net sales rose $1.4  billion in 1996  reflecting  higher  effective
net  pricing  (including  the effect of product,  package and country  mix) in
each of our three  business  




segments and net volume gains of $592 million.  The higher effective net pricing
was  partially  offset  by an  unfavorable  foreign  currency  exchange  impact,
primarily  reflecting the weaker peso and the  strengthening  of the U.S. dollar
compared to the Japanese  yen.  The volume gains were driven by worldwide  snack
foods  and North  American  beverages,  partially  offset  by  declines  at U.S.
restaurants.  The sales  growth  rate was  reduced by 1 point as we reduced  our
ownership  of  the   restaurant   system  through   refranchising   and  closing
underperforming restaurants, as described in Management's Analysis - Restaurants
beginning on page 26.
     Worldwide net sales rose $1.9 billion or 7% in 1995. The  fifty-third  week
in 1994 reduced worldwide net sales growth by approximately 2 points. The growth
benefited from higher effective net pricing in International snack foods, driven
by Mexico,  and in North  American  beverages,  primarily to help offset  higher
prices for packaging.  These benefits were partially  offset by the  unfavorable
currency  translation  impact of the weaker peso on  International  snack foods.
Volume gains in worldwide  snack foods and  beverages  added $934 million to net
sales. Additional restaurant units contributed $623 million to sales growth.

Cost of sales            $15,383         $14,886        $13,715
As a percent of net sales   48.6%           49.2%          48.4%          
                            
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost of  sales  as a  percent  of net  sales  decreased  .6 of a  point  in 1996
primarily due to lower raw materials costs in North American  beverages  coupled
with the leveraging effect of the higher effective net pricing.
     The .8 of a point  increase  in cost of sales as a percent  of net sales in
1995 was primarily due to higher packaging  prices in North American  beverages,
the effect of which was partially  mitigated by increased effective net pricing,
and an unfavorable mix shift in International beverages sales from higher-margin
concentrate to lower-margin packaged products. Cost of sales as a percent of net
sales in  International  snack  foods  increased  due to  inflation-driven  cost
increases in Mexico, which were partially mitigated by price increases.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)

   sales                39.8%        38.2%         39.2%           
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SG&A  comprises  selling  and  distribution  expenses  (S&D),   advertising  and
marketing  expenses (A&M),  general and  administrative  expenses  (G&A),  other
income and expense and equity income or loss from investments in  unconsolidated
affiliates. In 1996, A&M,



S&D and G&A all grew faster than net sales driving a 9% increase in SG&A, led by
International  beverages.  Other income and expense included refranchising gains
in excess of the costs of closing other restaurants (net refranchising gains) of
$99  million,  compared  to $55  million in 1995.  In  addition,  1996  included
recurring  SFAS  121  noncash  impairment  charges  of $62  million  related  to
restaurants.  Losses from our unconsolidated affiliates,  compared to earnings a
year ago,  primarily  reflected our share of operating  losses from Buenos Aires
Embotelladora S.A. (BAESA). BAESA is one of our bottling joint ventures in Latin
America.
     In 1995,  SG&A grew 4% due to A&M, S&D and G&A all growing at a slower rate
than sales.  The slower  spending  was driven by  worldwide  beverages  and U.S.
restaurants.  G&A in  worldwide  beverages  benefited  from  International  cost
containment  initiatives,  savings  in  North  American  beverages  from  a 1994
reorganization  and leverage from the  increased  effective net pricing in North
American  beverages.  Other income benefited from net refranchising gains of $55
million,  compared to store  closure  costs of $10 million in 1994 and a gain on
the sale of an International bottling plant in 1995.

AMORTIZATION  OF  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  declined  5% in 1996 to $301  million as a
result of the reduced  carrying  amount of intangible  assets in connection with
the 1995  adoption of SFAS 121 (see Note 4), but increased 1% to $316 million in
1995.  This  noncash  expense  reduced net income per share by $0.14 in 1996 and
$0.15 in 1995.

UNUSUAL  IMPAIRMENT,  DISPOSAL AND OTHER  CHARGES of $822 million  ($716 million
after-tax  or $0.45  per  share)  in 1996  were  associated  with  International
beverages  ($576  million)  and the  decision  to dispose of our  non-core  U.S.
restaurant businesses ($246 million). See Note 3.
     The 1995 charge of $520 million ($384 million after-tax or $0.24 per share)
was the initial,  noncash  impairment charge upon adoption of SFAS 121. See Note
4.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     In 1996, reported operating profit declined $441 million. Ongoing operating
profit  decreased $139 million,  primarily due to a combined  segment  operating
profit decrease of $95 million or 3%. The decline  reflected  increased costs in
excess of higher  effective  net pricing in  International  beverages  and North
American snack foods and unfavorable  currency  translation  impacts,  partially
offset by the $177  million  of  volume  gains.  Also  included  in the  segment
operating profit results were reduced  depreciation and amortization  expense of
$46 million as a result of the reduced  carrying  amount of assets in connection
with the  adoption of SFAS 121,  and $99 million of net  refranchising  gains in
1996 compared to $55 million in 1995, partially offset by the recurring SFAS 121
noncash  impairment  charge of $62  million in 1996.  Ongoing  operating  profit
growth was also hampered by increased net corporate costs.
     In 1995, reported operating profit declined $214 million. Ongoing operating
profit  increased $306 million or 10%. The fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the
operating profit growth by approximately 2 points.  The profit growth was driven
by  combined  segment  operating  profit  growth of $283  million  or 8%,  which
reflected  volume growth of $283 million  ($430 million  excluding the impact of
the fifty-third  week) and $76 million due to net additional  restaurant  units.
These advances were partially  offset by net  unfavorable  currency  translation
impacts,  primarily  related to the peso.  The benefit of higher  effective  net
pricing  for all  segments  combined  was almost  entirely  offset by  increased
product and operating costs, primarily in Mexico, and higher packaging prices in
North American beverages. Ongoing operating profit growth benefited from reduced
net corporate costs.

GAIN ON STOCK  OFFERING  BY AN  UNCONSOLIDATED  AFFILIATE  of $18  million  ($17

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our 1996  reported  effective tax rate  increased 9.9 points to 43.9%,  driven
by the low tax benefits associated with the unusual  impairment,  disposal and
other  charges.  Our 1996 ongoing  effective tax rate  increased 2.4 points to
35.0%,  primarily  reflecting  lower  benefits in 1996 from the  current  year
resolution  of certain  prior years audit issues and a decline in  lower-taxed
foreign  income  coupled  with an  increase  in  foreign  losses  with low tax
benefits.

      Our 1995  reported  effective tax rate  increased 1 point to 34.0%.  Our
1995 ongoing effective tax rate declined  slightly,  reflecting  benefits from
the  current  year  resolution  of certain  prior years  audit  issues.  These
benefits  were  partially  offset  by a higher  foreign  effective  tax  rate,
primarily  due to a provision in 1993 U.S. tax  legislation  and a decrease in
the  proportion  of  income  taxed at lower  foreign  rates.  The  legislation
limited  the U.S.  tax 





credit on income we earned in Puerto Rico to 60% of the amount allowed under the
previous tax law beginning on December 1, 1994. The legislation  further reduces
the limit ratably over the following four years to 40%. This  provision  reduced
our 1995 earnings by $58 million or $0.04 per share.

___________________________________________________________________________
[Note:  Unless otherwise  noted,  net sales and operating  profit  comparisons
within the following  discussions  are based on ongoing  operating  profit and
include the impact of the fifty-third week in 1994 (see Notes 2 and 19).]

System  bottler  case sales (BCS) of Pepsi  Corporate  brands is our  standard
volume  measure.  It  represents  company-owned  brands  as well as  brands we
have the right to produce,  distribute  and market  nationally,  and  includes
sales  of  packaged   products  and  fountain  syrup  by   company-owned   and
franchised  bottlers.  BCS was not  impacted by the  fifty-third  week in 1994
because it is measured on a calendar year basis.

                                1996 vs. 1995
North America
- -------------
Sales in North America rose $325  million.  The gain  reflected  volume growth
of $215  million,  led by  carbonated  soft drink (CSD)  products,  and higher
effective net pricing.
      North  American BCS  increased  4%, with solid  increases in Brand Pepsi
and the Mountain Dew brand.  Alternative  beverages,  led by Aquafina  bottled
water and Hawaiian Punch fountain syrup, grew at a double-digit rate.



     Profit in North America increased $179 million. The growth reflected volume
gains of $117 million, lower product costs and the higher effective net pricing.
Advertising  and  marketing  expenses  grew  significantly  faster  than  sales,
primarily due to the Pepsi Stuff  promotion.  Selling and  distribution  expense
grew at the same rate as sales and  volume.  Profit  growth was aided by lapping
charges  taken in 1995,  primarily for losses on supply  contracts,  take-or-pay
co-packing  penalties and a write-down of excess co-packing  assets. A 1996 gain
on the sale of an investment  in a bottling  cooperative  and a 1996  settlement
with a supplier for purchases made in prior years also helped profit growth.
     Benefits  of   approximately   $130  million   related  to  the  1992  U.S.
restructuring  were achieved in 1996 due to the centralization of purchasing and
improved  administrative and business  processes.  Benefits are expected to grow
until fully  realized in 1998,  when they are  expected to be about $145 million
annually.  All benefits from the restructuring will continue to be reinvested in
the business to strengthen our competitive position.

International
- -------------
Our new  strategy for  International  beverages is to focus on building our core
business in markets in which we are already strong and in emerging markets where
we believe the competitive  playing field is essentially  level. As a result, we
took a  restructuring  charge of $122  million,  which is  described  in Note 3.
Almost  all of the  charge  is  expected  to be  paid by the  end of  1997.  The
restructuring  is expected to generate about $50 million in savings in 1997, and
about $80 million a year thereafter. See Cautionary Statements beginning on page
35. In addition, a largely noncash charge of $454 million was recognized in 1996
related to the impairment of certain  investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates
($216 million), concentrate-related assets ($129 million), assets not related to
the core  International  beverage  business  ($69  million) and our share of the
unusual  charges  recorded  by  BAESA  for  restructuring  actions  and  noncash
accounting charges ($40 million).
     International  sales  declined $183 million,  primarily due to  unfavorable
currency translation impacts and lower volume of $41 million. The volume decline
reflected lower concentrate shipments to franchisees, partially offset by higher
packaged product sales to retailers.
     International  BCS decreased 2%. Excluding the fourth quarter impact of the
unexpected  loss of our  Venezuelan  bottler in August 1996,  BCS declined 1%. A
single-digit   decline  in  Latin  America  was   partially   offset  by  strong
double-digit growth in China and India.
     International  beverages  reported  operating  losses of $846  million or a
decline of $963 million. Excluding the unusual charges,  International beverages
reported an ongoing operating loss of $270 million or a decline of $387 million.
The ongoing  operating loss reflected  broad-based  increases in advertising and
marketing  expenses,  higher-than-normal  expenses from fourth  quarter  balance
sheet  adjustments  and actions,  increased  net losses from our  unconsolidated
affiliates  and a volume  decline of $41 million.  The increased net losses from
our  unconsolidated  affiliates  was driven by our 24%  equity  share of BAESA's
operating losses.




                                1995 vs. 1994

North America
- -------------
Sales in North  America  rose $369  million  or 5%.  The  fifty-third  week in
1994  reduced the sales  growth by  approximately  2 points.  The sales growth
reflected  higher  effective  net pricing on most CSD  packages,  primarily in
response  to  significantly   higher  packaging  prices.   Sales  growth  also
benefited from increased volume, which contributed $92 million.
      North American BCS increased 4%, reflecting  double-digit  growth in the
Mountain Dew brand,  solid  increases  in Brand Pepsi and strong  double-digit
growth in  alternative  beverages,  led by Lipton  brand tea and the All Sport
brand.
      North American  profit  increased  $134 million or 12%. The  fifty-third
week in 1994 reduced the operating  profit growth by  approximately  2 points.
Profit growth  reflected the higher  effective net pricing on CSD packages and
concentrate  which  exceeded the  increased  packaging  costs.  Volume  gains,
driven by packaged  products,  contributed $46 million ($104 million excluding
the  impact of the  fifty-third  week) to the  profit  growth.  Administrative
expenses   declined,   reflecting   savings  from  a  1994   consolidation  of
headquarters  and  field  operations  in the  U.S.  Selling  and  distribution
expenses  declined  as a  percentage  of  sales,  in  part  reflecting  higher
pricing.   Advertising  and  marketing   expenses   decreased,   reflecting  a
reallocation  of  funds  to  support  promotional  discounts  in the  fountain
channel,  which is  classified  as a  reduction  of sales.  In the  aggregate,
advertising  and  marketing  expenses  and fountain  discounts  was about even
with the prior year.
      In 1995, North America  continued to execute actions related to the 1992
U.S.  restructuring.  Benefits  in  1995  were  offset  by  incremental  costs
associated  with  the  continued   development  and   implementation   of  the
restructuring.  Net benefits of  approximately  $130 million were  expected to
begin to be  realized in 1996 and to increase  annually  until fully  realized
in 1998.

International
- -------------
International  sales rose $447  million or 18%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced  the  sales  growth by  approximately  1 point.  Start-up  operations,
principally in Eastern  Europe,  and net  acquisitions,  primarily of bottling
operations  in Asia,  together  contributed  5  points  to the  sales  growth.
Sales growth also  benefited  from volume  advances of $205 million and higher
effective net pricing.
      International  BCS grew 8%. This advance  reflected  broad-based  growth
partially  offset  by  declines  in  Mexico,  our  largest  International  BCS
market, and Argentina, both of which had adverse economic conditions.
      International  beverages  reported a profit  decrease  of $19 million or
14%.  Ongoing  operating  profit  declined  $1 million or 1%. The  fifty-third
week in 1994 reduced the ongoing  operating  profit decline by approximately 2
points.  The slight decline in ongoing  operating profit  primarily  reflected
significantly  weaker results in Mexico (discussed  below).  Excluding Mexico,
ongoing  operating profit increased $64 million or 44%,  reflecting  increased
volume,  primarily  concentrate,  of $58 million and the higher  effective net
pricing,  partially  offset  by higher  field  operating  costs and  increased
headquarters  expenses.  Profit  was  also  aided  by a gain on the  sale of a
bottling plant.



     As discussed in Management's  Analysis -  International  Businesses on page
13, results in Mexico were adversely impacted by economic difficulties resulting
from the significant  devaluation of the peso. Net sales in Mexico declined 37%,
while 1995 operating results declined to a $27 million operating loss, including
losses of $12 million from unconsolidated affiliates formed in 1995, compared to
a $38 million operating profit in 1994.

                                1996 vs. 1995
North America
- -------------
     Sales in North  America grew $755  million.  The sales  increase  reflected
strong volume growth of $495 million and higher effective net pricing across all
core  brands in late 1995 and late 1996.  Volume  grew in almost all core brands
with low-fat and no-fat snacks accounting for over 45% of the sales growth.
     Pound  volume  in  North  America  advanced  9%,   reflecting   exceptional
performance from the low-fat and no-fat categories. These categories contributed
over 45% of the total pound growth, led by Baked Lay's brand potato crisps. Core
brands, excluding their low-fat and no-fat versions, had mid-single-digit growth
led by double-digit  growth in Lay's brand potato chips and strong  double-digit
growth in Tostitos brand tortilla chips.
     Profit in North America grew $137 million.  The profit  increase  reflected
the volume growth,  which contributed $224 million, and the higher effective net
pricing, which exceeded increased promotional price allowances and merchandising
support. The growth rate of promotional price allowances moderated in the fourth
quarter. These gains were partially offset by higher operating and manufacturing
costs and  increased  administrative  expenses.  The increased  operating  costs
reflected increased selling and distribution and advertising  expenses.  Selling
and distribution expenses and manufacturing costs both reflected higher capacity
costs and some  inefficiencies  incurred  to capture  the  volume  opportunities
created  when  Anheuser-Busch  exited  the  salty  snack  food  business.  These
inefficiencies began to moderate in the fourth quarter.  Operating expenses grew
faster than sales for the year. The


increase in  operating  expenses  coupled with higher  administrative  expenses,
partially  reflected  investment  spending to sustain strong volume growth. This
increased  investment  spending,  including  costs of developing and testing new
products, was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non-core business.

International
- -------------
International  sales  increased  $380  million.  The  sales  increase  reflected
inflation-based  pricing  increases in Mexico and volume growth of $157 million,
partially offset by an unfavorable currency translation impact, led by the peso.
     International kilo growth is reported on a systemwide basis, which includes
both  consolidated  businesses and  unconsolidated  affiliates  operating for at
least one year.  Salty snack kilos rose 8%,  reflecting  double-digit  growth at
Sabritas in Mexico and strong  single-digit  growth by Walkers in the U.K.,  our
two largest  salty snack  businesses.  Sweet snack kilos  declined  2%, led by a
single-digit  decline at Gamesa in Mexico, due to market-wide  contraction and a
double-digit decline at Alegro, the sweet snack division of Sabritas.
     International   operating  profit  increased  $45  million.   The  increase
reflected  higher effective net pricing in advance of  inflation-driven  product
and operating cost increases,  primarily in Mexico, and the increased volumes of
$28  million.  These gains were  partially  offset by  increased  administrative
expenses and the net unfavorable  currency  translation impact.  Advertising and
marketing  expenses  increased,   partially  reflecting   investment  in  global
advertising and design.
     Beginning in 1997, we will categorize  Mexico as highly  inflationary  and,
therefore,  the U.S. dollar will be the functional currency.  Although difficult
to  estimate,  we expect the 1997  reported  results of our  Sabritas and Gamesa
operations  to be slightly  lower than what they would have been had we retained
the peso as our functional currency. See Cautionary Statements beginning on page
35.

                                1995 vs. 1994
North America
- -------------
Sales in North  America  grew $507 million or 9%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the sales  growth by  approximately  2 points.  The  increase  reflected
volume growth of $427 million and higher pricing across all core brands.  Volume
grew in almost all core brands,  with low-fat and no-fat snacks  accounting  for
almost 45% of the total sales growth.
     Pound  volume  in  North  America  advanced  11%,  reflecting   exceptional
performance from the low-fat and no-fat categories. These categories contributed
almost 45% of the total pound growth,  led by Rold Gold brand pretzels and Baked
Tostitos brand tortilla chips.  Core brands,  excluding their low-fat and no-fat
versions, had solid single-digit growth, led by Doritos brand tortilla chips and
Lay's brand potato chips.
     Profit in North America grew $106 million or 10%. The  fifty-third  week in
1994 reduced the profit growth by  approximately  3 points.  The profit increase
reflected  strong volume growth,  which  contributed  $196 million ($247 million
excluding the impact of the fifty-third  week), and higher pricing that exceeded
increased  promotional price allowances and merchandising  support.  This growth
was partially  offset by increased  operating  costs,  driven by higher selling,
distribution and administrative  expenses and increased marketing  investment to
promote strong volume momentum.  Selling and distribution expenses grew at about
the same rate as sales,  while  advertising and marketing costs grew slower than
sales.  The higher  administrative  expenses  reflected  investment  spending to
maintain volume



growth,  including new manufacturing and delivery systems. The profit growth was
also hampered by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting increased capacity costs
and an unfavorable sales mix shift to lower-margin value-oriented packages.

International
- -------------
As discussed in  Management's  Analysis -  International  Businesses on page 13,
1995  results  in  Mexico  were  adversely  impacted  by  economic  difficulties
resulting  from  the  significant  devaluation  of the  peso.  This  effect  was
particularly dramatic on International snack foods results as Mexico represented
almost 75% of its 1994  operating  profit.  Net sales in Mexico  declined 39% in
1995, while operating profit declined $113 million or 44% to $142 million.  As a
result,  Mexico represented about half of 1995 International snack foods profit.
Since  the  change  in  results  of  Mexico  had  such a  distortive  effect  on
International  results, the following net sales and operating profit discussions
exclude the effects of Mexico where noted.
     International  sales decreased $226 million or 8%. Excluding Mexico,  sales
grew more than 35%;  the  fifty-third  week in 1994  reduced the sales growth by
approximately 3 points. This growth reflected increased volumes of $272 million,
a favorable mix shift to higher-priced  packages and products and  acquisitions,
which contributed $43 million.
     Salty snack kilos rose 10%, reflecting strong double-digit volume growth in
Brazil,  the U.K. and our joint  ventures in the  Netherlands  and Spain.  Sweet
snack kilos grew 12%, led by a double-digit advance at Gamesa.
     International  operating profit decreased $53 million. The fifty-third week
in 1994 had no effect on operating  profit.  The principal cause of the decrease
in operating profit was the economic  difficulties in Mexico.  Excluding Mexico,
operating  profit  increased  $58 million or 58%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced this profit growth by  approximately 2 points.  Profit growth  reflected
the  favorable  mix shift to  higher-priced  packages and products and increased
volumes  of $45  million,  partially  offset by higher  manufacturing  costs and
increased administrative expenses.


RESTAURANTS
- -----------
An update to our  restaurant  strategy  is  provided  to set the  context of the
operating results discussion beginning on page 29.

STRATEGY UPDATE
- ---------------
In January 1997,  we announced  that we would pursue a plan to spin off our core
restaurant  businesses to our  shareholders  as an  independent  publicly-traded
company. The new company will include both the U.S. and international operations
of Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC. We are exploring  the  possibility  of selling
PepsiCo Food Systems (PFS), our restaurant  distribution operation. In the first
quarter of 1996,  we  recorded a $26  million  charge  related to a decision  to
dispose of Hot 'n Now (HNN). In the fourth quarter,  we recognized an impairment
loss of $220 million as a result of our decision to sell our remaining  non-core
U.S. restaurant businesses which include California Pizza Kitchen (CPK), Chevys,
D'Angelo  Sandwich Shops  (D'Angelo) and East Side Mario's (ESM). We reduced our
investments in these  businesses to estimated  fair market value,  less costs to
sell.  Estimated  fair market value was based  primarily  upon the opinion of an
investment banking firm. See Notes 3 and 4 and Cautionary  Statements  beginning
on page 35.



      In addition,  we will  continue to execute the strategy we initiated two
years ago to reduce our percentage  ownership in our restaurant  businesses by
selling  company-operated   restaurants  to  franchisees  (refranchising)  and
closing  underperforming  units. Although this refranchising  strategy reduces
reported  sales,  it improves  restaurants  returns and profit by  eliminating
capital  investment  in stores while  generating a franchise  royalty  revenue
stream  which,  in some  cases,  exceeds  the  profit we had  earned  from the
stores  prior  to  refranchising.   In  addition,  margins  benefit  from  the
closing  of  underperforming   stores  in  the   company-operated   portfolio.
Operating  profit  and cash  flows  benefit  from the  one-time  refranchising
gains  (including  initial  franchise  fees).  Our  restaurant  companies have
usually remained  contingently  liable for restaurant  leases assigned as part
of the  refranchising  activity;  however,  we believe  any risk of loss under
these assignments would not be material.

      As a result  of the  unit  activity,  coupled  with  net new  points  of

percentage  of total  system units  declined 4 points to 45% at year-end  1996

[Note:  Net  sales and  operating  profit  comparisons  within  the  following
discussions  include the impact of the  fifty-third  week in 1994 (see Notes 2
and 19),  while  same store  sales  growth has been  adjusted  to exclude  its
impact.]

                                1996 vs. 1995
U.S.
- ----
Net sales  decreased $96 million.  The decrease was driven by volume  declines
of  $286  million,   partially   due  to  lapping  the  second   quarter  1995
introduction  of Stuffed  Crust  pizza,  and the  unfavorable  impact of fewer
company  units of $272  million.  These  declines  were  partially  offset  by
higher  effective net pricing and the  consolidation  of CPK at the end of the
second  quarter of 1996.  Same store  sales  decreased  4% and 2% at Pizza Hut
and Taco Bell,  respectively,  reflecting fewer transaction counts. KFC's same
store sales  increased 6% due  primarily to the impact of new products such as
Tender Roast Chicken, Colonel's Crispy Strips and Chunky Chicken Pot Pies.
      Reported  operating  profit  declined  $356 million.  Ongoing  operating
profit  decreased  $110 million  because of higher store  operating  costs,  a
volume  decrease of $166 million and  recurring  noncash  SFAS 121  impairment
charges  of  $54  million.   The  higher  store   operating   costs  reflected
increased labor and food costs,  partially offset by reduced  depreciation and
amortization  expense of $30 million in  connection  with the adoption of SFAS
121.  The above  effects were  partially  offset by the higher  effective  net
pricing  which  exceeded the 



increased store operating costs, and by a net refranchising  gain of $89 million
in 1996 compared to $63 million in 1995.

INTERNATIONAL
- -------------
International  sales increased $209 million,  driven by the favorable  impact of
net additional  company units of $112 million,  higher effective net pricing and
increased volumes, which contributed $52 million.
     Operating profit increased $41 million, reflecting the higher effective net
pricing,  a net  refranchising  gain in 1996 of $10  million  compared  to a net
refranchising  loss in 1995 of $8 million,  $18  million  due to net  additional
company  units  and  increased  volumes  of $15  million.  These  benefits  were
partially offset by higher store operating costs,  increased  administrative and
support costs and an $8 million  recurring  noncash SFAS 121 impairment  charge.
The higher  store  operating  costs,  which  exceeded the higher  effective  net
pricing,  primarily  reflected  increased food prices and higher labor costs and
advertising  expenses.  These  increased  store  operating  costs were partially
offset by  reduced  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  of $10  million in
connection  with the adoption of SFAS 121. The profit growth also benefited from
increased equity income.

     Net sales  increased  $510  million  or 6%.  The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the sales growth by  approximately 1 point.  The sales growth  reflected
$378 million from net additional company units and higher effective net pricing,
partially offset by $52 million of volume  declines.  Same store sales increased
4% and 7% at Pizza  Hut and KFC,  respectively,  driven  by new  products.  Taco
Bell's same store sales declined 4% due to fewer transaction counts.
     Operating  profit grew $89  million or 14%.  The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the profit growth by  approximately 5 points.  The growth included a net
refranchising  gain of $63  million  in 1995  as  well  as $12  million  for the
write-off of costs associated with sites that will not be developed (undeveloped
sites).  This  compared to $10 million of store  closure costs and $6 million of
undeveloped  site  costs  in  1994.  Profit  growth  was  also  aided by the net
additional company units, which contributed $54 million,  and lower depreciation
and amortization  expense of $11 million in connection with the adoption of SFAS
121. These  benefits were  partially  offset by the lower volumes of $27 million
($24  million  excluding  the  impact of the  fifty-third  week)  and  increased
overhead  costs,  primarily  due to a $17  million  charge in 1995 to move Pizza
Hut's U.S. headquarters from Wichita to Dallas.

INTERNATIONAL
- -------------
International  net sales increased $297 million or 16%. The fifty-third  week in
1994  reduced the sales growth by  approximately  2 points.  The sales  increase
primarily reflected  additional units of $244 million.  International  operating
profit  increased $26 million or 30%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the
operating  profit growth rate by  approximately 5 points.  The increased  profit
reflected  higher  effective net pricing and net  additional  company units that
contributed



$22 million. It also reflected reduced  depreciation and amortization expense of
$6  million  as a result of the 1995  adoption  of SFAS 121.  These  gains  were
partially offset by higher store operating costs,  increased  administrative and
support costs and a $17 million  reduction in volume ($14 million  excluding the
impact of the fifty-third  week).  Profit growth was also hampered by $8 million
of net refranchising losses in 1995 and equity losses in 1995 compared to equity
earnings in 1994.


CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS
- -----------------------

Consolidated  cash flows in 1996  reflected  strong  cash  flows from  operating
activities of $4.2 billion,  cash from restaurant  refranchising of $355 million
and cash from stock option  exercises of $323 million.  The cash funded  capital
spending  of $2.3  billion,  share  repurchases  of $1.7  billion  and  dividend
payments of $675  million.  Debt  payments of $801  million  were  substantially
funded by short-term investment proceeds of $775 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES increased $452 million or 12% to $4.2
billion in 1996 due primarily to operating  working capital cash inflows of $179
million in 1996  compared  to net cash  outflows  of $411  million in 1995.  The
change in operating working capital cash flows primarily reflected slower growth
in accounts and notes  receivable  in 1996  compared to 1995,  higher  growth in
accounts payable and other current liabilities and slower growth in inventories.
The slower  growth in accounts  and notes  receivable  reflected  lower sales by
International  beverages  and a sale of $134  million  of  U.S.  trade  accounts
receivable in 1996 to take advantage of favorable effective financing rates. The
growth in accounts payable and other current liabilities was driven primarily by
accruals  related to the 1996 unusual charges and timing of payments,  partially
offset by the impact of our accounts  payable amount remaining about the same as
1995. These cash flow favorabilities were



partially offset by the tax-related decision to stop prefunding certain employee
benefits at the end of 1995.

     Net cash  provided by operating  activities  in 1995 rose $26 million or 1%
over 1994 to $3.7 billion,  primarily  reflecting improved income before noncash
charges and credits  largely offset by the effect of operating  working  capital
cash outflows of $411 million in 1995 compared to cash inflows of $31 million in
1994.

NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING  ACTIVITIES in 1996 decreased $1.2 billion or 48% to
$1.3 billion  compared to an $89 million or 4% increase in 1995 to $2.5 billion.
The 1996 decline was principally due to the repatriation of funds we had held in
Puerto Rico. We manage the  investment  activity in our  short-term  portfolios,
which are  primarily  held  outside the U.S.,  as part of our overall  financing
strategy.  We continually reassess our alternatives to redeploy them considering
investment  opportunities  and risks,  tax  consequences  and current  financing
activity.  As a result of the Small  Business Job  Protection  Act of 1996,  our
exemption from U.S. Federal income tax on investment  income generated in Puerto
Rico was completely eliminated effective as of December 1, 1996. Accordingly, as
our  investments  in Puerto Rico mature,  we are  repatriating  the proceeds and
using them to reduce  outstanding  commercial  paper debt. We  repatriated  $690
million in 1996.
     Capital spending  increased $183 million,  reflecting higher North American
snack foods  investments  of $195  million,  primarily  for capacity  expansion.
Increased spending in worldwide beverages of $85 million was offset by decreased
spending in worldwide  restaurants,  primarily in the U.S.,  of $82 million.  In
1995,  capital spending declined $149 million reflecting  substantially  reduced
spending in  restaurants.  Increased 1995 North  American snack foods  spending,
primarily for capacity  expansion and new  products,  was partially  offset by a
decline in beverages.  Capital spending outside of the U.S. represented 30%, 29%
and 35% of total capital spending in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

NET CASH  USED FOR  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  more than  doubled  in 1996 to $2.9
billion,   primarily   reflecting  a  $1.1  billion   increase  in  our  share
repurchases  and increased  debt  payments of $498 million.  Net cash used for
financing  activities  in 1995 of $1.2  billion was  unchanged  from the prior

      In 1996,  free cash flow increased  $449 million or 41%,  reflecting the
strong  increase  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.   Higher
proceeds  from  restaurant   refranchising   were  offset  by  higher  capital
spending.   In  1995,  free  cash  flow  advanced  $385  million  or  35%  due
primarily to refranchising of restaurants and the lower capital spending.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION

ASSETS  decreased $920 million or 4% to $24.5 billion.  The decline  reflected
the  repatriation  of funds from our investment  portfolio in Puerto Rico, the
impact of the unusual  impairment, 



disposal  and other  charges of $822 million (see Note 3) and the effects of the
restaurant  program  to  refranchise  stores and close  underperforming  stores,
partially  offset by normal  business  growth.  Short-term  investments  largely
represent high-grade  marketable  securities portfolios held outside the U.S. As
discussed,  we are  repatriating  the funds from our portfolio in Puerto Rico as
our investments  mature and we are using them to reduce our short-term debt. Our
Puerto Rico portfolio  totaled $126 million at year-end 1996 and $816 million at
year-end  1995.  We expect to  repatriate  most of the year-end  1996 balance in
1997. The increase in prepaid expenses,  deferred income taxes and other current
assets principally  reflected a  reclassification  of the carrying amount of our
non-core U.S.  restaurant  long-lived assets,  partially offset by a significant
decline in current deferred income taxes. These non-core  restaurants assets are
now being held for disposal and carried at estimated fair market value.
     LIABILITIES  decreased  $230  million or 1% to $17.9  billion.  The decline
reflected the pay-down of short-term debt with the funds repatriated from Puerto
Rico,   partially  offset  by  increased  accounts  payable  and  other  current
liabilities, due in part to the International beverages restructuring charge.
     At year-end  1996 and 1995,  $3.5  billion of  short-term  borrowings  were
reclassified  as  long-term,  reflecting  our intent and  ability,  through  the
existence  of  our  unused  revolving  credit  facilities,  to  refinance  these
borrowings.  Our unused  credit  facilities,  which exist largely to support the
issuances of short-term borrowings, were $3.5 billion at year-end 1996 and 1995.
Effective  January 10,  1997,  we extended to 2002 $3.3  billion of these credit
facilities.  Annually,  these facilities can be extended an additional year upon
the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions.
     Our strong  cash-generating  capability and our strong financial  condition
give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world.
     We measure  FINANCIAL  LEVERAGE on both a market value and historical  cost
basis.  We believe that the most  meaningful  measure of debt is on a net basis,
which takes into account our investment  portfolios  held outside the U.S. These
portfolios  are managed as part of our overall  financing  strategy  and are not
required  to support  day-to-day  operations.  Net debt  reflects  the pro forma
remittance  of the  portfolios  (net of related  taxes) as a reduction  of total
debt. Total debt includes the present value of operating lease commitments.
     We also use market leverage to measure our long-term financial leverage. We
define  market  leverage  as net debt as a percent  of net debt plus the  market
value of equity,  based on the year-end  stock  price.  Unlike  historical  cost
measures,  the market  value of equity  primarily  reflects  the  estimated  net
present  value of  expected  future cash flows that will both  support  debt and
provide returns to shareholders.
     The market net debt ratio was  unchanged  in 1996,  largely  because the 6%
increase  in our  year-end  stock price was offset by a 2% decline in our shares
outstanding.  In 1995,  the market  net debt ratio  declined 8 points to 18% due
primarily to a 54% increase in our stock price.
     Measured on a historical  cost basis,  the ratio of net debt to net capital
employed  (defined as net debt,  other  liabilities,  deferred  income taxes and
shareholders' equity) increased 2 points to 48% in 1996, reflecting a 3% decline
in net  capital  employed.  The  3-point  decline to 46% in 1995  reflected a 2%
decline in net debt and a 4% increase in net capital employed.

      Our negative  operating  working  capital  position,  which reflects the
cash sales nature of our restaurant  operations  partially  offset by our more
working capital  intensive  packaged goods  businesses,  effectively  provides
additional   capital  for  investment.   Operating   working  capital,   which
excludes  short-term  investments  and short-term  borrowings,  was a negative
$313   million  and   negative   $94  million  at  year-end   1996  and  1995,
respectively.  The $219 million  increase in negative  working capital in 1996
primarily  reflected  reclassifications  of a portion of other liabilities and
deferred  income taxes to income taxes payable and accounts  payable and other
current  liabilities,   respectively,  and  a  decline  in  operating  working
capital in our International  beverages  business.  The increase was partially
offset by the  reclassification  of our non-core  U.S.  restaurant  long-lived
assets  held for  disposal  to prepaid  expenses,  deferred  income  taxes and
other  current  assets in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The  decline  in
International  beverages  reflected  higher  accrued  liabilities  due  to the
restructuring charge, coupled with lower receivables from a decline in sales.

      SHAREHOLDERS'  EQUITY  decreased  $690  million  or 9% to $6.6  billion.
This  change was the result of a $1.3  billion  increase  in  treasury  stock,
reflecting  repurchases  of 54.2 million  shares offset by 22.7 million shares
used  for  stock  option  exercises.  This  decrease  was  mitigated  by  a 5%
increase  in  retained  earnings  due  to  $1.1  billion  in net  income  less
dividends declared of $695 million.

Cautionary Statements
- ---------------------
From time to time,  in written  reports  and oral  statements,  we discuss our
expectations    regarding   future   performance   of   the   Company.   These
"forward-looking  statements"  are based on currently  available  competitive,
financial  and  economic  data  and  our  operating   plans.   They  are  also
inherently  uncertain,  and investors  must  recognize  that events could turn
out to be significantly  different from what we had expected.  In addition, as
discussed in the Management's Analysis:

- -  The  forecasted  annual  savings  of $50  million  in 1997,  and  about $80
   million  a  year  thereafter   related  to  the   International   beverages
   restructuring  charge  (page 22) assumes  that  facilities  are vacated and
   employees  are  terminated  within  the time  frames  used to  develop  the
   estimate.



- -  The  expectation  that our  reported  results  in Mexico  will be  slightly
   lower  than what they  would have been had we not  changed  our  functional
   currency  from the peso to the U.S.  dollar (page 25) assumes that the peso
   will not devalue significantly in 1997.

- -  The  spin-off  of our core  restaurant  businesses  (page 26) is subject to
   receipt of a tax ruling by the  Internal  Revenue  Service that would allow
   it to be  tax  free  to our  shareholders,  various  regulatory  approvals,
   appropriate  stock market  conditions for  distribution  and final approval
   by our Board of Directors.

- -  The  impairment  charge  recorded to reduce our  investment in our non-core
   U.S.  restaurant  businesses to estimated fair market value assumed certain
   sales  prices based  primarily  upon the opinion of an  investment  banking
   firm.  These  estimates  could  vary  significantly  from the  final  sales
   prices (page 26).

- -  Our  ability to execute  our  restaurant  refranchising  program  (page 28)
   depends on our ability to find  investors  to purchase our  restaurants  at
   prices we consider appropriate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts)

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  preparation of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting   period.   Actual   results   could  differ  from  those   estimates.
     Certain  reclassifications  were made to prior  year  amounts to conform
with the 1996 presentation.  
     PRINCIPLES   OF   CONSOLIDATION.   The  financial statements   reflect  the
consolidated   accounts  of  PepsiCo,   Inc.  and  its  controlled   affiliates.
Intercompany  accounts and  transactions  have been  eliminated.  Investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates in which PepsiCo exercises  significant influence but
not control are accounted  for by the equity  method and PepsiCo's  share of the
net income or loss of its  unconsolidated  affiliates  is  included  in selling,
general and administrative expenses.
     FISCAL YEAR.  PepsiCo's  fiscal year ends on the last  Saturday in December
and,  as a result,  a  fifty-third  week is added  every five or six years.  The
fiscal year ending December 31, 1994 consisted of 53 weeks.
     MARKETING  COSTS.  Marketing  costs are  reported in  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses and include costs of  advertising  and other  marketing
activities.  Marketing  costs not  deferred at  year-end  are charged to expense
ratably  in  relation  to sales  over the  year in which  incurred.  Advertising
expenses  were $1.9  billion,  $1.8 billion and $1.7  billion in 1996,  1995 and
1994,  respectively.  Advertising  expenses  deferred  at  year-end,  which  are
classified in prepaid  expenses,  deferred income taxes and other current assets
in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet, were $49 million and $78 million in 1996 and
1995, respectively.  Deferred advertising consists of media and personal service
advertising-related   prepayments,   promotional   materials  in  inventory  and
production costs of future media  advertising;  these assets are expensed in the
year first used.
     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses, which
are expensed as  incurred,  were $115  million,  $96 million and $152 million in
1996, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  
     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. PepsiCo measures stock-based compensation cost as
the excess of the quoted  market price of PepsiCo's  capital  stock at the grant
date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock. PepsiCo's policy is to
generally grant stock options at fair market value at the date of grant.
     STOCK  SPLIT.  On May 1, 1996  PepsiCo's  Board of  Directors  authorized a
two-for-one stock split of PepsiCo's capital stock effective for shareholders of
record at the close of business on May 10, 1996. The number of authorized shares
was  increased  from  1.8  billion  to  3.6  billion.  The  information  in  the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  as well as all  other  share  data in this
report,  have been  adjusted  to reflect  the stock  split and the  increase  in
authorized  shares. The par value remains 1 2/3 cents per share, with capital in
excess of par value  reduced  to reflect  the total par value of the  additional
shares.
     NET INCOME PER SHARE.  Net income per share is  computed  by  dividing  net
income by the weighted  average number of shares and dilutive share  equivalents
(primarily stock options) outstanding (average shares outstanding).

                             F-8


     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. The interest differential to be paid or received on
an interest rate swap is recognized as an adjustment to interest  expense as the
differential  occurs.  The  interest  differential  not yet  settled  in cash is
reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a receivable or payable under the
appropriate  current  asset or  liability  caption.  If an  interest  rate  swap
position was to be terminated,  the gain or loss realized upon termination would
be deferred and  amortized to interest  expense over the  remaining  term of the
underlying  debt  instrument  it was  intended to modify or would be  recognized
immediately if the underlying debt instrument was settled prior to maturity.
     The  differential  to be paid or  received  on a currency  swap  related to
non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt is  charged  or  credited  to  income as the
differential  occurs.  This is fully  offset by the  corresponding  gain or loss
recognized  in income on the currency  translation  of the debt, as both amounts
are based  upon the same  exchange  rates.  The  currency  differential  not yet
settled  in cash is  reflected  in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  under  the
appropriate  current or noncurrent  receivable or payable caption. If a currency
swap position was to be terminated prior to maturity,  the gain or loss realized
upon termination would be immediately recognized in income.
     A seven-year put option, issued in connection with the formation of a joint
venture with the principal  shareholder of Grupo  Embotellador  de Mexico,  S.A.
(GEMEX) in 1995, an unconsolidated  franchised  bottling affiliate in Mexico, is
marked-to-market  with gains or losses recognized  currently as an adjustment to
PepsiCo's share of the net income of unconsolidated  affiliates.  The offsetting
amount adjusts the carrying amount of the put obligation  which is classified in
other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
     Gains  and  losses  on  futures  contracts  designated  as hedges of future
commodity  purchases  are  deferred  and included in the cost of the related raw
materials when purchased. Changes in the value of futures contracts that PepsiCo
uses to hedge  commodity  purchases are highly  correlated to the changes in the
value of the  purchased  commodity.  If the degree of  correlation  between  the
futures contracts and the purchase  contracts were to diminish such that the two
were no longer considered highly correlated,  subsequent changes in the value of
the futures contracts would be recognized in income.
     CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash equivalents  represent funds  temporarily  invested
(with  original  maturities  not  exceeding  three  months) as part of PepsiCo's
management of day-to-day  operating cash receipts and  disbursements.  All other
investment  portfolios,  largely held outside the U.S., are primarily classified
as short-term investments.
     INVENTORIES.  Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the
average,  first-in,  first-out or last-in,  first-out  method) or net realizable
value.
     PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  Property,  plant and equipment  (PP&E) are
stated at cost, except for PP&E that have been impaired,  for which the carrying
amount is reduced to estimated fair market value.  Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
     INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over appropriate periods, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years.
     RECOVERABILITY  OF  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IN THE BUSINESS.
PepsiCo reviews most long-lived  assets,  certain  identifiable  intangibles and
goodwill  related  to  those  assets  to  be  held  and  used  in  the  business
semi-annually  for impairment,  or whenever  events or changes in  circumstances
indicate  that the  carrying  amount of an asset or a group of 

                             F-9


assets may not be recoverable. PepsiCo uses a history of operating losses as its
primary indicator of potential impairment.  Assets are grouped and evaluated for
impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable  cash flows that
are largely  independent  of the cash flows of other groups of assets  (Assets).
PepsiCo has  identified  the  appropriate  grouping  of Assets to be  individual
restaurants  for the  restaurants  segment  and, for each of the snack foods and
beverages  segments,  Assets are  generally  grouped at the  country  level.  An
impaired  Asset is written down to its estimated  fair market value based on the
best information  available;  PepsiCo generally  measures  estimated fair market
value by  discounting  estimated  future  cash  flows.  Considerable  management
judgment is necessary  to estimate  discounted  future cash flows.  Accordingly,
actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
     PepsiCo's  methodology  for  determining  and  measuring  impairment of its
investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and  enterprise  level goodwill was
changed  in 1996 to  conform  with the  methodology  it uses when  applying  the
provisions  of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be  Disposed  Of,"  except  (a) the  recognition  test for an  investment  in an
unconsolidated  affiliate  compares  the  investment  to a forecast of PepsiCo's
share  of the  unconsolidated  affiliate's  undiscounted  cash  flows  including
interest and taxes,  compared to  undiscounted  cash flows  before  interest and
taxes used for all other long-lived  assets and (b) enterprise level goodwill is
evaluated  at a  country  level  for  the  restaurants  segment,  instead  of by
individual restaurant.  The change in methodology did not have a material impact
in 1996.

(a) Pre-tax amounts.

     See Note 3 for information regarding unusual impairment, disposal and other
charges.
     See Note 17 for  information  regarding  the 1994 gain from a public  share
offering by Buenos Aires Embotelladora S.A. (BAESA), our Latin American bottling
joint venture.
     Net refranchising (gains)/losses reflected PepsiCo's strategy to reduce its
ownership in its restaurant businesses by selling  company-operated  restaurants
to franchisees and closing  underperforming  units. See Management's  Analysis -
Restaurants beginning on page 26.
     Reduced depreciation and amortization reflected the reduced carrying amount
of PepsiCo's  long-lived  assets to be held and used in the business as a result
of  the  fourth  quarter  1995  adoption  of  SFAS  121.  See  Items   Affecting
Comparability  - Unusual  Impairment,  Disposal and Other Charges in Note 19 for
the estimated  impact of the reduced  depreciation  and  amortization on segment
operating profit.
     See  Note  4  for  information  regarding  the  1996  recurring  restaurant
impairment charges.
     The fifty-third  week in 1994 increased 1994 net sales by an estimated $434
million.  See Items  Affecting  Comparability  - Fiscal  Year in Note 19 for the
estimated  impact of the  fifty-third  week on segment  net sales and  operating
profit.

                             F-11




(a)     Pre-tax amounts.

PepsiCo  recognized  unusual  impairment,  disposal  and other  charges  of $822
million ($716 million  after-tax or $0.45 per share) in 1996. The  International
beverages  charge  included $454 million  ($429  million  after-tax or $0.27 per
share)  related  primarily  to  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and
concentrate-related and non-core assets (primarily packaging) and its 24% equity
share of  unusual  charges  recorded  by  BAESA.  In  addition,  it  included  a
restructuring  charge of $122 million ($98 million after-tax or $0.06 per share)
related to a fourth quarter  reorganization into 10 business units and reduction
of  support  staff.  The charge  primarily  reflected  severance-related  costs,
relocation  costs for employees  who, in 1996,  accepted  offers to relocate and
facility  closing costs.  Included in the  International  beverages  charges are
impairment charges of $373 million (see Note 4).
        The non-core  U.S.  restaurant  businesses  charge of $246 million ($189
million after-tax or $0.12 per share) was a result of a decision made by PepsiCo
in the  fourth  quarter  of 1996 to  dispose  of its  non-core  U.S.  restaurant
businesses;  California  Pizza Kitchen (CPK),  Chevys,  D'Angelo  Sandwich Shops
(D'Angelo)  and East Side Mario's (ESM) and a first quarter  decision to dispose
of Hot `n Now (HNN). The charge was primarily composed of impairment charges and
estimated  disposal  costs (see Note 4). The  remaining  carrying  amount of the
assets of these non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses of $333 million is included
in 1996 in Prepaid  expenses,  deferred income taxes and other current assets in
the Consolidated  Balance Sheet as PepsiCo plans to dispose of them in 1997. The
non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses  contributed $394 million, $297 million and
$281 million to net sales in 1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Excluding the
unusual  impairment,  disposal and other charges in 1996 and 1995,  the non-core
U.S. restaurant businesses incurred operating losses of $10 million, $42 million
and $40 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
        PepsiCo early adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of the fourth quarter
of 1995. The initial,  noncash charge upon adoption of SFAS 121 was $520 million
($384 million after-tax or $0.24 per share). See Note 4.
                                      F-12


Note 4 - IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Impairment  charges of $681 million ($396 million  after-tax or $0.25 per share)
in 1996 and $520  million  ($384  million  after-tax or $0.24 per share) in 1995
included in the Consolidated Statement of Income are set forth below:



        The unusual charges and the recurring restaurant charges are included in
unusual  impairment,  disposal  and  other  charges  and  selling,  general  and
administrative expenses, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
        The impairment  charges  represented a reduction of the carrying amounts
of impaired Assets to their  estimated fair market value.  For assets to be held
and used in the business,  estimated fair market value was generally  determined
by using discounted estimated future cash flows. The estimated fair market value
for assets to be disposed of was  determined by using  estimated  selling prices
based  primarily upon the opinion of an investment  banking firm,  less costs to
sell.  Considerable  management  judgment is necessary  to estimate  fair market
value. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
        The  International  beverages  assets  were  deemed  impaired  due  to a
reduction  in  forecasted   cash  flows  that  was   attributable  to  increased
competitive  activity and weakened  macroeconomic  factors in various geographic
regions and an estimate of the fair market value,  less estimated costs to sell,
of certain non-core businesses PepsiCo decided to dispose of.
        The charges for PepsiCo's  non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses  were a
result of decisions made by PepsiCo to dispose of its non-core U.S. restaurant
businesses:  CPK, Chevys, D'Angelo, ESM and HNN. See Note 3.
        The recurring SFAS 121 restaurant  charge  resulted from the semi-annual
impairment  evaluations  of  all  restaurants  that  either  initially  met  the
"two-year history of operating losses" impairment indicator that PepsiCo uses to
identify  potentially  impaired  restaurants  or were  previously  evaluated for
impairment and, due to changes in  circumstances,  a current  forecast of future
cash flows would be expected to be significantly lower than the forecast used in
the prior evaluation.
        PepsiCo early adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
121 (SFAS 121),  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for
Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of," as of the beginning of the fourth quarter
of 1995. The initial  charge  resulted from PepsiCo  grouping  assets at a lower
level than under its previous  accounting  policy for  evaluating  and measuring
impairment.  This initial charge affected worldwide  
                                      F-13

restaurants, International beverages and, to a much lesser extent, International
snack foods and certain unconsolidated affiliates.
        As a result of the reduced carrying amount of certain  long-lived assets
due to the adoption of SFAS 121,  depreciation and amortization  expense for the
fourth  quarter of 1995 was reduced by $21 million  ($15  million  after-tax  or
$0.01 per share) and for the first three  quarters  of 1996 by $46 million  ($29
million after-tax or $0.02 per share). See Items Affecting Comparability in Note
19.



The cost of 33% of 1996  inventories  and 32% of 1995  inventories  was computed
using the last-in,  first-out  (LIFO) method.  The carrying amount of total LIFO
inventories was lower than the approximate  current cost of those inventories by
$8 million at year-end 1996 and $11 million at year-end 1995.





Identifiable  intangible  assets primarily arose from the allocation of purchase
prices of businesses acquired. Amounts assigned to such identifiable intangibles
were based on independent appraisals or internal estimates.  Goodwill represents
the residual  purchase price after  allocation to all  identifiable  net assets.
     Accumulated  amortization,  included in the amounts above, was $2.1 billion
and $1.8 billion at year-end 1996 and 1995, respectively.

                             F-14




Note 9 - LEASES

PepsiCo has noncancelable commitments under both capital and long-term operating
leases,  primarily for restaurant units. Capital and operating lease commitments
expire at various  dates  through  2087 and,  in many  cases,  provide  for rent
escalations  and  renewal  options.  Most  leases  require  payment  of  related
executory  costs,  which include  property  taxes,  maintenance  and  insurance.
Sublease income and sublease receivables were insignificant.
        Future  minimum  commitments  under  noncancelable  leases are set forth
below:



        At year-end  1996,  the present value of minimum  payments under capital
leases was $263  million,  after  deducting $1 million for  estimated  executory
costs and $190 million representing imputed interest.


     Contingent  rentals are based on sales by  restaurants  in excess of levels
stipulated in the lease agreements.

                             F-15




The  interest  rates in the above  table  included  the  effects  of  associated
interest rate and currency  swaps at year-end  1996 and 1995.  See Note 11 for a
discussion of PepsiCo's use of interest rate and currency swaps,  its management
of the  inherent  credit  risk and fair  value  information  related to debt and
interest rate and currency swaps.
        The carrying  amount of long-term debt includes any related  discount or
premium and unamortized debt issuance costs. The debt agreements include various
restrictions, none of which are currently significant to PepsiCo.
        The annual maturities of long-term debt through 2001,  excluding capital
lease obligations and the reclassified  short-term  borrowings,  are:  1997-$1.9
billion,  1998-$1.9 billion,  1999-$1.1 billion, 2000-$952 million and 2001-$218
million.
        (A) The  following  table  indicates  the  notional  amount and weighted
average  interest  rates,  by category,  of interest rate swaps  outstanding  at
year-end 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  The weighted average  variable  interest
rates that PepsiCo pays, which are primarily  indexed to either commercial paper
or LIBOR rates, were based on rates as of the respective  balance sheet date and
are subject to change. Terms of interest rate swaps generally match the terms of
the debt they modify. The swaps terminate at various dates through 2011.

                             F-16



        The following table  identifies the composition of total debt (excluding
capital  lease  obligations  and before  the  reclassification  of amounts  from
short-term borrowings) after giving effect to the impact of interest rate swaps.
All  short-term  borrowings  are  considered  variable  interest  rate  debt for
purposes of this table.


        (B) Included certain long-term notes aggregating $110 million, which are
reasonably expected to be called,  without penalty, by PepsiCo in 1997. The 1996
amount was $248  million.  The  expectation  is based upon the belief of PepsiCo
management  that,  based upon  projected  yield curves,  our  counterparties  to
interest  rate  swaps,  which were  entered  into to modify  these  notes,  will
exercise  their  option to early  terminate  the  swaps  without  penalty.  Also
included  in 1995  is the  $214  million  carrying  amount  of the  Swiss  franc
perpetual  Foreign  Interest  Payment  bonds in 1995,  which were expected to be
redeemed  in 1996.  At  year-end  1996,  $39  million of these  bonds were still
outstanding and are classified as long-term debt (see (E) below).
        (C)  PepsiCo  has  entered  into  currency  swaps to hedge its  currency
exposure on non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt. At year-end 1996, the aggregate
carrying  amount of the debt was $1.8 billion and the  receivables  and payables
under  related  currency  swaps were $54 million and $59 million,  respectively,
resulting  in a net  effective  U.S.  dollar  liability  of $1.8  billion with a
weighted  average  interest  rate of 5.6%,  including  the  

                             F-17



effects of related interest rate swaps. At year-end 1995, the carrying amount of
this debt aggregated $696 million and the receivables and payables under related
currency swaps aggregated $5 million and $12 million, respectively, resulting in
a net effective U.S.  dollar  liability of $703 million with a weighted  average
interest rate of 5.8%, including the effects of related interest rate swaps.
        (D) At  year-end  1996 and 1995,  PepsiCo  had unused  revolving  credit
facilities  covering potential  borrowings  aggregating $3.5 billion expiring in
2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Effective  January 10, 1997,  PepsiCo extended to
2002 $3.3  billion of the credit  facilities.  At year-end  1996 and 1995,  $3.5
billion of short-term  borrowings were classified as long-term debt,  reflecting
PepsiCo's  intent and  ability,  through  the  existence  of the  unused  credit
facilities, to refinance these borrowings. These credit facilities exist largely
to support the issuances of short-term  borrowings and are available for general
corporate purposes.
        (E) The coupon  rate of the Swiss franc 400  million  perpetual  Foreign
Interest  Payment bonds issued in 1986 was 7 1/2% through 1996, and 5.6% through
2006. The bonds have no stated  maturity date. At the end of each 10-year period
after the issuance of the bonds, PepsiCo and the bondholders each have the right
to cause  redemption  of the bonds.  If not  redeemed,  the coupon  rate will be
adjusted based on the prevailing yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities.  The
principal of the bonds is denominated in Swiss francs.  PepsiCo can, and intends
to,  limit  the  ultimate  redemption  amount  to the U.S.  dollar  proceeds  at
issuance,  which is the basis of the carrying amount. Interest payments are made
in U.S.  dollars and are  calculated by applying the coupon rate to the original
U.S. dollar principal proceeds.  This debt was included in current maturities of
long-term debt (see (B) above) at year-end 1995 because the  bondholders had the
right to cause  PepsiCo  to redeem the debt in 1996 on its  10-year  anniversary
date. During 1996, $175 million of this debt was redeemed.


Note 11 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative Instruments
- ----------------------
PepsiCo's  policy  prohibits  the  use of  derivative  instruments  for  trading
purposes and PepsiCo has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
        PepsiCo's use of derivative instruments is primarily limited to interest
rate and currency  swaps,  which are entered into with the objective of reducing
borrowing  costs.  PepsiCo  enters  into  interest  rate and  currency  swaps to
effectively  change the interest rate and currency of specific  debt  issuances.
These swaps are  generally  entered into  concurrently  with the issuance of the
debt they are intended to modify.  The notional  amount,  interest payment dates
and maturity dates of the swaps generally match the principal,  interest payment
dates and maturity  dates of the related debt.  Accordingly,  any market risk or
opportunity  associated with these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact
on the related debt. PepsiCo's credit risk related to interest rate and currency
swaps is  considered  low  because  they  are  only  entered  into  with  strong
creditworthy  counterparties,  are  generally  settled on a net basis and are of
relatively  short  duration.  See  Note 10 for  the  notional  amounts,  related
interest rates and maturities of the interest rate and currency swaps.

                             F-18




     The carrying  amounts in the above table are  included in the  Consolidated
Balance Sheet under the indicated captions,  except for debt-related  derivative
instruments  (interest  rate and  currency  swaps),  which are  included  in the
appropriate  current  or  noncurrent  asset  or  liability  caption.  Short-term
investments  consist  primarily of debt  securities and have been  classified as
held-to-maturity. Noncurrent investments mature at various dates through 2000.
     Because  of  the  short  maturity  of  cash   equivalents   and  short-term
investments,  the carrying  amount  approximates  fair value.  The fair value of
noncurrent  investments  is based upon  market  quotes.  The fair value of debt,
debt-related  derivative  instruments  and guarantees is estimated  using market
quotes,  valuation models and calculations based on market rates. The fair value
of the GEMEX put option (see Note 1) is based upon a valuation model.


Note 12 - EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

PepsiCo grants stock options to employees pursuant to three different  incentive
plans - the SharePower Stock Option Plan (SharePower),  the Long-Term  Incentive
Plan (LTIP) and the Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP).  All stock option grants
are  authorized by the  Compensation  Committee of 

                             F-19


PepsiCo's  Board of  Directors  (the Committee),  which is  comprised of outside
directors.
      Under  SharePower,  approved by the Board of  Directors  and  effective in
1989,  essentially all full-time  employees,  other than executive  officers and
short-service  employees,  may be granted stock options annually.  The number of
options  granted  is based  on each  employee's  annual  earnings.  The  options
generally become  exercisable  ratably over 5 years from the grant date and must
be exercised within 10 years of the grant date. SharePower options of 12 million
were granted to approximately  130,000  employees in 1996; 16 million to 134,000
employees in 1995; and 23 million to 128,000 employees in 1994.
      The  shareholder-approved  1994 LTIP  succeeds and continues the principal
features of the  shareholder-approved  1987 LTIP (the 1987 Plan). PepsiCo ceased
making  grants  under the 1987 Plan at the end of 1994.  Together,  these  plans
comprise the LTIP. At year-end 1996, there were 121 million shares available for
future grants under the LTIP.
      Most LTIP stock options are granted every other year to senior  management
employees.  Most of these options become  exercisable  after 4 years and must be
exercised  within 10 years from their grant date.  In addition,  the LTIP allows
for grants of performance share units (PSUs). The value of a PSU is fixed at the
value of a share of stock at the grant  date and vests for  payment 4 years from
the grant date,  contingent upon attainment of prescribed Corporate  performance
goals.  PSUs are not directly  granted,  as certain stock options granted may be
exchanged  by  employees  for a  specified  number of PSUs within 60 days of the
option  grant  date.  At  year-end  1996,  1995 and 1994,  there  were  916,100,
1,198,200 and 1,258,400 PSUs outstanding, respectively. Payment of PSUs are made
in cash and/or  stock as approved by the  Committee.  Amounts  expensed for PSUs
were $5 million for both 1996 and 1995 and $7 million in 1994.
      In  1995,  the  Committee  approved  the 1995  SOIP for  middle-management
employees.  SOIP stock  options  are  expected  to be granted  annually  and are
exercisable after 1 year and must be exercised within 10 years after their grant
date. At year-end 1996, there were 37 million shares available for future grants
under the SOIP. In 1994,  grants similar to those under the SOIP were made under
the LTIP to a more limited number of middle-management employees.
      Effective  in  1996,  PepsiCo  adopted  the  disclosure   requirements  of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),  "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation." As permitted under SFAS 123, PepsiCo will continue to
measure  stock-based  compensation cost as the excess of the quoted market price
of PepsiCo's  capital  stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must
pay for the stock.
      SFAS 123  requires  disclosure  of pro forma net  income and pro forma net
income per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring
compensation  cost for stock-based  awards granted in 1996 and 1995.  Management
believes  that 1996 and 1995 pro forma  amounts  are not  representative  of the
effects of  stock-based  awards on future pro forma net income and pro forma net
income  per  share  because  those  pro  forma  amounts  exclude  the pro  forma
compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted before 1995.

                             F-20




        The fair values of the options  granted  were  estimated  on the date of
their grant using the Black-Scholes  option-pricing model based on the following
weighted average assumptions:



                             F-21





Note 13 - POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES

Effective  the  beginning  of  1994,  PepsiCo  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting   Standards   No.  112  (SFAS  112),   "Employers'   Accounting   for
Postemployment Benefits." The principal effect to PepsiCo resulted from accruing
severance benefits to be provided to employees of certain business units who are
terminated in the ordinary course of business over the expected service lives of
the employees. Previously, these benefits were accrued upon the occurrence of an
event.  Severance  benefits resulting from actions not in the ordinary course of
business will continue to be accrued when those actions  occur.  The  cumulative
effect charge upon  adoption of SFAS 112,  which relates to years prior to 1994,
was $84 million ($55 million after-tax or $0.03 per share).


Note 14 - POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

PepsiCo  provides  postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  eligible  retired
employees and their  dependents,  principally  in the U.S.  Retirees who have 10
years of service and attain age 55 while in service with PepsiCo are eligible to
participate in the  postretirement  benefit plans.  The plans are not funded and
were largely noncontributory through 1993.
        Effective in 1993 and 1994,  PepsiCo  implemented  programs  intended to
stem rising costs and  introduced  retiree  cost-sharing,  including  adopting a
provision  that  limits  its  future  obligation  to  absorb  health  care  cost
inflation.  These amendments  resulted in an unrecognized  prior service gain of
$191 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining  employee  service period of  approximately 10 years as a reduction in
postretirement benefit expense beginning in 1993.

                             F-22




     The   discount   rate   assumptions   used  to  compute   the   accumulated
postretirement  benefit  obligation  were  7.8%  and  7.7%  in  1996  and  1995,
respectively.

     As a result of the plan amendments discussed above, separate assumed health
care cost trend  rates are used for  employees  who retire  before and after the
effective  date of the  amendments.  The assumed health care cost trend rate for
employees  who retired  before the effective  date was 8.1% for 1997,  declining
gradually  to 5.5% in 2010 and  thereafter.  For  employees  retiring  after the
effective date, the trend rate was 7.0% for 1997,  declining to zero in 2004 and
thereafter.  A 1 point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would
have increased the 1996  postretirement  benefit expense by $2 million and would
have increased the 1996  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation by $23
million.


Note 15 - PENSION PLANS

PepsiCo  sponsors   noncontributory   defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering
substantially  all  full-time  U.S.   employees  as  well  as  contributory  and
noncontributory  defined  benefit pension plans covering  certain  international
employees.  Benefits generally are based on years of service and compensation or
stated amounts for each year of service. PepsiCo funds the U.S. plans in amounts
not less than minimum statutory  funding  requirements nor more than the maximum
amount that can be deducted for U.S.  income tax purposes.  International  plans
are funded in amounts  sufficient to comply with local  statutory  requirements.
The plans' assets  consist  principally  of equity  securities,  government  and
corporate debt securities and other  fixed-income  obligations.  The U.S. plans'
assets included 12.2

                             F-23



million and 13.7 million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock in 1996 and 1995, with
a market value of $344 million and $350 million,  respectively.  In the interest
of maintaining an appropriate  level of  diversification  within the U.S. plans'
asset  portfolio,  1.5 million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock were sold during
the 1996 plan  year to offset  the large  increase  in market  value of  PepsiCo
capital stock holdings relative to other portfolio assets.  Dividends on PepsiCo
capital  stock of $5 million  were  received by the U.S.  plans in both 1996 and
1995.



                             F-24




                             F-25








                                      F-26




The discount  rates and rates of return for the  international  plans  represent
weighted averages.

        In 1994,  PepsiCo changed the method for calculating the  market-related
value of plan assets  used in  determining  the  return-on-assets  component  of
annual pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized  gain or loss subject
to amortization.  Under the previous  accounting  method, the calculation of the
market-related  value of assets  reflected  amortization  of the actual  capital
return on assets on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. Under the new
method,  the  calculation  of the  market-related  value of assets  reflects the
long-term rate of return expected by PepsiCo and  amortization of the difference
between the actual return  (including  capital,  dividends and interest) and the
expected  return over a five-year  period.  PepsiCo  believes  the new method is
widely used in practice and is preferable  because it results in calculated plan
asset values that more closely  approximate  fair value,  while still mitigating
the  effect of annual  market-value  fluctuations.  This  change  resulted  in a
noncash  benefit in 1994 of $38  million  ($23  million  after-tax  or $0.01 per
share)  representing the cumulative  effect of the change related to years prior
to 1994.



                             F-27





         PepsiCo operates centralized  concentrate  manufacturing  facilities in
Puerto Rico and Ireland under long-term tax  incentives.  The U.S. amount in the
above table  included  approximately  73%,  70% and 50% in 1996,  1995 and 1994,
respectively,  (consistent  with the income  subject to U.S.  tax) of the income
from sales of concentrate manufactured in Puerto Rico. The increases in 1996 and
1995  reflected  the effects of the 1993 U.S.  Federal  income tax  legislation,
which limited the U.S.  Federal tax credit on income earned in Puerto Rico.  See
Management's  Analysis - Provision for Income  Taxes  beginning on page 17 for a
discussion  of the  reduction  of the U.S.  Federal tax credit  associated  with
beverage concentrate operations in Puerto Rico.



         In accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles,  deferred
tax  liabilities  have  not  been  recognized  for  bases  differences  that are
essentially permanent in duration related to investments in foreign subsidiaries
and unconsolidated  affiliates.  These  differences,  which consist primarily of
unremitted   earnings  intended  to  be  indefinitely   reinvested,   aggregated
approximately  $4.0 billion at year-end 1996 and $4.5 billion at year-end  1995,
exclusive of amounts that if remitted in the future would result in little or no
tax  under  current  tax  laws  and  the  Puerto  Rico  tax   incentive   grant.
Determination  of the amount of  unrecognized  deferred tax  liabilities  is not
practicable.

                             F-28




     The  valuation  allowance  related to deferred tax assets  increased by $62
million in 1996  primarily  due to additions  related to current year  operating
losses and temporary differences in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions.
     Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $2.5 billion at year-end 1996 are
available  to reduce  future tax of certain  subsidiaries  and are  related to a
number of foreign and state jurisdictions.  Of these carryforwards,  $21 million
expire in 1997,  $2.2 billion  expire at various times between 1998 and 2010 and
$291 million may be carried forward indefinitely.
     Tax benefits  associated with exercises of stock options of $145 million in
1996, $91 million in 1995 and $27 million in 1994 were credited to shareholders'
equity.


Note 17 - STOCK OFFERING BY AN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE

In 1993, PepsiCo entered into an arrangement with the principal  shareholders of
Buenos Aires  Embotelladora  S.A. (BAESA),  a franchised bottler which currently
has operations in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay,  to form a
joint venture. PepsiCo contributed certain assets, primarily bottling operations
in Chile and Uruguay, while the principal shareholders  contributed all of their
shares in BAESA, representing 73% of the voting control and 43% of the ownership
interest.  Through this arrangement,  PepsiCo's  beneficial  ownership in BAESA,
which  is  accounted  for  by  the  equity  method,  was  26%.  Under  PepsiCo's
partnership  

                             F-29


agreement with the principal shareholders of BAESA, voting control of BAESA will
be transferred to PepsiCo no later than December 31, 1999.
        On March  24,  1994,  BAESA  completed  a public  offering  of 3 million
American  Depositary Shares (ADS) at $34.50 per ADS, which are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange. In conjunction with the offering, PepsiCo and certain other
shareholders  exercised options for the equivalent of 2 million ADS. As a result
of these  transactions,  PepsiCo's  ownership  in  BAESA  declined  to 24%.  The
transactions  generated  cash proceeds for BAESA of $136 million.  The resulting
one-time,  noncash  gain to PepsiCo was $18 million  ($17  million  after-tax or
$0.01 per share).


Note 18 - CONTINGENCIES

PepsiCo  is subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to  lawsuits,
taxes,  environmental  and other  matters  arising  out of the normal  course of
business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of
amounts  already  recognized  arising from such claims or  contingencies  is not
likely  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of
operations  or  financial  condition.  PepsiCo  was  contingently  liable  under
guarantees  for $338  million  and  $283  million  at  year-end  1996 and  1995,
respectively.  At year-end 1996, $74 million represented  contingent liabilities
to lessors as a result of PepsiCo  assigning  its interest in real estate leases
as a condition to the  refranchising of  company-operated  restaurants.  The $74
million  represented  the present value of the minimum  payments of the assigned
leases,  excluding any renewal option periods,  discounted at PepsiCo's  pre-tax
cost of debt. On a nominal basis,  the contingent  liability  resulting from the
assigned  leases was $115  million.  The balance of the  contingent  liabilities
primarily  reflected  guarantees to support  financial  arrangements  of certain
unconsolidated affiliates, and other restaurant franchisees.


Note 19 - BUSINESS SEGMENTS

PepsiCo operates on a worldwide basis within three industry segments: beverages,
snack foods and restaurants.  However,  as discussed in Note 21 and Management's
Analysis - Restaurants  beginning on page 26, PepsiCo  announced in 1997 that it
would pursue a spin off of its Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC  businesses  to its
shareholders  as  an  independent   publicly-traded   company  and  explore  the
possibility that PFS would be sold separately. In addition,  decisions were made
in 1996 to sell PepsiCo's non-core U.S. restaurant businesses (see Note 3).

Beverages
- ---------
The beverage segment  (beverages)  markets and distributes its Pepsi-Cola,  Diet
Pepsi,  Mountain Dew and other brands  worldwide,  and 7UP,  Diet 7UP,  Mirinda,
Pepsi Max and other brands internationally.  Beverages manufactures concentrates
of its brands for sale to  franchised  bottlers  worldwide.  Beverages  operates
bottling  plants and  distribution  facilities  located in North  America and in
various   International   markets  for  the  production  and   distribution   of
company-owned  and licensed brands.  Beverages also manufactures and distributes
ready-to-drink Lipton tea products in North America.

                             F-30


     Beverages  products are available in 191 countries and territories  outside
North America,  including  emerging  markets such as China,  the Czech Republic,
Hungary,  India, Poland,  Russia and Slovakia.  Principal  International markets
include Argentina,  Brazil, China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand and the
U.K.  Investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  are  primarily in  franchised
bottling and distribution operations.  Internationally,  the largest investments
in unconsolidated affiliates are GEMEX (Mexico), General Bottlers (Poland), Serm
Suk  (Thailand)  and SOPRESA  (Venezuela)  as well as the  aggregate  of several
investments in China. The primary investment in the U.S. is General Bottlers.

Snack Foods
- -----------
The snack food segment (snack foods) manufactures, distributes and markets salty
and sweet snacks  worldwide,  with  Frito-Lay  representing  the North  American
business.  Products  primarily  manufactured  and  distributed  in North America
include  Lay's and  Ruffles  brand  potato  chips,  Doritos and  Tostitos  brand
tortilla chips, Fritos brand corn chips,  Chee.tos brand cheese flavored snacks,
Rold Gold brand pretzels, a variety of dips and salsas and other brands. Low-fat
and no-fat versions of several core brands are also manufactured and distributed
in North  America.  Snack Foods  products  are  available  in 81  countries  and
territories  outside North  America.  Principal  International  markets  include
Australia,  Brazil, France, Mexico, the Netherlands,  Poland, Spain and the U.K.
International  snack foods  manufactures and distributes  salty snacks in almost
all countries and sweet snacks in certain countries, primarily in France, Mexico
and Poland.  Snack Foods has  investments in several  unconsolidated  affiliates
outside the U.S., the largest of which are Snack Ventures  Europe (SVE), a joint
venture with General  Mills,  Inc.,  which has  operations  on the  continent of
Europe, and an investment in Simba, a snack food operation in South Africa.

Restaurants
- -----------
The restaurant  segment  (restaurants) is engaged  principally in the operation,
development, franchising and licensing of the worldwide Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
KFC concepts. Restaurants also operates other non-core U.S. businesses including
CPK, Chevys,  D'Angelo, ESM and HNN. PepsiCo Restaurant Services Group (PRSG), a
new unit formed in 1996 which also  includes  the  existing  operations  of PFS,
PepsiCo's   restaurant   distribution   operation,   is   responsible   for  the
consolidation of many restaurants  activities.  The activities include licensing
arrangements in non-traditional  locations, real estate and asset management and
accounting   services  for  the  U.S.   operations   in  addition  to  worldwide
procurement.  PFS provides  food,  supplies and  equipment to  company-operated,
franchised and licensed units, principally in the U.S. Net sales and the related
estimated  operating profit of PFS' franchisee and licensee operations have been
included in U.S. restaurants results.
        Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC operate  throughout the U.S. Pizza Hut, KFC
and, to a lesser  extent,  Taco Bell  operate in 94  countries  and  territories
outside the U.S.  Principal  international  markets include  Australia,  Canada,
Japan,  Korea,  Mexico,  New  Zealand,   Spain  and  the  U.K.  Restaurants  has
investments  in several  unconsolidated  affiliates  outside the U.S.,  the most
significant of which are located in Japan and the U.K.

                             F-31


        Unallocated  expenses,  net included  corporate  headquarters  expenses,
minority  interests,  primarily in the Gamesa  (Mexico) and Wedel (Poland) snack
food businesses,  foreign exchange  translation and transaction gains and losses
and other items not allocated to the business segments.  Corporate  identifiable
assets  consist   principally  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term
investments, primarily held outside the U.S.
        PepsiCo has invested in about 85  unconsolidated  affiliates in which it
exercises significant influence but not control. As noted above, the investments
are primarily  international  and  principally  within  PepsiCo's three industry
segments.
        PepsiCo's year-end investments in unconsolidated affiliates totaled $1.4
billion in 1996 and $1.6  billion in 1995.  The decrease in 1996  reflected  the
unusual  impairment,  disposal  and other  charges of $256  million  recorded by
International  beverages (see below) and the consolidation of CPK, previously an
unconsolidated  equity  investment,  at the end of the  second  quarter of 1996.
Significant investments in unconsolidated affiliates at year-end 1996 included a
combined  $306  million in General  Bottlers  U.S.  and Poland,  $206 million in
GEMEX, $140 million in a KFC Japan joint venture and $99 million in SVE.

ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY

UNUSUAL IMPAIRMENT, DISPOSAL AND OTHER CHARGES
Beverages and  restaurants  operating  profit and equity (loss) income  included
$320  million,  $246  million  and  $256  million,   respectively,   of  unusual
impairment,  disposal  and  other  charges  in 1996.  The  charges  included  in
beverages  operating  profit  and equity  (loss)  income  reflected  impairment,
disposal and other costs related to International  investments in unconsolidated
affiliates  and  concentrate-related  and  non-core  assets  as  well  as  costs
associated with a restructuring  of  International  operations.  The restaurants
charge  reflected  management's  decisions  in  1996  to  dispose  of all of its
non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses:  CPK, Chevys,  D'Angelo,  ESM and HNN. See
Note 3.
        PepsiCo  adopted SFAS 121 as of the  beginning of the fourth  quarter of
1995.  See Note 4. The initial,  noncash  charges  reduced  operating  profit as
follows:
                           
                                                                           ----

               (a)    HNN and  Chevys  incurred  $103 of this  charge,  with HNN
                      responsible for almost all of the charge.

                                      F-32


        As a result of the  reduced  carrying  amount of  certain  of  PepsiCo's
long-lived  assets to be held and used in the  business in  connection  with the
1995 adoption of SFAS 121,  depreciation and amortization  expense for the first
three quarters of 1996 and the fourth quarter of 1995 was reduced by $46 million
and $21 million, respectively, as follows:
        
                                           1996                  1995

RECURRING RESTAURANT IMPAIRMENT
Restaurants  operating profit in 1996 included impairment charges of $62 million
as a result of the ongoing application of SFAS 121 to long-lived assets held and
used in the business. See Note 4.

NET REFRANCHISING GAINS
Restaurants  operating profit in 1996 and 1995 included net gains of $99 million
and $55 million,  respectively,  from  refranchising of restaurants in excess of
the cost of closing other  restaurants.  These gains  compared to $10 million of
costs in 1994 to close stores.

FISCAL YEAR
Fiscal year 1994 consisted of 53 weeks, and the years 1995 and 1996 consisted of
52 weeks.  The  fifty-third  week  increased 1994  consolidated  net sales by an
estimated $434 million and beverages,  snack foods and  restaurants net sales by
$119 million, $143 million and $172 million,  respectively. The fifty-third week
increased  1994  consolidated  operating  profit by an estimated $65 million and
beverages,  snack foods and  restaurants  operating  profit by $17 million,  $26
million and $23 million,  respectively,  and increased unallocated expenses, net
by $1 million.

      franchisees  in  excess  of  costs  of  closing  other  restaurants.   The
      depreciation  and  amortization  reduction for the first three quarters of
      1996 arose from the  adoption of SFAS 121, at the  beginning of the fourth
      quarter of 1995,  which reduced the carrying amount of certain  long-lived
      assets to be held and used in the  business  (see Note 4). The  restaurant
      impairment charges represent the ongoing application of SFAS 121 (see Note
      4).

Note 21 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In January 1997,  PepsiCo  announced that it would pursue a plan to spin off its
restaurant  businesses to its  shareholders as an independent  publicly-  traded
company. The new company will include both the U.S. and international operations
of PepsiCo's core restaurant concepts - Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC. PepsiCo is
exploring the possibility that PFS, our restaurant distribution operation,  will
be sold separately. Subject to a 

                             F-40


tax ruling by the Internal  Revenue  Service that would allow the spin off to be
tax free to shareholders, various regulatory approvals, appropriate stock market
conditions  for  distribution,  and  final  approval  from  PepsiCo's  Board  of
Directors, PepsiCo expects to complete these activities by the end of 1997.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To Our Shareholders:

Management is  responsible  for the  reliability of the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  related  notes,  which have been  prepared in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and include  amounts based upon our
estimates  and  assumptions,  as required.  The financial  statements  have been
audited and reported on by our independent auditors,  KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, who
were given free access to all  financial  records and  related  data,  including
minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors  and  Committees of the Board.
We believe that management representations made to the independent auditors were
valid and appropriate.

        PepsiCo maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting,
designed to provide reasonable  assurance as to the reliability of the financial
statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
The system is supported by formal policies and  procedures,  including an active
Code of Conduct  program  intended  to ensure  employees  adhere to the  highest
standards of personal  and  professional  integrity.  PepsiCo's  internal  audit
function  monitors  and  reports  on the  adequacy  of and  compliance  with the
internal  control  system,   and  appropriate   actions  are  taken  to  address
significant  control  deficiencies  and other  opportunities  for  improving the
system as they are  identified.  The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors,
which is  composed  solely  of  outside  directors,  provides  oversight  to our
financial  reporting  process  and our  controls  to  safeguard  assets  through
periodic  meetings  with  our  independent   auditors,   internal  auditors  and
management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free access
to the Audit Committee.

        Although no  cost-effective  internal  control  system will preclude all
errors and  irregularities,  we believe our  controls  as of  December  28, 1996
provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are reliable and that
our assets are reasonably safeguarded.

                             F-42




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of  December  28,  1996 and  December  30, 1995 and the related
consolidated  statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each
of  the  years  in  the  three-year   period  ended  December  28,  1996.  These
consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of PepsiCo,  Inc.'s
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of PepsiCo,
Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December  28, 1996 and December 30, 1995,  and the
results  of its  operations  and its cash  flows  for  each of the  years in the
three-year period ended December 28, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

        As  discussed  in  Note  4 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,
PepsiCo,  Inc.  in 1995  adopted  the  provisions  of the  Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board's  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of." As discussed in Notes 15 and 13 to the  consolidated  financial
statements,  PepsiCo,  Inc.  in 1994  changed  its  method for  calculating  the
market-related value of pension plan assets used in the determination of pension
expense and adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'  Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," respectively.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA                                        (Page 6 of 7)
(in millions except per share and employee amounts, unaudited)
PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        All share and per share  amounts  reflect a  two-for-one  stock split in
1996 and three-for-one stock splits in 1990 and 1986. Additionally, PepsiCo made
numerous  acquisitions in most years presented and a few divestitures in certain
years.  Such  transactions  did  not  materially  affect  the  comparability  of
PepsiCo's operating results for the periods presented,  except for certain large
acquisitions  made in 1986,  1988 and 1989 and the $246 ($189 after-tax or $0.12
per  share) of charges  included  in 1996 as a result of the  decisions  made to
dispose of PepsiCo's non-core U.S. restaurant businesses. See Note 3.

(a)     Included  unusual  impairment,  disposal and other charges of $822 ($716
        after-tax or $0.45 per share).  See Note 3. Also included the benefit of
        reduced  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  for the  first  three
        quarters of 1996 of $46 ($29  after-tax  or $0.02 per share) as a result
        of the  initial  impact  of  adopting  SFAS  121,  "Accounting  for  the
        Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
        Of" at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 1995. See (c) below.
(b)     Included a net   refranchising  gain of $99 ($61 after-tax or $0.04 per 
        share) and $55 ($29 after-tax or $0.02 per share) in 1996 and 1995, re-
        spectively.
(c)     Included the initial,  noncash  charge of $520 ($384  after-tax or $0.24
        per share)  upon  adoption  of SFAS 121 at the  beginning  of the fourth
        quarter.  As  a  result  of  the  reduced  carrying  amount  of  certain
        long-lived assets to be held and used in the business,  depreciation and
        amortization  expense  for the fourth  quarter  was  reduced by $21 ($15
        after-tax or $0.01 per share). See Note 4.
(d)     Included a benefit of changing to a  preferable  method for  calculating
        the market-related value of plan assets in 1994, which reduced full-year
        pension expense by $35 ($22 after-tax or $0.01 per share).
(e)     Fiscal years 1994 and 1988 each consisted of 53 weeks. Normally,  fiscal
        years consist of 52 weeks; however,  because the fiscal year ends on the
        last  Saturday  in  December,  a week is added  every 5 or 6 years.  The
        fifty-third  week  increased  1994  earnings by  approximately  $54 ($35
        after-tax  or $0.02 per share) and 1988  earnings by  approximately  $23
        ($16 after-tax or $0.01 per share).
(f)     Included a $30 charge  ($0.02 per share) to increase  net  deferred  tax
        liabilities  as of the  beginning of 1993 for a 1% statutory  income tax
        rate increase due to 1993 U.S. Federal tax legislation.
(g)     Included $193 ($129  after-tax or $0.08 per share) in unusual charges to
        reorganize and streamline worldwide beverages and certain  International
        snack foods operations.
(h)     Included increased postretirement benefits expense of $52 ($32 after-tax
        or $0.02  per  share)  as a result of  adopting  SFAS  106,  "Employers'
        Accounting for  Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions."  Included
        the impact of adopting SFAS 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes," which
        reduced pre-tax income by $21 and the provision for income taxes by $34.
(i)     Included  $170 in unusual  charges  ($120  after-tax or $0.07 per share)
        primarily to streamline  operations in worldwide  snack foods and KFC in
        the U.S.

        public share offering by BAESA, an  unconsolidated  franchised  bottling
        affiliate in South America. See Note 17. The $118 gain ($53 after-tax or
        $0.03 per share) in 1990 arose from an initial  public  offering  of new
        shares by an  unconsolidated  KFC joint  venture  in Japan and a sale by
        PepsiCo of a portion of its shares.
(l)     Represented  the  cumulative  effect  of  adopting  in  1994  SFAS  112,
        "Employers'  Accounting for Postemployment  Benefits," and changing to a
        preferable  method  for  calculating  the  market-related  value of plan
        assets  used in  determining  the  return-on-asset  component  of annual
        pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss subject
        to amortization (see Notes 13 and 15, respectively) and adopting in 1992
        SFAS 106 ($575 ($357  after-tax  or $0.22 per share)) and SFAS 109 ($571
        tax charge  ($0.35 per share)).  Prior years were not restated for these
        changes in accounting.
(m)     Defined as net cash  provided by  operating  activities  reduced by cash
        dividends  paid and adjusted  for the  following  investing  activities:
        capital spending, refranchising of restaurants, sales of property, plant
        and  equipment  and other,  net.  Cash flows  from other  investing  and
        financing activities,  which are not presented,  are an integral part of
        total cash flow activity.
(n)     See Net Income Per Share in Note 1.
(o)     Total debt includes  short-term  borrowings and long-term debt,  which 
        for 1987 through 1990 included a
        nonrecourse obligation.
(p)     The return on average  shareholders'  equity is calculated  using income
        from  continuing  operations  before  cumulative  effect  of  accounting
        changes.
(q)     The market net debt ratio  represents  net debt as a percent of net debt
        plus the market value of equity,  based on the year-end stock price. Net
        debt is total debt, which for this purpose includes the present value of
        long-term  operating  lease  commitments,   reduced  by  the  pro  forma
        remittance  of  investment  portfolios  held  outside the U.S.  For 1987
        through 1990, total debt was also reduced by the nonrecourse  obligation
        in the calculation of net debt.
(r)     The historical  cost net debt ratio  represents net debt (see (q) above)
        as a percent of capital employed (net debt, other liabilities,  deferred
        income taxes and shareholders' equity).
