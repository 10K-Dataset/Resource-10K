         OF SHAREHOLDERS




                                     PART I
ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

      PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and was
reincorporated   in  North  Carolina  in  1986.  Unless  the  context  indicates
otherwise,  when used in this Report the term  "PepsiCo"  shall mean the Company
and its divisions and subsidiaries. PepsiCo is engaged in the beverage and snack
food  businesses.  On October  6,  1997,  the  Company  spun off  certain of its
restaurant  businesses,   consisting  of  Pizza  Hut,  Taco  Bell  and  KFC,  to
shareholders as an independent publicly-traded company. In addition, in 1997 the
Company disposed of PFS, its restaurant  distribution operation and its non-core
restaurant businesses.

BEVERAGES

     PepsiCo's beverage  businesses,  which operate as Pepsi-Cola  Company,  are
comprised  of  two  business  units:  Pepsi-Cola  North  America  ("PCNA"),  and
Pepsi-Cola Company International ("PCI").

      PCNA manufactures and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks and
soft  drink  concentrates,  in the  United  States  and  Canada.  PCNA sells its
concentrates to licensed bottlers  ("Pepsi-Cola  bottlers").  Under appointments
from PepsiCo,  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers  manufacture,  sell and  distribute,  within
defined territories, soft drinks and syrups bearing trademarks owned by PepsiCo,
including  PEPSI-COLA,  DIET PEPSI,  MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL SPORT and,
within  Canada,  7UP and DIET 7UP (these  products are sometimes  referred to as
"Pepsi-Cola  beverages").  The Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership,  a joint venture of
PCNA and Lipton,  develops and sells tea concentrate to Pepsi-Cola  bottlers and
develops and markets  ready-to-drink  tea products  under the LIPTON  trademark.
Such products are  distributed  by  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers  throughout  the United
States and Canada.

      Pepsi-Cola  beverages are manufactured in approximately 165 plants located
throughout the United States and Canada. PCNA operates  approximately 60 plants,
and manufactures,  sells and distributes beverages throughout  approximately 450
licensed  territories,  accounting  for  approximately  60%  of  the  Pepsi-Cola
beverages  sold in the United  States and Canada.  Approximately  105 plants are
operated  by  independent   licensees  or   unconsolidated   affiliates,   which
manufacture,  sell and distribute  approximately 40% of the Pepsi-Cola beverages
sold in the United States and Canada. PCNA has a minority interest in 8 of these
licensees, comprising approximately 70 licensed territories.

      PCI  manufactures and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks and
soft drink  concentrates,  outside the United  States and Canada.  PCI sells its
concentrates to Pepsi-Cola bottlers. Under appointments from PepsiCo, Pepsi-Cola
bottlers manufacture, sell and distribute, within defined territories, beverages
bearing PEPSI-COLA,  7UP, MIRINDA, DIET PEPSI, PEPSI MAX, MOUNTAIN DEW, DIET 7UP
and other trademarks. PCI operates 37 plants bottling PepsiCo beverage products.
There  are  approximately  275  plants  operated  by  independent  licensees  or
unconsolidated   affiliates  bottling  PepsiCo's  beverage  products  which  are
available in 186 countries and territories outside the United States and Canada.
Principal international markets include Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom.



      PCNA and PCI make  programs  available  to  assist  licensed  bottlers  in
servicing  markets,  expanding  operations and improving  production methods and
facilities.  PCNA and PCI also offer  assistance to  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers in the
distribution, advertising and marketing of PepsiCo's beverage products and offer
sales assistance through special  merchandising and promotional  programs and by
training bottler  personnel.  PCNA and PCI maintain control over the composition
and quality of beverages sold under PepsiCo trademarks.

SNACK FOODS

      PepsiCo's snack food businesses,  which operate as The Frito-Lay  Company,
are   comprised  of  Frito-Lay   North  America   ("Frito-Lay")   and  Frito-Lay
International ("FLI").

      Frito-Lay  manufactures  and  sells a  varied  line of salty  snack  foods
throughout  the United  States and Canada,  including  LAY'S and  RUFFLES  brand
potato  chips,  DORITOS and TOSTITOS  brand  tortilla  chips,  FRITOS brand corn
chips,  CHEEoTOS  brand cheese  flavored  snacks,  ROLD GOLD brand  pretzels and
SUNCHIPS brand multigrain snacks.

      Frito-Lay's  products are  transported  from its  manufacturing  plants to
major  distribution  centers,  principally by  company-owned  trucks.  Frito-Lay
utilizes a "store-door-delivery" system, whereby its approximately 20,000 person
sales force delivers the snacks directly to the store shelf. This system permits
Frito-Lay to work  closely with  approximately  500,000  retail trade  customers
weekly and to be  responsive  to their needs.  Frito-Lay  believes  this form of
distribution  is a  valuable  marketing  tool and is  essential  for the  proper
distribution of products with a short shelf life.

      FLI's  products are available in 111  countries  outside the United States
and Canada through company-owned  facilities and unconsolidated  affiliates.  On
most of the European continent,  PepsiCo's snack food business consists of Snack
Ventures  Europe,  a joint venture between  PepsiCo and General Mills,  Inc., in
which  PepsiCo  owns a 60%  interest.  FLI also  sells a variety  of snack  food
products  which appeal to local tastes  including,  for example,  WALKERS  brand
snack  foods,  sold in the United  Kingdom,  WEDEL brand sweet  snacks,  sold in
Poland,  and GAMESA brand cookies and ALEGRO brand sweet snacks,  which are sold
in Mexico. In addition, RUFFLES, LAY'S, CHEEoTOS, DORITOS, FRITOS, TOSTITOS, and
SUNCHIPS brand salty snack foods have been introduced to international  markets.
Principal  international  markets include Brazil,  France,  Mexico,  Poland, the
Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom.

COMPETITION

      Both of PepsiCo's  businesses are highly competitive.  PepsiCo's beverages
and snack foods  compete in the United  States and  internationally  with widely
distributed  products of a number of major companies that have plants in many of
the areas  PepsiCo  serves,  as well as with private label soft drinks and snack
foods and with the products of local and regional  manufacturers.  For PepsiCo's
industry segments,  the main areas of competition are price, quality and variety
of products, and customer service.




EMPLOYEES

      At December 27, 1997,  PepsiCo employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,
approximately   142,000  persons  (including   approximately   12,000  part-time
employees),   of  whom  approximately  79,000  (including  approximately  10,000
part-time  employees) were employed within the United States.  PepsiCo  believes
that its relations with employees are generally good.

RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER SUPPLIES

      The  principal  materials  used by PepsiCo in its  beverage and snack food
businesses are corn  sweeteners,  sugar,  aspartame,  flavorings,  vegetable and
essential oils, potatoes, corn, flour, seasonings and packaging materials. Since
PepsiCo  relies on trucks to move and distribute  many of its products,  fuel is
also an important  commodity.  PepsiCo  employs  specialists to secure  adequate
supplies  of many  of  these  items  and has  not  experienced  any  significant
continuous  shortages.  Prices  paid by PepsiCo  for such  items are  subject to
fluctuation. When prices increase, PepsiCo may or may not pass on such increases
to its  customers.  Generally,  when  PepsiCo  has  decided to pass along  price
increases, it has done so successfully.  There is no assurance that PepsiCo will
be able to do so in the future.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

      The conduct of PepsiCo's businesses, and the production,  distribution and
use of many of its products,  are subject to various  federal laws,  such as the
Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act, the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act and the
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act. The conduct of PepsiCo's  businesses is also
subject to state, local and foreign laws.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES

      PepsiCo owns numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to PepsiCo's
worldwide  businesses,  including  PEPSI-COLA,  PEPSI,  DIET  PEPSI,  PEPSI MAX,
MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG,  ALL SPORT,  7UP and DIET 7UP  (outside  the United
States),  MIRINDA,   FRITO-LAY,   LAY'S,  DORITOS,  RUFFLES,  TOSTITOS,  FRITOS,
CHEEoTOS, CRACKER JACK, ROLD GOLD, SUNCHIPS, SANTITAS,  SMARTFOOD,  SABRITAS and
WALKERS.  Trademarks  remain  valid  so long  as  they  are  used  properly  for
identification  purposes,  and PepsiCo emphasizes correct use of its trademarks.
PepsiCo has authorized (through licensing or franchise  arrangements) the use of
many of its trademarks in such contexts as Pepsi-Cola bottling  appointments and
snack  food  joint  ventures.  In  addition,  PepsiCo  licenses  the  use of its
trademarks on  collateral  products for the primary  purpose of enhancing  brand
awareness.

     PepsiCo either owns or has licenses to use a number of patents which relate
to certain of its products and the  processes  for their  production  and to the
design and operation of various equipment used in its businesses.  Some of these
patents are licensed to others.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      PepsiCo  continues to make  expenditures  in order to comply with federal,
state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations,  which expenditures
have not been  material  with respect to  PepsiCo's  capital  expenditures,  net
income or competitive position.



BUSINESS SEGMENTS

      Information as to net sales, operating profit and identifiable assets for
each of PepsiCo's industry segments and major geographic areas of operations, as
well  as  capital  spending,  acquisitions  and  investments  in  unconsolidated
affiliates,  amortization of intangible assets and depreciation expense for each
industry  segment  for 1997,  1996 and 1995 is  contained  in Item 8  "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data" in Note 17 on page F-23.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

BEVERAGES

      PepsiCo's  beverage  business operates 111 plants throughout the world, of
which 93 are owned and 18 are  leased,  and  unconsolidated  affiliates  operate
approximately  74 plants.  In addition,  PepsiCo's  beverage  business  operates
approximately  365  warehouses  or offices in the United  States and Canada,  of
which approximately 250 are owned and approximately 115 are leased.

      PepsiCo owns a research and technical facility in Valhalla,  New York, for
its beverage businesses.  PepsiCo also owns the headquarters  facilities for its
beverage  businesses  in  Somers,  New York.  PepsiCo is seeking a buyer for the
Somers  facility,  and certain  departments of the beverage  businesses  will be
moving to Purchase, New York to share the corporate headquarters building.

SNACK FOODS

      Frito-Lay  operates 55 food  manufacturing  and  processing  plants in the
United States and Canada,  of which 49 are owned and 6 are leased.  In addition,
Frito-Lay owns 182 warehouses and distribution  centers and leases approximately
40  warehouses  and  distribution  centers for  storage of food  products in the
United States and Canada.  Approximately  1,675 smaller  warehouses  and storage
spaces  located  throughout  the  United  States and Canada are leased or owned.
Frito-Lay  owns its  headquarters  building  and a research  facility  in Plano,
Texas.  Frito-Lay  also  leases  offices  in  Dallas,  Texas and  leases or owns
sales/regional  offices  throughout  the  United  States.  PepsiCo's  snack food
businesses  also  operate   approximately  70  plants  and   approximately   930
distribution  centers,  warehouses and offices  outside of the United States and
Canada.

GENERAL

      The Company owns its  corporate  headquarters  buildings in Purchase,  New
York.

      With a few  exceptions,  leases of plants in the United  States and Canada
are on a long-term basis,  expiring at various times,  with options to renew for
additional periods. Most international plants are leased for varying and usually
shorter periods, with or without renewal options.

      PepsiCo  believes that its properties are in good operating  condition and
are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.




ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      PepsiCo  is  subject  to  various  claims  and  contingencies  related  to
lawsuits,  taxes,  environmental  and other  matters  arising  out of the normal
course of business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, of
the claims and  contingencies  in excess of amounts already provided for, is not
likely  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of
operations or financial condition.

ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS

      Not applicable.

INTRODUCTION

Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  presented  in  four  sections.  The
introductory  section discusses the 1997 Disposal of the Restaurants Segment and
two pervasive issues impacting many companies,  Market Risk and Year 2000 (pages
9-11).  The  second  section  analyzes  the  Results of  Operations,  first on a
consolidated basis and then for each of our two



industry segments (pages 11-23). The final two sections address our consolidated
Cash Flows and Liquidity and Capital Resources (pages 23-26).

Cautionary Statements
From time to time,  in written  reports  and oral  statements,  we  discuss  our
expectations  regarding  PepsiCo's future  performance.  These  "forward-looking
statements" are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic
data and our operating plans. They are also inherently uncertain,  and investors
must  recognize  that events could turn out to be  significantly  different from
what we expect.

Disposal of the Restaurants Segment

On August 14, 1997 we announced  that our Board of  Directors  approved a formal
plan to spin off our restaurant businesses to our shareholders.  Under the plan,
owners of PepsiCo  capital  stock as of September 19, 1997 received one share of
common stock of the new  restaurant  company,  TRICON Global  Restaurants,  Inc.
(TRICON),  for every ten shares of  PepsiCo  capital  stock.  The  spin-off  was
completed on October 6, 1997 (Distribution  Date). In 1997, we also sold PepsiCo
Food  Systems  (PFS),  the  restaurant  distribution  operation  and  all of the
non-core U.S. restaurant businesses. As a result, the sales, costs and expenses,
assets and  liabilities,  and cash flows of the  Restaurants  segment  have been
classified as discontinued  operations in our financial statements.  See Note 4.
Accordingly,  the discussions that follow focus on the continuing  operations of
our packaged goods businesses.

Market Risk

The principal  market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes
in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are:
   - interest rates on our debt and short-term investment portfolios;
   - foreign exchange rates, generating translation and transaction gains and
     losses and
   - commodity prices, affecting the cost of our products.

Interest Rates

PepsiCo  centrally  manages  its  debt  and  investment  portfolios  considering
investment  opportunities  and risks,  tax  consequences  and overall  financing
strategies.

         We use  interest  rate and  currency  swaps to  effectively  change the
interest  rate and currency of specific  debt  issuances  with the  objective of
reducing our overall  borrowing  costs.  These swaps are generally  entered into
concurrently  with the  issuance of the debt they are  intended  to modify.  The
notional  amount,  interest  payment and  maturity  dates of the swaps match the
principal, interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt. Accordingly,
any market  risk or  opportunity  associated  with these  swaps is offset by the
opposite market impact on the related debt.

         Our investment  portfolios  consist of cash  equivalents and short-term
marketable  securities;  accordingly,  the carrying amounts  approximate  market
value. It is our practice to hold these investments to maturity.




     Assuming  year-end  1997  variable  rate  debt  and  investment  levels,  a
one-point  change in interest  rates would  impact net  interest  expense by $13
million.

Foreign Exchange

Operating  in  international  markets  sometimes  involves  exposure to volatile
movements in currency  exchange rates. The economic impact of currency  exchange
rate  movements  on us is  complex  because  such  changes  are often  linked to
variability in real growth, inflation,  interest rates, governmental actions and
other factors.  These changes, if material, can cause us to adjust our financing
and  operating  strategies.  Consequently,  isolating  the  effect of changes in
currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors.

         International  operations  constitute  about  16%  percent  of our 1997
consolidated  operating  profit,  excluding  unusual items. As currency exchange
rates  change,  translation  of  the  income  statements  of  our  international
businesses into U.S. dollars affects  year-over-year  comparability of operating
results.  We do not generally  hedge  translation  risks because cash flows from
international  operations are generally reinvested locally. We do not enter into
hedges to minimize  volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it
is justified by the exposure or the cost.

         Changes in currency  exchange  rates that would have the largest impact
on  translating  our  international  operating  profit include the Mexican peso,
British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. We estimate that a 10% change
in foreign  exchange rates would impact reported  operating  profit by less than
$50 million.  This represents 10% of the international  segment operating profit
(disclosed on page F-27) after adjusting for unusual items. We believe that this
quantitative measure has inherent limitations because, as discussed in the first
paragraph  of this  section,  it does not take  into  account  any  governmental
actions or changes in either customer  purchasing  patterns or our financing and
operating strategies.

         Foreign exchange gains and losses reflect  transaction gains and losses
and  translation  gains and  losses  arising  from the  remeasurement  into U.S.
dollars  of the  net  monetary  assets  of  businesses  in  highly  inflationary
countries.   Transaction  gains  and  losses  arise  from  monetary  assets  and
liabilities  denominated in currencies  other than a business unit's  functional
currency.  Net  foreign  exchange  gains and  losses  were not  material  to our
earnings for the last three years.

         The sensitivity analyses presented in the interest and foreign exchange
discussions  above  disregard  the  possibility  that rates can move in opposite
directions  and that gains from one  category may or may not be offset by losses
from another category and vice versa.

Commodities

We are subject to market risk with respect to commodities because our ability to
recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate.  We use futures  contracts to hedge  immaterial
amounts of our commodity purchases.


Year 2000

The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer  programs  using two digits rather
than  four  to  define  the  applicable  year.   Computer   programs  that  have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than the year 2000.  This could  result in system  failures  or  miscalculations
leading to disruptions in a company's operations.  If either we, our significant
customers or suppliers fail to correct Year 2000 issues, such failure could have
a  significant  impact on our ability to operate our  businesses.  However,  the
impact cannot be quantified at this time.

         We are in the  process of taking  actions to address and  complete  the
work associated with the Year 2000. Each of our business  segments and Corporate
have  established  teams to identify  and  correct  Year 2000  issues.  Internal
software  with  non-compliant  code is  expected  to be fixed or  replaced  with
software  that is Year  2000  compliant.  Similar  attention  is being  given to
technology  infrastructures,  manufacturing  plants and building  facilities  to
achieve  compliance  in all  these  areas.  The  teams  are  also  charged  with
investigating  the Year 2000  capabilities  of  suppliers,  customers  and other
external entities, and with developing contingency plans where necessary.

         An inventory  and  assessment of all computer  systems and  application
software have been completed,  and plans for  establishing  compliance have been
developed in the U.S.  These plans  identify  which  non-compliant  hardware and
software  will be  corrected,  upgraded or replaced;  the timetable and resource
requirements  to  achieve  those  objectives  and  estimated  associated  costs.
Remediation  and  testing  activities  are  under  way at  both  Pepsi-Cola  and
Frito-Lay.  Most  of our  larger  international  operations  have  made  similar
progress,  while  some  of  our  smaller  international  operations,  which  are
generally less automated, are still developing their strategies.

         We do not expect Year 2000 spending to materially  affect  consolidated
profitability or liquidity.  This expectation assumes that our existing forecast
of costs to be incurred  contemplates all significant  actions required and that
we will not be obligated to incur  significant Year 2000 related costs on behalf
of our  customers  or  suppliers.  About  40% of the  total  estimated  spending
represents  replacement  systems that, in addition to being Year 2000 compliant,
provide  significantly  enhanced  capability  which will benefit  operations  in
future years.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Review

Net Sales rose $580 million or 3% in 1997,  reflecting  volume gains,  partially
offset by the impact of unfavorable  currency  translation.  Net sales rose $1.3
billion or 7% in 1996,  reflecting  net volume  gains and higher  effective  net
pricing  (including  the effect of product,  package and country mix) in both of
our  business  segments.  These gains were  partially  offset by an  unfavorable
foreign currency  translation impact.  Volume gains in both years were driven by
worldwide Snack Foods and North American Beverages.



Cost of sales as a percent of net sales  decreased .8 of a point to 40.8 percent
in 1997,  primarily  reflecting  favorable raw material  costs in  International
Beverages  and, the  leveraging  effect of higher  pricing  partially  offset by
increased  costs for new plant  capacity  and the  planned  introduction  of new
products in 1998 by North  American  Snack Foods.  Cost of sales as a percent of
net sales decreased .6 of a point to 41.6 percent in 1996 primarily due to lower
raw materials  costs in North  American  Beverages  coupled with the  leveraging
effect of the higher effective net pricing.

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  (SG&A)  comprises  selling and
distribution  expenses (S&D),  advertising and marketing expenses (A&M), general
and administrative expenses (G&A), other income and expense and equity income or
loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. In 1997, SG&A grew 2%, or at
a slower  rate than  sales.  This  primarily  reflects  equity  income  from our
investments in unconsolidated affiliates, compared to losses a year ago, and A&M
growing at a significantly  slower rate than sales.  The change in equity income
primarily reflects the absence of losses from our Latin American bottler, Buenos
Aires  Embotelladora  S.A. (BAESA).  G&A grew  significantly  faster than sales,
reflecting  information  systems-related  expenses,  customer  focus  leadership
training and  infrastructure  costs related to our new fountain  beverage  sales
team.  These  increased  expenses were partially  offset by savings from a prior
year restructuring and the consolidation of certain administrative functions.

         In  1996,  A&M and S&D  grew  faster  than net  sales,  driving  an 11%
increase  in  SG&A,  led by  International  Beverages.  Equity  losses  from our
unconsolidated affiliates,  compared to equity income in 1995, primarily reflect
our share of operating losses from BAESA.

Amortization  of  intangible  assets  declined 3% to $199 million and 1% to $206
million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Unusual  items of $290 million  ($239  million  after-tax or $0.15 per share) in
1997 and $576 million ($527 million after-tax or $0.33 per share) in 1996 relate
to  decisions  to dispose of and write down  assets,  improve  productivity  and
strengthen the international  bottler structure.  See Note 2. The 1995 charge of
$66 million ($64 million  after-tax or $0.04 per share) is the initial,  noncash
impairment charge upon adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
No. 121 (SFAS 121),  "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." See Note 3.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1997,  reported  operating profit increased $622 million.  Ongoing  operating
profit increased $336 million reflecting segment operating profit growth of $392
million or 14%, partially offset by a $56 million or 32% increase in unallocated
expenses. The increase in segment operating profit primarily reflects the volume
gains and lower raw  material  costs in  worldwide  Beverages.  The  increase in
unallocated  expenses relates to higher corporate  expenses and foreign exchange
losses in 1997 compared to gains in 1996.

         In 1996,  reported  operating  profit  declined $566  million.  Ongoing
operating  profit  decreased $56 million due to a $30 million or 21% increase in
unallocated  expenses and a combined  segment  operating  profit decrease of $26
million  or  1%.  The  increased   unallocated   expenses  relate  to  centrally
administered benefit plans and higher corporate expenses. The decline in segment
operating  profit  reflects  increased  costs in excess of higher  effective net
pricing,  partially  offset by volume  gains.  The  change  in  ongoing  segment
operating profit also includes unfavorable currency translation impacts.

Interest expense, net of interest income, declined $121 million or 26%. Interest
expense declined $87 million or 15% in 1997,  primarily reflecting lower average
U.S.  debt levels.  Debt levels were  reduced  using a portion of the cash flows
provided  by  discontinued   operations  and  proceeds   repatriated   from  our
investments  in Puerto Rico.  The  repatriation  of funds  resulted  from a 1996
change in tax law which  eliminated  a tax  exemption  on  investment  income in
Puerto Rico.  Interest  income  increased $34 million or 37%  reflecting  higher
average  investment  levels,  which also  benefited  from cash flows provided by
discontinued operations.

         Interest expense,  net of interest income in 1996 declined $41 million
or 8%, reflecting lower  international  debt levels and U.S. interest rates.

__________________________________________________________________

Our 1997 reported  effective tax rate decreased 4.4 points to 35.4%. Our ongoing
effective  tax rate  increased  2.0 points to 33.4%,  primarily  reflecting  the
absence of  cumulative  tax  credits  recognized  in 1996 that  related to prior
years,  lower benefits in 1997 from the current year  resolution of prior years'
audit issues and other individually immaterial items.

        Our 1996 reported  effective tax rate increased 7.8 points to 39.8%. Our
ongoing  effective  tax rate  remained  about  even with the prior year as lower
benefits  from the current  year  resolution  of prior  years' audit issues were
offset  by  the  cumulative  tax  credits  related  to  prior  years  and  other
individually immaterial items.

NM - Not Meaningful
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

System bottler case sales (BCS) is our standard  volume  measure.  It represents
PepsiCo-owned  brands  as well as  brands  we have  been  granted  the  right to
produce, distribute and market nationally.


                                  1997 vs. 1996
North America

Net sales  increased $118 million  reflecting  volume  growth,  led by take-home
packaged products, partially offset by lower effective net pricing. The decrease
in  effective  net  pricing  was  primarily  in  take-home   packaged  products,
reflecting an intensely competitive environment.

         BCS  increased  4%,  primarily  reflecting  double-digit  growth by the
Mountain Dew brand.  Non-carbonated soft drink products, led by Aquafina bottled
water and  Lipton  Brisk  tea,  grew at a  double-digit  rate.  Our  concentrate
shipments to franchisees  grew at a slower rate than their BCS growth during the
year.



         Reported  operating  profit  declined $115 million.  Ongoing  operating
profit declined $63 million,  reflecting the lower effective net pricing, higher
S&D costs and increased A&M. S&D grew  significantly  faster than sales,  but in
line with volume. A&M grew significantly faster than sales and volume, primarily
reflecting above average levels of expenditures  late in 1997. These unfavorable
items  were  partially  offset  by the  volume  gains and  lower  packaging  and
commodity costs. G&A savings from centralizing certain administrative  functions
were fully offset by Year 2000  spending and  infrastructure  development  costs
related  to our new  fountain  beverage  sales  team.  The  decline  in  ongoing
operating profit also reflects lapping 1996 gains from the sale of an investment
in a bottling cooperative and a settlement made with a supplier.

International

Net sales  declined $164 million.  The decline was due to  unfavorable  currency
translation  effects,  primarily  driven by Spain and Japan.

         BCS increased 1%. Strong  double-digit growth in China, the Philippines
and India was partially offset by double-digit declines in Brazil, Venezuela and
South Africa.  The declines in Venezuela and South Africa  reflect the impact of
the unexpected loss of our bottler in August 1996 and the cessation of our joint
venture operation,  respectively.  In November 1996, we entered into a new joint
venture to replace  the  Venezuelan  bottler.  Total  concentrate  shipments  to
franchisees increased at about the same rate as their BCS.

         Reported  operating  losses  declined $693 million.  Ongoing  operating
results improved by $271 million,  reflecting a small profit in 1997 compared to
a loss in 1996.  The increase in ongoing  operating  results was driven by lower
manufacturing  costs,  reduced net losses from our investments in unconsolidated
affiliates  and lower G&A expenses.  Operating  results also  benefited from the
lapping of 1996's higher-than-normal  expenses from fourth quarter balance sheet
adjustments  and actions.  The lower  manufacturing  costs were primarily due to
favorable  raw  material  costs and lower  depreciation  resulting  from certain
businesses  held for  disposal.  The reduced net losses from our  unconsolidated
affiliates were primarily  driven by the absence of losses from BAESA. The lower
G&A expenses reflect savings from our fourth quarter 1996 restructuring of about
$70 million.



                                  1996 vs. 1995
North America

Net sales rose $307 million.  The gain reflects volume growth, led by carbonated
soft drink products, and higher effective net pricing.

         BCS increased 4%, with solid  increases in Brand Pepsi and the Mountain
Dew brand. Non-carbonated soft drink products, led by Aquafina bottled water and
Hawaiian Punch fountain  syrup,  grew at a  double-digit  rate. Our  concentrate
shipments to franchisees grew at a slightly faster rate than their BCS growth.

         Operating profit increased $174 million. The growth reflects the volume
gains,  lower product costs and the higher  effective net pricing.  A&M expenses
grew  significantly  faster  than  sales,  primarily  due  to  the  Pepsi  Stuff
promotion. S&D expenses grew at the same rate as sales and volume. Profit growth
was aided by  lapping  charges  taken in 1995,  primarily  for  losses on supply
contracts,   take-or-pay  co-packing  penalties  and  a  write  down  of  excess
co-packing  assets.  A 1996  gain on the  sale of an  investment  in a  bottling
cooperative  and a 1996  settlement  with a supplier for purchases made in prior
years also helped profit growth.

         Benefits  of  approximately  $130  million  related  to the  1992  U.S.
restructuring  were achieved in 1996 due to the centralization of purchasing and
improved   administrative  and  business   processes.   All  benefits  from  the
restructuring will be reinvested in the business.

International

In 1996 we began to  implement  a new  strategy  to focus on  building  our core
business  in markets  in which we are  already  strong  and in certain  emerging
markets. Decisions were made accordingly to dispose of certain businesses and to
restructure  operations,  resulting  in  unusual  impairment  and  restructuring
charges.  Liabilities  associated with the restructuring charge were expected to
be paid by the end of 1997 and the  restructuring was expected to generate about
$50 million in savings in 1997 and about $80 million a year thereafter.

         Net sales declined $187 million,  primarily due to unfavorable currency
translation  impacts  and  lower  volume.  The  volume  decline  reflects  lower
concentrate  shipments  to  franchisees,  partially  offset by  higher  packaged
product sales to retailers.

         BCS decreased 2%.  Excluding the impact of the  unexpected  loss of our
Venezuelan bottler, BCS declined 1%. A single-digit decline in Latin America was
partially  offset  by  strong  double-digit  growth  in  China  and  India.  Our
concentrate  shipments to franchisees  declined at a  significantly  faster rate
than their BCS decline.



         Reported  operating  results declined $958 million.  Ongoing  operating
results  declined $382 million.  The decline reflects  broad-based  increases in
A&M,  higher-than-normal  expenses from fourth quarter balance sheet adjustments
and  actions,  increased  net losses from our  unconsolidated  affiliates  and a
decline in volume. The increased net losses from our  unconsolidated  affiliates
were driven by our equity share of BAESA's operating losses.

Ongoing excludes unusual charges of $84 ($22-North  America,  $62-International)
in 1997 (see Note 2).  Unless  otherwise  noted,  operating  profit  comparisons
within the following discussions are based on ongoing operating profit.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pound and kilo sales are our standard volume measures. Pound and kilo growth are
reported on a systemwide basis, which includes both consolidated  businesses and
unconsolidated affiliates operating for at least one year.




                                  1997 vs. 1996
North America

Net sales grew $339  million  reflecting  increased  volume  and the  benefit of
higher pricing taken on most major brands late in 1996.

     Pound  volume  advanced  3%.  Growth of our core  brands,  excluding  their
low-fat and no-fat versions,  was led by high single-digit growth in Lay's brand
potato chips,  strong  double-digit  growth by Tostitos brand tortilla chips and
single-digit  growth by Doritos brand tortilla  chips.  Baked Lay's brand potato
crisps reported low double-digit  growth;  however, the remainder of our low-fat
and no-fat snacks business depressed the overall growth rate.

     Reported operating profit grew $128 million.  Ongoing operating profit rose
$150 million,  reflecting the higher pricing and volume growth, partially offset
by increased  manufacturing costs and G&A expenses. The increased  manufacturing
costs relate to new plant capacity and the planned  introduction of new products
in 1998. S&D grew slower than sales,  A&M was about even with prior year and G&A
increased significantly faster than sales reflecting information systems-related
expenses and customer focus  leadership  training.  Operating  profit growth was
hampered by lapping a 1996 gain from the sale of a non-core business.

International

Net sales increased $287 million  reflecting  volume gains and higher  effective
net pricing.

     Salty snack kilos rose 11%, led by strong  double-digit  growth by Sabritas
and our business in Brazil, while sweet snack kilos declined 5%, due to a market
contraction at Gamesa.

     Reported  operating profit decreased $28 million.  Ongoing operating profit
increased $34 million.  The increase  primarily  reflects volume gains partially
offset by increased  G&A. The higher  effective  net pricing was fully offset by
inflation-driven  higher operating and manufacturing costs, primarily in Mexico.
Ongoing  operating  profit also  benefited  from the gain on the sale of a flour
mill.

                                  1996 vs. 1995
North America

Net sales grew $755  million.  The increase  reflects  strong  volume growth and
higher  effective net pricing taken across all core brands in late 1995 and late
1996.

         Pound volume advanced 9%, reflecting  exceptional  performance from the
low-fat and no-fat  categories.  These  categories  contributed  over 45% of the
total pound  growth,  led by Baked  Lay's  brand  potato  crisps.  Core  brands,
excluding their low-fat and no-fat versions, had mid-single-digit  growth led by
double-digit  growth in Lay's brand potato chips and strong  double-digit growth
in Tostitos brand tortilla chips.



         Operating  profit grew $137 million.  The increase  reflects the volume
growth  and  the  higher  effective  net  pricing,   which  exceeded   increased
promotional  price  allowances  and  merchandising  support.  The growth rate of
promotional price allowances  moderated in the fourth quarter.  These gains were
partially  offset by higher  operating  and  manufacturing  costs and  increased
administrative expenses. The increased operating costs reflect increased S&D and
A&M.  S&D  and  manufacturing   costs  both  reflect  capacity  costs  and  some
inefficiencies  incurred  to  capture  the  volume  opportunities  created  when
Anheuser-Busch exited the salty snack food business.  These inefficiencies began
to moderate in the fourth quarter.  The increase in operating  expenses  coupled
with  higher G&A  expenses,  partially  reflect  investment  spending to sustain
strong volume growth.  This increased  investment  spending,  including costs of
developing and testing new products,  was partially offset by a gain on the sale
of a non-core business.

International

Net sales  increased $395 million.  This growth reflects  inflation-based  price
increases  in Mexico  and  volume  growth,  partially  offset by an  unfavorable
currency translation impact, led by the peso.

         Salty snack kilos rose 8%, reflecting  double-digit  growth at Sabritas
and strong single-digit growth in the U.K. Sweet snack kilos declined 2%, led by
a  single-digit  decline  at  Gamesa,  due  to  marketwide  contraction,  and  a
double-digit decline at Alegro, the sweet snack division of Sabritas.

         Operating  profit increased $45 million.  The increase  reflects higher
effective net pricing in advance of inflation-driven  product and operating cost
increases,  primarily in Mexico,  and the  increased  volumes.  These gains were
partially  offset by increased  administrative  expenses and the net unfavorable
currency  translation  impact.  A&M  expenses  increased,  partially  reflecting
investment in global advertising and design.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS

PepsiCo's 1997  consolidated  cash and cash  equivalents  increased $1.6 billion
over the prior year  reflecting  a  significant  increase  in cash  provided  by
discontinued  operations,  partially offset by increased cash outflows to reduce
debt, increase our investment portfolios and repurchase shares.

         Net cash  provided by operating  activities  rose $227 million or 7% to
$3.4 billion in 1997,  driven by increased income before all noncash charges and
credits.  Cash flow growth  from  operating  working  capital was reduced by the
year-over-year  change  in  accounts  payable  and  other  current  liabilities,
primarily due to lapping  restructuring  accruals recorded in the fourth quarter
of 1996.

         Net cash used for investing  activities  nearly doubled in 1997 to $2.1
billion,  primarily reflecting a $1.5 billion swing in our short-term investment
portfolio activity,  partially offset by $178 million of increased proceeds from
sales of businesses and reduced




capital  spending  of $124  million.  The  change in our  short-term  investment
portfolio  activity  primarily  reflects  investing  a portion of the cash flows
provided by discontinued  operations.  This compares to 1996 when we repatriated
the  proceeds  from our maturing  investments  in Puerto Rico as a result of the
Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. This tax law eliminated our exemption
from U.S. Federal income tax on investment  income generated in Puerto Rico. The
repatriated proceeds were used to reduce outstanding  commercial paper debt. The
cash  flow from  sales of  businesses  in 1997  primarily  reflects  the sale of
international bottling operations and our investment in a non-core international
snack food business.  Lower capital  spending was driven by North American Snack
Foods.  The decline  reflects the lapping of 1996 capital  spending  incurred to
capture volume opportunities  created when Anheuser-Busch exited the salty snack
food business,  partially offset by 1997 new product-related spending.  Spending
on  acquisitions  and  investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates is expected to
increase in 1998.

         Net cash  used for  financing  activities  more  than  doubled  to $6.0
billion in 1997. The increase  primarily  reflects increased net debt repayments
of $2.5 billion and share repurchases.

At December  27,  1997,  132 million  shares  were  available  under the current
repurchase authority granted by our Board of Directors.

         Net cash  flow  provided  by  discontinued  operations  increased  $5.6
billion in 1997. The significant increase primarily reflects a $4.5 billion cash
distribution  received  from TRICON just prior to the  Restaurant  spin-off.  In
addition,  it reflects  after-tax cash proceeds of $1.0 billion  associated with
the sale of PFS and the  non-core  U.S.  restaurant  businesses,  the effects of
refranchising restaurants and other operating activities.



Free Cash Flow

Free  cash  flow is a  measure  we use  internally  to  evaluate  our cash  flow
performance  and should be  considered  in addition  to, but not as a substitute
for,  other  measures of financial  performance  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles.  These funds  provide us with  flexibility  to
reduce our debt outstanding, repurchase shares or make strategic investments and
acquisitions.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The $6.3  billion  increase  in free  cash  flow in 1997  largely  reflects  our
strategic  initiative to exit the restaurant  business.  In addition,  free cash
flow from  continuing  operations  nearly  doubled with improved cash flows from
operating  activities,  larger proceeds  arising from the sale of businesses and
reduced  capital   spending.   Both  continuing  and   discontinued   operations
contributed to the $268 million or 25% increase in the 1996 free cash flow.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At year-end 1997,  $2.1 billion of short-term  borrowings  were  reclassified as
long-term,  reflecting  our intent and  ability,  through the  existence  of our
unused revolving credit  facilities,  to refinance these borrowings.  Our unused
credit  facilities,  which exist  largely to support the issuances of short-term
debt,   were  $2.75  billion  and  $3.5  billion  at  year-end  1997  and  1996,
respectively. Annually, these facilities can be extended an additional year upon
the mutual  consent of PepsiCo  and the  lending  institutions.  We reduced  our
credit  facilities by $750 million at year-end  1997 due to decreased  borrowing
needs.

         Our net  debt  level,  which  reflects  the  pro  forma  remittance  of
investment  portfolios  (net of related taxes) as a reduction of total debt, and
leverage  at year-end  1997 were lower than prior  years.  We plan to  gradually
releverage over time.

         Our strong  cash-generating  capability and financial condition give us
ready access to capital markets throughout the world.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts; all per share
amounts assume dilution)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The  preparation of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
     Certain  reclassifications  were made to prior year amounts to conform with
the  1997  presentation,   including  classifying  our  Restaurants  segment  as
discontinued  operations.  The consolidated  financial  statements for all years
have been restated. See Note 4.
     Principles  of  Consolidation.   The  financial   statements   reflect  the
consolidated   accounts  of  PepsiCo,   Inc.  and  its  controlled   affiliates.
Intercompany  accounts and  transactions  have been  eliminated.  Investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates in which PepsiCo exercises  significant influence but
not control are accounted  for by the equity  method and PepsiCo's  share of the
net income or loss of its  unconsolidated  affiliates  is  included  in selling,
general and administrative expenses.
     Marketing  Costs.  Marketing  costs are  reported in  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses and include costs of  advertising  and other  marketing
activities.  Marketing  costs not  deferred at  year-end  are charged to expense
ratably  in  relation  to sales  over the  year in which  incurred.  Advertising
expenses  were $1.8  billion,  $1.8 billion and $1.4  billion in 1997,  1996 and
1995,  respectively.  Advertising  expenses  deferred  at  year-end,  which  are
classified  as prepaid  expenses in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  were $53
million and $37  million in 1997 and 1996,  respectively.  Deferred  advertising
consists  of  media  and  personal  service  advertising-  related  prepayments,
promotional  materials  in  inventory  and  production  costs  of  future  media
advertising; these assets are expensed in the year first used.
     Stock-Based Compensation. PepsiCo measures stock-based compensation cost as
the excess of the quoted  market price of PepsiCo's  capital  stock at the grant
date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock. PepsiCo's policy is to
generally  grant  stock  options  at fair  market  value at the  date of  grant;
accordingly, no compensation cost is incurred.
     Derivative Instruments. The interest differential to be paid or received on
an interest rate swap is recognized as an adjustment to interest  expense as the
differential  occurs.  The  interest  differential  not yet  settled  in cash is
reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a receivable or payable under the
appropriate  current  asset or  liability  caption.  If an  interest  rate  swap
position was to be terminated,  the gain or loss realized upon termination would
be deferred and  amortized to interest  expense over the  remaining  term of the
underlying  debt  instrument  it was  intended to modify or would be  recognized
immediately if the underlying debt instrument was settled prior to maturity.
     The  differential  to be paid or  received  on a currency  swap  related to
non-U.S. dollar denominated debt is charged or credited to income as the

F - 8

differential  occurs.  This is fully  offset by the  corresponding  gain or loss
recognized  in income on the currency  translation  of the debt, as both amounts
are based  upon the same  exchange  rates.  The  currency  differential  not yet
settled  in cash is  reflected  in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  under  the
appropriate  current or noncurrent  receivable or payable caption. If a currency
swap position was to be terminated prior to maturity,  the gain or loss realized
upon termination would be immediately recognized in income.
     Gains  and  losses  on  futures  contracts  designated  as hedges of future
commodity  purchases  are  deferred  and included in the cost of the related raw
materials  when  purchased.  Changes in the value of futures  contracts  used to
hedge commodity  purchases are highly  correlated to the changes in the value of
the  purchased  commodity.  If the degree of  correlation  between  the  futures
contracts and the purchased commodity were to ever significantly diminish during
the  contract  term,  subsequent  changes in the value of the futures  contracts
would be recognized in income.
     Cash Equivalents.  Cash equivalents  represent funds temporarily  invested,
with  original  maturities  not  exceeding  three  months,  as part of PepsiCo's
management of day-to-day  operating cash receipts and  disbursements.  All other
investment portfolios are primarily classified as short-term investments.
     Inventories.  Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the
average,  first-in,  first-out or last-in,  first-out  method) or net realizable
value.
     Property,  Plant and Equipment.  Property,  plant and equipment  (PP&E) are
stated at cost, except for PP&E that have been impaired,  for which the carrying

on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
     Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over appropriate periods, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years.
     Recoverability  of  Long-Lived  Assets to be Held and Used in the Business.
All long-lived  assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 121 (SFAS  121),  "Accounting  for the
Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of."
Assets are generally grouped at the country level, by segment, for this purpose.
     An impaired  asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based
on the best  information  available;  estimated  fair market  value is generally
measured by discounting  estimated  future cash flows.  Considerable  management
judgment is necessary  to estimate  discounted  future cash flows.  Accordingly,
actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.

The 1997 and 1996 unusual items include  impairment  charges of $200 million and
$373 million, respectively,  (see Note 3). The 1997 net charge to strengthen the
international bottler structure includes proceeds of $87 million associated with
a settlement  related to a previous  Venezuelan  bottler  agreement,  which were
partially offset by related costs.
     The 1995 initial,  noncash  charge  reflects the early adoption of SFAS 121
(see Note 3).

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The charges associated with assets to be held and used in the business reflect a
reduction  in  forecasted  cash  flows  attributable  to  increased  competitive
activity and weakened  macroeconomic  factors in various geographic regions. The
net charges for  disposal of assets  primarily  reflect  strategic  decisions to
realign the  international  bottling  system,  restructure  certain  Snack Foods
operations and exit certain businesses.  We anticipate the disposal of assets to
be completed in 1998.

F - 10

     PepsiCo early adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of
1995. The initial,  noncash charge  resulted from PepsiCo  grouping  assets at a
lower  level than  under its  previous  accounting  policy  for  evaluating  and
measuring impairment.


Note 4 - Discontinued Operations

The Restaurants segment was composed of the core restaurant  businesses of Pizza
Hut, Taco Bell and KFC, PepsiCo Food Systems (PFS), the restaurant  distribution
operation,  and several non-core U.S.  restaurant  businesses.  In 1997, PepsiCo
announced  its  intention  to  spin  off  its   restaurant   businesses  to  its
shareholders as an independent  publicly traded company  (Distribution) and sell
PFS separately. The spin-off was effective as a tax free Distribution on October
6, 1997 (Distribution Date). Owners of PepsiCo capital stock as of September 19,
1997  received  one share of common  stock of TRICON  Global  Restaurants,  Inc.
(TRICON),  the new company,  for every ten shares of PepsiCo capital stock. Just
prior to the  Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo  received  $4.5  billion in cash from
TRICON as repayment of certain amounts due and a dividend.  PFS and the non-core
U.S. restaurant businesses were sold prior to the Distribution Date resulting in
after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion.

Income from discontinued operations:

                                      1997        1996      1995
Net sales                          $ 8,375    $ 11,441  $ 11,328

The above amounts include costs directly associated with the spin-off but do not
include  an  allocation  of  PepsiCo  interest  or  general  and  administrative
expenses.


Note 5 - Income Per Share

PepsiCo  adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
No. 128, "Earnings Per Share," in 1997. Application of its provisions results in
disclosure of two income per share measures, basic and assuming dilution, on the
face of the Consolidated Statement of Income.

      PepsiCo's  reported  net income  represents  its net income  available  to
common  stockholders  for purposes of computing  both  measures.  The  following

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identifiable  intangible  assets primarily arise from the allocation of purchase
prices of businesses acquired. Amounts assigned to such identifiable intangibles
are based on independent  appraisals or internal estimates.  Goodwill represents
the residual purchase price after allocation to all identifiable net assets.
     The above amounts are net of accumulated  amortization  of $1.7 billion and
$1.5 billion at year-end 1997 and 1996, respectively.

The interest rates in the above table include the effects of associated interest

inherent  credit risk and fair value  information  related to debt and  interest
rate and currency swaps.

     The  following  table  indicates the notional  amount and weighted  average
interest rates, by category, of interest rate swaps outstanding at year-end 1997
and 1996,  respectively.  The  weighted  average  variable  interest  rates that
PepsiCo pays,  which are primarily  indexed to either  commercial paper or LIBOR
rates,  are  based on  rates as of the  respective  balance  sheet  date and are
subject to change. Terms of interest rate swaps match the terms of the debt they
modify. The swaps terminate at various dates through 2011.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------

At  year-end  1997,  approximately  77% of total debt was  exposed  to  variable
interest rates,  compared to 74% in 1996. In addition to variable rate long-term
debt, all debt with  maturities of less than one year is categorized as variable
for purposes of this measure.
     PepsiCo  enters  into  currency  swaps to hedge its  currency  exposure  on
certain  non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt.  At year-end  1997,  the aggregate
carrying  amount of the debt was $629  million and the  payables  under  related
currency  swaps were $104  million,  resulting in a net  effective  U.S.  dollar
liability  of $733  million  with a  weighted  average  interest  rate of  5.8%,
including the effects of related  interest  rate swaps.  At year-end  1996,  the
carrying  amount of this debt  aggregates  $1.8 billion and the  receivables and
payables  under related  currency  swaps  aggregate $54 million and $59 million,
respectively, resulting in a net effective U.S. dollar liability of $1.8 billion
with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%,  including the effects of related
interest rate swaps.
     At year-end 1997 and 1996,  PepsiCo's unused  revolving  credit  facilities
covering  potential   borrowings  aggregate  $2.75  billion  and  $3.5  billion,
respectively.  The 1997 facilities expire in 2002. These credit facilities exist
largely to support the issuances of short-term  borrowings and are available for
general corporate purposes.
     At year-end 1997 and 1996, $2.1 billion and $3.5 billion,  respectively, of
short-term  borrowings were classified as long-term debt,  reflecting  PepsiCo's
intent and ability,  through the existence of the unused credit  facilities,  to
refinance these borrowings.
     The  annual  maturities  of  long-term  debt  through  2002 are:  1998-$2.1
billion,  1999-$939 million, 2000-$746 million, 2001-$353 million and 2002- $330
million.

Note 11 - Financial Instruments

Derivative Instruments
PepsiCo's  policy  prohibits  the  use of  derivative  instruments  for  trading
purposes and PepsiCo has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
     PepsiCo's use of derivative  instruments  is primarily  limited to interest
rate and currency  swaps,  which are entered into with the objective of reducing
borrowing  costs.  PepsiCo  enters  into  interest  rate and  currency  swaps to
effectively  change the interest rate and currency of specific  debt  issuances.
These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt they are
intended to modify. The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity dates of
the swaps  match the  principal,  interest  payment  and  maturity  dates of the
related debt. Accordingly,  any market risk or opportunity associated with these
swaps is offset by the opposite  market  impact on the related  debt.  PepsiCo's
credit risk  related to  interest  rate and  currency  swaps is  considered  low
because they are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties,  are
generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.  See Note
10 for the  notional  amounts,  related  interest  rates and  maturities  of the
interest rate and currency  swaps.  See  Management's  Discussion and Analysis -
Market Risk beginning on page 9.

The carrying amounts in the above table are included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet  under  the  indicated  captions,   except  for  debt-related   derivative
instruments  (interest  rate and  currency  swaps),  which are  included  in the
appropriate  current  or  noncurrent  asset  or  liability  caption.  Short-term
investments  consist  primarily of debt  securities and have been  classified as
held-to-maturity. Noncurrent investments mature at various dates through 2000.
     Because  of  the  short  maturity  of  cash   equivalents   and  short-term
investments,  the carrying  amounts  approximate  fair value.  The fair value of
noncurrent  investments is based upon market quotes.  The fair value of debt and
debt-related  derivative  instruments  was  estimated  using  market  quotes and
calculations based on market rates.

Note 13 - Employee Stock Options

PepsiCo granted stock options to employees pursuant to three different incentive
plans - the SharePower Stock Option Plan (SharePower),  the Long- Term Incentive
Plan (LTIP) and the Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP). SharePower stock options
were  granted to  essentially  all  full-time  employees.  The number of options
granted was based on each  employee's  annual  earnings.  The options  generally
became exercisable  ratably over 5 years and had to be exercised within 10 years
of the grant date.


F - 17

    Under the SOIP and LTIP,  stock  options  were  granted to middle and senior
management employees,  respectively.  SOIP options were exercisable after 1 year
and had to be  exercised  within 10 years of the grant date.  Most LTIP  options
were  exercisable  after 4 years and had to be exercised  within 10 years of the
grant date.  In addition,  certain LTIP options  could be exchanged by employees
for a specified  number of performance  share units (PSUs) within 60 days of the
grant date. The value of a PSU was fixed at the value of a share of stock at the
grant date and vested 4 years from the grant date, contingent upon attainment of
prescribed  Corporate  performance goals. At year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995, there
were 801,000,  763,000 and 970,600 PSUs  outstanding,  respectively.  Payment of
PSUs are made in cash and/or stock as approved by the Compensation  Committee of
PepsiCo's Board of Directors. Amounts expensed in continuing operations for PSUs
were $4 million in both 1997 and 1996 and $5 million in 1995. At year-end  1997,
there were 41 million and 137 million shares  available for grant under the SOIP
and LTIP, respectively.

Without the effect of pro forma costs related to the modification of outstanding
options  arising  from the TRICON  spin-off,  pro forma  income from  continuing
operations is $1,436 million or $0.92 per share in 1997.
     The pro forma amounts  disclosed above are not fully  representative of the
effects of stock-based awards because they exclude the pro forma cost related to
the unvested stock options granted before 1995.
     The fair value of the  options  granted  (including  the  modification)  is
estimated using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model based on the following
weighted average assumptions:

                                         1997       1996      1995

Note 14 - Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

PepsiCo  provides  postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  eligible  retired
employees and their  dependents,  principally  in the U.S.  Retirees who have 10
years of service and attain age 55 while in service with PepsiCo are eligible to
participate in the  postretirement  benefit plans.  The plans are not funded and
include some retiree cost sharing beginning in 1993.
     Postretirement benefit expense for 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $34 million, $39
million and $36 million, respectively.

Postretirement benefit liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet:

                                                     1997       1996

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The discount rate  assumptions  used to compute the  accumulated  postretirement
benefit obligation were 7.4% and 7.8% in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
     Separate  assumed  health care cost trend rates are used for  employees who
retire before and after retiree cost sharing was introduced.  The assumed health
care cost trend rate for employees who retired  before cost sharing was 7.4% for
1998, declining gradually to 5.5% in 2005 and thereafter. For employees retiring
after  the  introduction  of cost  sharing,  the  trend  rate was 6.5% for 1998,
declining to zero in 2004 and thereafter.


Note 15 - Pension Plans

     PepsiCo  sponsors  noncontributory  defined  benefit pension plans covering
substantially  all  full-time  U.S.   employees  as  well  as  contributory  and
noncontributory  defined  benefit pension plans covering  certain  international
employees.  Benefits generally are based on years of service and compensation or
stated amounts for each year of service. PepsiCo funds the U.S. plans in amounts
not less than minimum statutory  funding  requirements nor more than the maximum
amount that can be deducted for U.S.  income tax purposes.  International  plans
are funded in amounts  sufficient to comply with local  statutory  requirements.
The plans' assets  consist  principally  of equity  securities,  government  and
corporate debt securities and other  fixed-income  obligations.  The U.S. plans'
assets include 11.7 million and 12.2 million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock in
1997 and 1996,  with a post-spin  adjusted market value of $436 million and $316
million,  respectively.  In the interest of maintaining an appropriate  level of
diversification  within the U.S.  plans'  asset  portfolio,  .5 million  and 1.5
million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock were sold during the 1997 and 1996 plan
years,  respectively.  Dividends on PepsiCo  capital  stock of $6 million and $5
million were received by the U.S. plans in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

Management is  responsible  for the  reliability of the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  related  notes,  which have been  prepared in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and include  amounts based upon our
estimates  and  assumptions,  as required.  The financial  statements  have been
audited and reported on by our independent auditors,  KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, who
were given free access to all  financial  records and  related  data,  including
minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors  and  Committees of the Board.
We believe that management representations made to the independent auditors were
valid and appropriate.
     PepsiCo  maintains a system of internal  control over financial  reporting,
designed to provide reasonable  assurance as to the reliability of the financial
statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
The system is supported by formal policies and  procedures,  including an active
Code of Conduct  program  intended  to ensure  employees  adhere to the  highest
standards of personal  and  professional  integrity.  PepsiCo's  internal  audit
function  monitors  and  reports  on the  adequacy  of and  compliance  with the
internal  control  system,   and  appropriate   actions  are  taken  to  address
significant  control  deficiencies  and other  opportunities  for  improving the
system as they are  identified.  The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors,
which is  composed  solely  of  outside  directors,  provides  oversight  to our
financial  reporting  process  and our  controls  to  safeguard  assets  through
periodic  meetings  with  our  independent   auditors,   internal  auditors  and
management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free access
to the Audit Committee.
     Although no cost-effective internal control system will preclude all errors
and  irregularities,  we believe our  controls as of December  27, 1997  provide
reasonable  assurance  that the financial  statements  are reliable and that our
assets are reasonably safeguarded.

Report of Independent Auditors


Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of  December  27,  1997 and  December  28, 1996 and the related
consolidated  statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each
of  the  years  in  the  three-year   period  ended  December  27,  1997.  These
consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of PepsiCo,  Inc.'s
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of PepsiCo,
Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December  27, 1997 and December 28, 1996,  and the
results  of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 27, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
     As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated  financial statements,  PepsiCo,
Inc. in 1995  adopted  the  provisions  of the  Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."

Selected Financial Data                                (Page 3 of 4)

(in millions except per share and employee amounts, unaudited)
PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PepsiCo  disposed of its  Restaurants  segment in 1997 and  accounted  for it as
discontinued  operations  (see Note 4); all  information  has been  reclassified
accordingly.  Additionally,  PepsiCo made  numerous  acquisitions  in most years
presented and a few  divestitures  in certain years.  Such  transactions  do not
materially  affect the  comparability  of  PepsiCo's  operating  results for the
periods  presented.  All share and per share amounts reflect a two-for-one stock
split  in  1996  and  per  share  amounts  are  computed  using  average  shares
outstanding, assuming dilution.

(a)  Includes  unusual items of $290 ($239  after-tax or $0.15 per share)in 1997
     and $576 ($527 after-tax or $0.33 per share) in 1996. See Note 2.
(b)  Includes the  initial,  noncash  charge of $66 ($64  after-tax or $0.04 per
     share) upon adoption of SFAS 121 at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
(c)  Includes the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 112 "Employers'  Accounting
     for Postemployment  Benefits" of $77 ($51 after-tax or $0.03 per share) and
     changing to a preferable method for calculating the market-related value of
     plan assets used in determining  the return-on-  asset  component of annual
     pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss subject to
     amortization  of $32 ($20 after- tax or $0.01 per share).  Prior years were
     not restated for these changes in accounting.
(d)  Includes a benefit of changing to the preferable method for calculating the
     market  value of plan  assets in 1994,  which  reduced  full  year  pension
     expense by $29 ($18 after-tax or $0.01 per share).
(e)  Fiscal year 1994 consists of 53 weeks. Normally, fiscal years consist of 52
     weeks;  however,  because  the  fiscal  year ends on the last  Saturday  in
     December,  a week is  added  every 5 or 6  years.  The  fifty-  third  week
     increased  1994 earnings by  approximately  $31 ($28 after-tax or $0.02 per
     share).
(f)  Defined as earnings before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization
     which is presented  net of the noncash  portion of unusual items of $233 in
     1997, $366 in 1996 and $66 in 1995.  EBITDA is used by certain investors as
     a  measure  of a  company's  ability  to  service  its  debt.  It should be
     considered in addition to, but not as a substitute  for,  other measures of
     financial  performance  in accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting
     principles (GAAP).
(g)  Defined  as net cash  provided  by  operating  activities  reduced  by cash
     dividends paid and adjusted for the following investing activities: capital
     spending,  sales of businesses,  sales of property, plant and equipment and
     other,  net. Free cash flow is a measure we use  internally to evaluate our
     cash flow performance and should be considered in addition to, but not as a
     substitute for, other measures of financial  performance in accordance with
     GAAP.
