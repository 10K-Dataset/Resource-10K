Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

”

Frito-Lay North America

Frito-Lay North
America (FLNA) manufactures or uses contract manufacturers, markets, sells and distributes branded snacks. These snacks include Lay’s potato chips, Doritos flavored tortilla chips, Tostitos tortilla chips, Cheetos cheese flavored snacks, Fritos
corn chips, Ruffles potato chips, branded dips, Rold Gold pretzels, Quaker Chewy granola bars, Sun Chips multigrain snacks, Munchies snack mix, Grandma’s cookies, Lay’s Stax potato crisps, Quaker Fruit & Oatmeal bars, Quaker Quakes

approximated 33% of our total division net revenue in 2004 and 34% of our total division net revenue in each of 2003 and 2002.


PepsiCo Beverages North America

PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA) manufactures or uses contract manufacturers, markets
and sells beverage concentrates, fountain syrups and finished goods, under various beverage brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana Pure Premium, Sierra Mist, Mug, Tropicana Juice Drinks, Propel, SoBe, Slice, Dole, Tropicana
Twister, and Tropicana Season’s Best. PBNA also manufactures, markets and sells ready-to-drink tea and coffee products through joint ventures with Lipton and Starbucks. In addition, PBNA licenses the Aquafina water brand to its bottlers and
markets this brand. PBNA sells concentrate and finished goods for some of these brands to bottlers licensed by us, and some of these branded products are sold directly by us to independent distributors and retailers. The franchise bottlers sell our
brands as finished goods to independent distributors and retailers. PBNA’s net revenue was $8.3 billion in 2004, $7.7 billion in 2003 and $7.2 billion in 2002 and approximated 28% of our total division net revenue in 2004 and 29% of our total
division net revenue in each of 2003 and 2002.

PepsiCo
International

PepsiCo International (PI) manufactures through
consolidated businesses as well as through noncontrolled affiliates, a number of leading salty and sweet snack brands including Gamesa and Sabritas in Mexico, Walkers in the United Kingdom, and Smith’s in Australia. Further, PI manufactures or
uses contract manufacturers, markets and sells many Quaker brand snacks. PI also manufactures, markets and sells beverage concentrates, fountain syrups and finished goods under the brands Pepsi, 7UP, Mirinda, Mountain Dew, Gatorade and Tropicana.
These brands are sold to franchise bottlers, independent distributors and retailers. However, in certain markets, PI operates its own bottling plants and distribution facilities. PI also licenses the Aquafina water brand to certain of its franchise
bottlers. PI’s net revenue was $9.9 billion in 2004, $8.7 billion in 2003 and $7.7 billion in 2002 and approximated 34% of our total division net revenue in 2004 and 32% of our total division net revenue in each of 2003 and 2002.

Quaker Foods North America

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) manufactures or uses contract manufacturers, markets and
sells cereals, rice, pasta and other branded products. QFNA’s products include Quaker oatmeal, Aunt Jemima mixes and syrups, Quaker grits, Cap’n Crunch and Life ready-to-eat cereals, Rice-A-Roni, Pasta Roni and Near East side dishes. These
branded products are sold to independent distributors and retailers. QFNA’s net revenue was $1.5 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002 and approximated 5% of our total division net revenue in each of those years.

Our Distribution Network

Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery, broker-warehouse and food
service and vending distribution networks. The distribution system used depends on


customer needs, product characteristics, and local trade practices. These distribution systems are described under the heading “

Our Business

” contained in “

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

”

Ingredients and Other Supplies

The principal ingredients we
use in our food and beverage businesses are almonds, aspartame, cocoa, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, juice and juice concentrates, oats, oranges, grapefruits and other fruits, potatoes, rice, seasonings, sugar, vegetable and essential
oils and wheat. Our key packaging materials include P.E.T. resin used for plastic bottles, film packaging used for snack foods and cardboard. Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities due to their use in our plants and in the trucks
delivering our products. These products are purchased mainly in the open market. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages. The prices we pay for such items
are subject to fluctuation. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. When we have decided to pass along price increases in the past, we have done so successfully. However, there is no assurance that we will be
able to do so in the future.

Our Brands

We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses,
including Alegro, AMP, Aquafina, Aunt Jemima, Cap’n Crunch, Cheetos, Cracker Jack, Diet Pepsi, Doritos, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Gamesa, Gatorade, Golden Grain, Grandma’s, Lay’s, Life, Mirinda, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mug, Near
East, Pasta Roni, Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Pepsi One, Pepsi Twist, Pepsi-Cola, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Quaker Quakes, Rice-A-Roni, Rold Gold, Ruffles, Sabritas, 7UP and Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Sierra Mist, Slice, Smith’s, Snack a
Jacks, SoBe, Sun Chips, Tostitos, Tropicana, Tropicana Pure Premium, Tropicana Season’s Best, Tropicana Twister, Walkers, Wild Cherry Pepsi and Wotsits. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and
we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of
our trademarks on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.

We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to some of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our
businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.

Seasonality

Our beverage and food divisions are subject to seasonal variations. Our
beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and certain food sales are higher in the cooler months. Weekly sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and


holiday-related patterns. However, taken as a whole, seasonality does not have a material impact on our business.

Our Customers

Our customers include franchise bottlers and independent distributors and retailers. We normally grant our bottlers exclusive contracts to
sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements specify the amount to be paid by our bottlers for concentrate and full goods and for Aquafina royalties, as well as the
manufacturing process required for product quality.

Sales to Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. represent approximately 11% of our total net revenue. Retail consolidation has increased the importance of major customers and further consolidation is expected. Our top five retail customers currently represent approximately 27% of our 2004
North American net revenue, with Wal-Mart representing approximately 14%. In addition, sales to The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) represent approximately 10% of our total net revenue. See

Note 8

to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our anchor bottlers.

Our Competition

Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete against global, regional and private label manufacturers on the basis of price, quality, product variety and effective distribution. Success in this
competitive environment is primarily achieved through effective promotion of existing products and the introduction of new products. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and
flexibility of our distribution network, allow us to compete effectively.

Frito-Lay holds a significant leadership market position in the snack industry worldwide and faces local and regional competitors as well as national and global snack competitors on issues related to price, quality, variety and
distribution. In the beverage industry, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary competitor. In the United States, The Coca-Cola Company has a slightly larger share of carbonated soft drink consumption, while we have a larger share for chilled juices
and isotonics. We also face many local value brand competitors in the United States. Internationally, The Coca-Cola Company has a significant market share advantage for carbonated beverages. In addition, internationally we compete with strong local
carbonated beverage brands in many countries. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, enable us to compete effectively.

The information in the charts above is based on Information Resources, Inc. and A.C. Nielsen Corporation reports that exclude Wal-Mart, as Wal-Mart does not report data to these
services.

Regulatory Environment

The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution, sale, advertising,
labeling, safety, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations
administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we operate. It is our policy to follow the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.

In the United States, we are required to comply with federal laws, such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Occupational Safety and
Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations.

In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special
importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.

We
rely on legal, operational and environmental compliance programs, as well as local in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business. The cost of
compliance with foreign laws does not have a material financial impact on our international operations.


Employees

As of December 25, 2004, we employed, subject to seasonal variations, approximately 153,000 people worldwide, including approximately 60,000 people employed within the
United States. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.

Item 2. Properties

We own our corporate
headquarters building in Purchase, New York. Leases of plants in North America generally are on a long-term basis, expiring at various times, with options to renew for additional periods. Most international plants are leased for varying and usually
shorter periods, with or without renewal options. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.

Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) owns or leases approximately 50 food manufacturing and processing plants and approximately 1,700 warehouses, distribution centers and
offices, including its headquarters building and a research facility in Plano, Texas.

PepsiCo Beverages North America

PepsiCo Beverages
North America (PBNA) owns or leases approximately 44 plants and production processing facilities and approximately 43 warehouses, distribution centers and offices, including its headquarters building in downtown Chicago, Illinois. Licensed bottlers
in which we have an ownership interest own or lease approximately 70 bottling plants.

PepsiCo International

or leases approximately 175 plants and approximately 1,500 warehouses, distribution centers and offices. PI is headquartered in the corporate facility in Purchase, NY.

headquartered in the same facility with PBNA in downtown Chicago, Illinois.

Shared Properties

Foods North America share approximately 7 plants and 4 distribution centers, warehouses and officers. FLNA, PBNA and QFNA share approximately 7 plants and 14 distribution centers, warehouses and offices in North America, including a research and
development laboratory in Barrington, Illinois.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are party to a
variety of legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business, including the matters discussed below. While the results of proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will
not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or cash flows.

On April 30, 2004, we announced that Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola Company received notification from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) indicating
that the SEC staff was proposing to recommend that the SEC bring a civil action alleging that a non-executive employee at Pepsi-Cola and another at Frito-Lay signed documents in early 2001 prepared by Kmart acknowledging payments in the amount of $3
million from Pepsi-Cola and $2.8 million from Frito-Lay. Kmart allegedly used these documents to prematurely recognize the $3 million and $2.8 million in revenue. Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola have cooperated fully with this investigation and provided
written responses to the SEC staff notices setting forth the factual and legal bases for their belief that no enforcement actions should be brought against Frito-Lay or Pepsi-Cola.

On November 5, 2003, we announced that Frito-Lay received notification from the SEC staff indicating that the staff was considering
recommending that the SEC bring a civil injunctive action against Frito-Lay and one of its non-executive sales employees who signed documents requested by The Fleming Companies in 2001-2002 involving payments of $400,000, which Fleming allegedly
used to accelerate its revenue recognition. On December 28, 2004, the SEC staff notified Frito-Lay that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against Frito-Lay in connection with the Fleming matter.

Based on an internal review of the Kmart and Fleming matters, no officers of PepsiCo,
Pepsi-Cola or Frito-Lay are involved. None of these matters involves any allegations regarding PepsiCo’s accounting for its transactions with Kmart or The Fleming Companies or PepsiCo’s financial statements.

Our Chairman and CEO Perspective

The
questions below reflect those commonly asked by our shareholders, and are followed by answers from our Chairman and CEO, Steve Reinemund.

How will you sustain growth?

By taking our competitive strengths, and investing in them to create longer-term value. That may sound a bit simplistic, but here’s what I mean.

PepsiCo has three key advantages:

1. big, muscular brands,

2. the proven ability to innovate and create differentiated products, and

3. powerful go-to-market systems.

What makes this all work are the extraordinarily talented, dedicated people at PepsiCo.

When we take those competitive advantages, and invest in them with dollars generated from top-line growth and cost saving initiatives, we
sustain a value cycle for our shareholders.

In essence, investing in
innovation fuels the building of our brands; this in turn drives top-line growth. Dollars from that top-line growth are strategically reinvested back into new products and other innovation, along with cost savings projects, and thus the cycle
continues.

Your cycle of reinvestment relies on your ability to grow
brands.  Are PepsiCo’s brands up to the challenge?

Yes. With 16 brands that each generate over a billion dollars of retail sales annually, and many more moving in that direction, we have big “global icon” brands that sit squarely in the sweet spot of convenience. We constantly
differentiate those brands in the marketplace by what we do with ingredients and nutrition science, product packaging and processing. And, we create points of difference with marketplace solutions in our retail environment, exciting the consumers
who ultimately buy our products.

We have more of these icon brands than any
other food and beverage company in the world, and we continue to add new products to the portfolio through internal innovations combined with smaller, tuck-in acquisitions with our international businesses.

How do you invest in, and differentiate, PepsiCo’s brands?

We invest in many ways, including advertising and merchandising. I’d say innovation is
the most impactful option. Innovation lives at the core of any successful consumer products company. Our organization is structured to capture consumer insights, and customer – or retailer – insights as well. Strategically, we look at
innovation in three


ways, or types. “Type A” innovation is what we call “close-in” – ideas like new flavors of existing products.

“Type B” innovation is represented in new products delivering additional benefits
or meeting specific consumer preferences, but generally within existing brands. For example, Tostitos Scoops tortilla chips, Lay’s Stax potato crisps or Tropicana Light ‘n Healthy beverages are products more incremental to the business
than Type A.

“Type C” innovation is focused on new platforms, like
delivering chilled products directly to the store; or entirely new products, like new Quaker Milk Chillers and Tropicana Fruit Integrity, which delivers a fruit serving in a new, fun snack format. These products are mostly incremental, and
we’ve centralized our research and development for this kind of innovation so we can put our resources into developing really big ideas.

Our goal is to incorporate more Type B and Type C innovation into our pipeline. In this way, we may have fewer new products every year, but more of our new product
revenues will be incremental. This has already been happening at Frito-Lay, with products like Lay’s Stax potato crisps.

On the beverage side, we are finding that “in-and-out” products – those with limited time availability – can create a lot of excitement and
incremental volume over a set time period. These products are relatively easy to develop, and we work closely with our bottling partners on the right timing. For example, in 2004, we introduced Mountain Dew Pitch Black just as Mountain Dew LiveWire
was winding down. Then, we introduced Pepsi Holiday Spice for the year-end holiday season. These all contribute to differentiating our brands.

You talked about innovation in terms of brands.  Are you innovating in other ways?

We’re innovating in ways that go beyond traditional brand ideas. For example, we look
at health and wellness as an opportunity to be an active part of the solution. We’ve improved the healthfulness of our existing products by taking important steps like eliminating trans fats in our Frito-Lay chips, reducing saturated fats in
Walkers crisps and reducing sugar in some food and beverage products in the United States and other markets. We’ve also developed new products that deliver more powerful health benefits, like Quaker Take Heart Oatmeal, which can help reduce
cholesterol and help maintain healthy blood pressure – two important factors for heart health. The Tropicana Pure Premium line of fortified orange juices is another great example. And we strengthened the Quaker snack line with products like new
soy crisps, and new or improved bar products.

In 2005, we’ll grow our
beverage portfolio with innovation in diet carbonated soft drinks. We’ll also add a new line of Gatorade Endurance Formula and Aquafina flavored waters in carbonated and non-carbonated varieties. With snacks, we’re relaunching Light
versions of our chips with reduced calories and fat.


As an umbrella logo that applies to more than 100 products in our portfolio, we’ve developed a new Smart Spot
trademark in the United States and Canada. The Smart Spot symbol helps consumers find our products that can contribute to healthier lifestyles. The Smart Spot program is based on authoritative statements from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Smart Spot products are the
fastest growing part of our North American product portfolio, with revenue growth approximately double that of our fun-for-you products. This strategic marketplace solution exists at the intersection of public interest and business interests, and we
intend to continue capturing growth through health and wellness solutions that address energy balance.

You’ve said PepsiCo’s health and wellness initiatives are based on the concept of “energy balance.” What do you mean by this?

Energy balance challenges consumers to look at calories consumed, as well as calories
burned, through physical activity and exercise. We’re investing in solutions that address both. We’ve committed to achieving more than half of our new product revenues from Smart Spot products in North America, and our projections show
we’ll significantly surpass that goal. We’re also stepping up efforts in our new product pipeline to capture this opportunity in markets around the world.

On the physical activity front, we believe we can be part of the solution as well. For example, we’re the national presenting sponsor
for America on the Move, a national initiative designed to help Americans achieve energy balance by taking 2,000 more steps a day and reducing calories by 100 each day. It’s been proven to work, and can help almost anyone get started making
simple changes to achieve a healthier lifestyle. We’re also funding other efforts that range from activity-based initiatives with the YMCA, to research-based programming, like the partnership Gatorade has with the University of North
Carolina’s School of Public Health to understand what can help prevent childhood obesity.

With the emphasis on Smart Spot, how will you balance investments in the larger, fun-for-you portfolio?

Our goal is to offer a balanced and broad PepsiCo portfolio with a range of great-tasting product choices. While our better-for-you product portfolio is growing at an
impressive clip, we also know that it’s critical to drive growth in our flagship, heritage brands that comprise our fun-for-you portfolio. For example, within Frito-Lay’s core salty portfolio, we focused on Tostitos with an entirely new
logo and packaging, and an aggressive “on-shelf” strategy to drive visibility and growth for this venerable billion-dollar brand. We’re improving Doritos Nacho Cheesier tortilla chips and making Doritos Black Pepper Jack tortilla
chips a permanent addition to our line. On the beverage side of the business, we have aggressive plans for our trademark Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist brands that demonstrate we remain committed to growing these larger, legacy businesses as
well.


In the past, you’ve talked about the power of Frito-Lay’s direct-store-delivery (DSD) system
differentiating Frito-Lay in the marketplace. Now, you seem to be taking a new approach with a 50% increase in media spending that is being partially funded by the plant consolidations. Is there a change in strategy?

Frito-Lay’s well-known brands feature great taste and really appeal to consumers. The
power of the company’s virtually unrivaled distribution system has enabled us to differentiate these products in the marketplace, and rely to a lesser extent on high-impact marketing and advertising.

With an explosion of convenient foods choices in the categories where Frito-Lay competes, we
need to communicate even more aggressively to strengthen our bond with consumers and highlight our choices for snacking occasions in order to continue growing our top line.

Historically, there has been a focus on your North America business. How does the international market figure into your growth
targets?

The growth and expansion of our international businesses are
vital. PepsiCo International became our largest division – by revenues – in 2004. While the year was extraordinary, for the longer term we believe that we can grow our international business at about twice the rate of growth for the United
States into the foreseeable future.

We’re confident because we have clear
leadership of the global snack category, and significantly lower per capita consumption outside the United States. Our volumes are increasing in every region, and we’re demonstrating we can capture opportunities by customizing our snack
products to meet local tastes and packaging preferences. For example, in Thailand, we’ve introduced Nori Seaweed Lay’s potato chips, and in China, we’ve captured new “office snacking” opportunities through a new pull-out
tray with Lay’s Stax potato crisps.

On the beverage side, we have a
disciplined, focused growth strategy that includes carbonated and non-carbonated brands. We’ve introduced flavor innovations tailored to our markets, new consumer-friendly packaging, and enjoyed great success with high-impact advertising and
music and sports marketing.

Overlaying our flexible portfolio, we have global
productivity programs in ever increasing scale, and a diverse, talented and experienced team from the front line to senior management. All these elements combine to give us great confidence in our international business and its ability to fire on
all cylinders.

Returning to the question about sustainable growth, you
included powerful go-to-market systems as a competitive advantage. What do you mean?

PepsiCo arguably has the most diverse set of distribution systems of any consumer product company, including direct store delivery (DSD) at Frito-Lay and our bottling partners, warehouse delivery for Quaker products,
and warehouse delivery and chilled DSD at Tropicana.


The reach and scale of these systems provide considerable cost efficiency and system effectiveness in driving value.

Our systems deliver product freshness and quality for the consumer, generate
cash flow for our retail customers, and provide economic value for PepsiCo. Our products respond very well to merchandising, and need to be replenished often because they sell so quickly. By having our DSD associates deliver products and stock the
shelves themselves, we save retailers money by doing this labor for them, and help make sure our products are fresh, available and displayed to our advantage.

You’ve referenced PepsiCo’s Power of One as a competitive capability. Can you provide some examples of the advantages that Power of One offers
retailers?

Our Power of One really speaks to our ability to use all
of PepsiCo’s products, services and talents for the advantage of our retail partners. Whether it’s a joint promotion between Pepsi and Frito-Lay for Super Bowl Sunday, a “breakfast bundling” opportunity with Quaker and Tropicana
brands, creating a shared service unit to support our businesses in Mexico or combining our products that contribute to healthier lifestyles under the Smart Spot banner, the idea is to combine the strength of our brands and businesses to develop
customized solutions for customers. This, in turn, drives incremental growth for them, and for us.

We view this as a key strategic growth driver, and will continue to invest in such things as integrated customer teams, research into consumer insights, and creating customized retail solutions to drive growth.

Retail volume growth seems to be slowing in some channels, such as
supermarkets, and accelerating in large-format and discount channels. How is that trend affecting PepsiCo?

It’s obviously important for us to be well-represented in all channels. Like all consumer product companies, we have benefited from the growth of mass merchandisers,
clubs and dollar stores. At the same time, we’re just as committed to working closely with our supermarket partners to help them grow.

The consolidation of retailers has made our Power of One initiative increasingly important. We can approach these retailers as a powerful partner in supporting their
growth objectives. Ultimately, we need to ensure that we have the right products, package sizes, and price points in each channel so that we can maximize growth in each.

Pricing is a key element of our mix. Consumers demand value, which especially means low prices, so we can’t depend on price increases
for revenue growth. That’s why our focus on innovation, commitment to improving product mix, and the priority on delivering customized retail solutions are key to the growth of PepsiCo and our retail customers.


How do you ensure you can deliver on all the priorities required by brand and product investment, and go-to-market
systems?

In a word, it’s about people – our ultimate and
truest source of competitive advantage. We continue to invest in our people as well.

One of the strengths Wall Street has noticed about PepsiCo is our ability to grow talent from within the company – particularly bench strength for our most senior team. I think this reflects a number of our “people
priorities.”

For starters, we’re passionate about developing
leaders. That’s why we provide the training, tools and experiences that give us many options when it comes to preparing leaders for tomorrow. But developing this kind of bench strength demands a comprehensive view of people.

That’s why we have a focus on diversity and inclusion as a strategic lever to drive the
business. As a leading consumer products company, we strive to recruit a diverse workforce to assist us in serving our diverse consumer base. That’s diversity. Equally important, we must ensure we’re creating and sustaining an environment
that allows everyone to contribute at his or her maximum potential in order for the best ideas to come forward – and that’s inclusion.

We hold our leaders accountable – and reward them – on their ability to create and sustain a diverse and inclusive workforce at PepsiCo. We’re seeing
progress. In the last two years, we’ve put 11,000 associates through a first level of diversity and inclusion training and more than 6,000 associates through a second level of inclusion training. Our ongoing internal measurement of how
associates observe diverse and inclusive behavior in management shows we’re moving the dial as well.

I know that our 2004 growth benefited from our diversity and inclusion efforts. Product flavor ideas, promotions and advertising benefited from the views of the entire spectrum of our associates.

Our successes
reinforce that we are on the right track, and we remain committed to this strategic priority as a key growth driver. We know that diversity and inclusion is a journey – in fact, a marathon – and we’ll continue investing in the journey
to reap its utmost benefits.

With your focus on diversity and inclusion,
brand building, and go-to-market capabilities, how will you fund everything?

Some of the investment comes from top-line growth, and some of it comes from productivity initiatives around the world. Whether in supply chain manufacturing, procurement of goods and services, or more efficient trade and media spending, at
any given time PepsiCo has hundreds of productivity programs under way.


We view these efforts to control costs as critical fuel for brand building and innovation work, which leads to top-line
growth that we can use to fund further productivity projects. That’s the value creation cycle I mentioned earlier, and it provides flexibility for us to meet our stated double-digit earnings goals. At the same time, it allows us to return cash
to shareholders through our share buyback program and dividend payments, which PepsiCo’s Board of Directors increased by 44% in 2004.

What is “Business Process Transformation” (BPT) and how does it contribute to the business?

Business Process Transformation (BPT) is the comprehensive effort to drive efficiencies at
PepsiCo, and fuel our future growth. It includes efforts to physically consolidate, or hardwire, key business functions to take advantage of our scale. It also includes moving to a common set of processes that underlie our key activities, and
supporting these activities with common technology applications. And finally, it’s about linking our systems so that data will flow seamlessly from system to system. Our SAP installation – the computer system that will link all of
PepsiCo’s systems and processes – is the linchpin for these efforts. A special project team has started implementing this multi-year BPT effort.

While obviously requiring funding, this is exactly the kind of initiative which is designed to yield efficiencies that we can reinvest back into our business for many
years to come.

Once BPT is fully implemented, we’ll have flexibility in
everything we do. We’ll be able to more easily change any product through better control of our supply chain. We’ll have even greater accuracy in our operations, removing the need for checking and rechecking. We’ll also achieve
efficiencies and consistency by delivering lower costs through common processes and expanded IT capabilities, delivered through one face to the customer. We’ll have end-to-end, real-time visibility to data that allows us to use information as a
true strategic tool. And finally, with a common IT platform, we’ll be able to more quickly expand to take on new businesses seamlessly.

PepsiCo has a lot to accomplish. How do you balance current and future needs without compromising anything?

Here again, it ultimately comes down to people and the values they hold. In last year’s
annual report, our theme was “Growth and Trust.” We emphasized the importance of growth in the right way – as a responsible corporate citizen. Our focus remains centered on behaving in this way.

For example, we continue to make progress with our efforts in environmental management and
sustainability. I encourage shareholders, once again, to read the Corporate Social Responsibility Report in this publication. But it’s also important to understand that we continue to spend a considerable amount of time and energy reinforcing
the PepsiCo Values that will get us growth the right way for our future. We


remain steadfast in our commitment to sustained growth, through empowered people, acting with responsibility and building trust.

When you think about it, we’re lining up what we do best and investing in those
capabilities to drive value today and into our future. And we’re doing it in a responsible way. Our shareholders demand this kind of responsible growth and should expect nothing less, just like all of us at PepsiCo.

Our Customers

Our customers include franchise
bottlers and independent distributors and retailers. We grant our bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements specify the amount to be
paid by our bottlers for concentrate and full goods and for Aquafina royalties, as well as the manufacturing process required for product quality.

Since we do not sell directly to the consumer, we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products.
For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with
each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include coupons, pricing discounts and
promotions, such as sweepstakes and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace
support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of
programs vary annually. The level of bottler funding is at our discretion because these incentives are not required by the terms of our bottling contracts.

Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. represent approximately 11% of our total net revenue. Retail consolidation has increased the importance of major customers and further
consolidation is expected. Our top five retail customers currently represent approximately 27% of our 2004 North American net revenue, with Wal-Mart representing approximately 14%. In addition, sales to The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) represent
approximately 10% of our total net revenue. See “

Our Related Party Bottlers

” and

Note 8

for more information on our anchor bottlers.

Our Related Party Bottlers

We have ownership
interests in certain of our bottlers. Our ownership is less than 50% and since we do not control these bottlers, we do not consolidate their results. We include our share of their net income based on our percentage of economic ownership in our
income statement as bottling equity income. We have designated three related


party bottlers, PBG, PepsiAmericas, Inc. (PAS) and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC (PBV), as our anchor bottlers. Our anchor bottlers distribute approximately
65% of our North American beverage volume and approximately 20% of our international beverage volume. Our anchor bottlers participate in the bottler funding programs described above. Approximately 12% of our total 2004 sales incentives related to
these bottlers. See

Note 8

for additional information on these related parties and related party commitments and guarantees.

Our Distribution Network

Our products are
brought to market through direct-store-delivery, broker-warehouse and food service and vending distribution networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics, and local trade practices.

Direct-Store-Delivery

We and our bottlers operate direct-store-delivery systems that deliver snacks and beverages
directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our bottlers.

Direct-store-delivery enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. Direct-store-delivery is especially well-suited to products
that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.

Broker-Warehouse

Some of our products are delivered
from our warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, have lower turnover, and are less likely to be impulse purchases.

Foodservice and Vending

Our foodservice and vending sales force distributes snacks, foods and beverages to
third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators, and for certain beverages, distributes through our bottlers. This distribution system supplies our products to schools, businesses, stadiums, restaurants and similar locations.

Our Competition

Our businesses operate in highly
competitive markets. We compete against global, regional and private label manufacturers on the basis of price, quality, product variety and effective distribution. Our chief beverage competitor, The Coca-Cola Company, has a slightly larger share of
CSD consumption in the United States, while we have a larger share of chilled juices and isotonics. In addition, The Coca-Cola Company maintains a significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside North America. Further, our snack brands hold
significant leadership positions in the snack industry worldwide and face local and regional competitors, as well as national and global snack competitors, on issues related to price, quality, variety and distribution. Success in this competitive
environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products and the


introduction of new products. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility
of our distribution network, allow us to compete effectively.

Other Relationships

Certain members of our Board
of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. Those Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the
normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of our anchor bottlers and other affiliated companies and do not receive incremental
compensation for their Board services.

Our Business Risks

Our Approach to
Managing Risks

We are subject to risks in the normal course of
business due to adverse developments affecting:

•

our reputation;

•

information technology;

•

product demand and retail consolidation;

•

global economic conditions;

•

regulatory environment;

•

workforce retention; and

•

market risks.

We manage these and other risks through an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes:

•

the PepsiCo Executive Risk Council (PERC), comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group which meets periodically to identify, assess, prioritize
and address primarily strategic and reputational risks;

•

Division Risk Committees (DRC), comprised of cross-functional senior management teams which meet regularly each year to identify, assess, prioritize and address division-specific
operating risks;

•

PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PERC and DRC, identifies and assesses
potential risks, and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as to PepsiCo’s Audit Committee; and

•

PepsiCo Corporate Audit, which confirms the ongoing effectiveness of the risk management framework through periodic audit and review procedures.

Also see “

Market Risks

” below for a discussion on how we manage specific market risks.


Our Reputation

We have a longstanding history of maintaining a good reputation globally which is critical to selling our branded products. If we fail to maintain high standards for
product quality and integrity, our reputation could be jeopardized. In addition, we must protect our reputation by maintaining high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities. Damage to our reputation might
result in rejection of our products by consumers and a loss of brand equity, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.

Information Technology

Information technology is becoming increasingly important as an enabler to operating efficiently and interfacing with customers, as well as maintaining financial accuracy
and efficiency. If we do not allocate, and effectively manage, the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business
disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.

As discussed by our chairman, we have embarked on our multiyear BPT initiative that includes the delivery of an SAP enterprise resource planning application, as well as the migration to common business processes across our North American
operations. The inability to deliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently, and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade, which could result in the loss of customers. In addition, the
failure to either deliver the application on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption.

Product Demand and Retail Consolidation

We
are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. As our chairman notes, our
continued success is dependent on our product innovation, including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products, effective sales incentives, appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs, and the ability to secure adequate shelf space
at our retailers. In addition, our success depends on our responses to consumer trends, such as low carbohydrate diets, consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients, and changes in product category
consumption and consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population. Seasonal weather conditions, particularly for sports drinks and hot cereals, can also impact demand. Our top five retail customers now represent approximately 27%
of our North American net revenue reflecting the continuing consolidation of the retail trade. In this environment, there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. We must maintain
mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including our retailers and anchor bottlers, to effectively compete.


Global Economic and Environmental Conditions

Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes and political unrest may result in business interruption, supply constraints, foreign currency devaluation, inflation, deflation or decreased demand. Economic conditions in North America
could also adversely impact growth. For example, rising fuel costs may impact the sales of our products in convenience stores where our products are generally sold in higher margin single serve packages.

Regulatory Environment

Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in
which we do business and, therefore, impact our results or increase our liabilities. Such regulatory environment changes include changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and deceptive marketing practices, accounting standards,
taxation requirements, competition laws and environmental laws, including the regulation of water consumption and treatment.

Workforce Retention

Our continued growth requires us to develop our leadership bench and to implement programs, such as our long-term incentive program, designed to retain talent. We also
compete to hire new employees, and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. We have in place human resource programs, including our diversity and inclusion focus mentioned by our chairman, aimed at hiring, developing and
retaining our talented and motivated workforce which provides us with competitive advantage. However, unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.

Market Risks

We are exposed to the market
risks arising from adverse changes in:

•

commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;

•

foreign exchange rates;

•

interest rates;

•

stock prices; and

•

discount rates, affecting the measurement of our pension and retiree medical liabilities.

In the normal course of business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global
purchasing programs and hedging strategies. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification of meaningful cost saving opportunities or efficiencies and effective implementation. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase
orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies involve the use of derivatives designated as cash flow and fair value hedges. The fair value of our hedges fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity


of our hedges to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See

Note 10

for further discussion of these hedges and our hedging policies. See “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension plan assets and pension and retiree medical liabilities to risks related to stock prices and discount rates.

Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also
impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “

Product Demand and Retail Consolidation

” and “

Global Economic Conditions

” above for further discussion.

Commodity Prices

Our open commodity
derivative contracts designated as hedges had a face value of $155 million at December 25, 2004 and $43 million at December 27, 2003. These derivatives resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1 million at December 25, 2004 and $4 million at December
27, 2003. We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have resulted in an unrealized loss of $16 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003.

Foreign Exchange

Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments
resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders’ equity, called currency translation adjustment.

Our operations outside of the U.S. generate over a third of our net revenue of which Mexico,
the United Kingdom and Canada comprise nearly 20%. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency risks, including unforeseen economic changes and political unrest. During 2004, the impact of the favorable euro and British pound was partially
offset by the unfavorable Mexican peso resulting in a contribution of almost 2 percentage points to revenue growth. If declines in the Mexican peso continue and are not offset, our future results will be adversely impacted.

Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as
transaction gains or losses in the income statement as incurred. We may enter into derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $908 million at December 25, 2004
and $484 million at December 27, 2003. These contracts had net unrealized losses of $27 million at December 25, 2004 and $30 million at December 27, 2003, respectively. We estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have
resulted in an unrealized loss of $123 million in 2004 and $50 million in 2003, respectively.


Interest Rates

We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We may use
interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. These swaps are entered into
concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.

Our counterparty
credit risk is considered low because these swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties, are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.

Assuming year-end 2004 and 2003 variable rate debt and investment levels, a one point increase in interest rates would have decreased net
interest expense by $11 million in 2004 and $10 million in 2003.

Stock
Prices

A portion of our deferred compensation liability is tied to
certain market indices and our stock price. We manage these market risks with mutual fund investments and prepaid forward contracts for the purchase of our stock. The combined gains or losses on these investments are offset by changes in our
deferred compensation liability, which are included in corporate selling, general and administrative expenses.

We discuss expectations regarding our future performance, such as our business outlook, in our annual and quarterly reports, press releases, and other written and oral statements. These “forward-looking
statements” are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our
expectations. The preceding discussion of risks is by no means all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our trends and future results.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

An appreciation
of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact
our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for stock-based compensation and certain allocation
methodologies for pension and retiree medical, our critical accounting policies do not involve the choice between alternative methods of accounting. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods
presented and have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.


Our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:

•

revenue recognition,

•

brand and goodwill valuations,

•

income tax expense and accruals,

•

stock-based compensation expense, and

•

pension and retiree medical plans.

Revenue Recognition

Our products are sold for
cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery and may allow discounts for early payment. We recognize revenue upon shipment or
delivery to our customers in accordance with written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that
consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for warehouse distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. Based on our historical experience with this practice, we have reserved for
anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. Our bottlers have a similar replacement policy and are responsible for the products they distribute.

Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or
delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through our other distribution networks, customer inventory levels are monitored.

As discussed in “

Our Customers

,” we offer sales incentives through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and totaled $6.6 billion in 2004, $6.0 billion in 2003 and $5.5
billion in 2002. Sales incentives include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space, and discounts to
promote lower retail prices. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on our
historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and therefore do not require
highly uncertain long-term estimates. For interim reporting, we estimate total annual sales incentives and record a pro rata share in proportion to revenue. Certain arrangements, including fountain pouring rights, may extend up to 15 years. The
costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the life of the contract as a reduction of revenue, and the outstanding balances of $337 million at year-end 2004 and $359 million at year-end 2003 are included in other assets in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.


We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts. Our method of
determining the reserves has been consistent during the years presented in the consolidated financial statements. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

Brand and Goodwill Valuations

We sell products
under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. The brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and goodwill in acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable
assets and liabilities, including brands, based on estimated fair value, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill.

We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has significant market share in a stable macroeconomic environment, and a history of strong revenue and cash flow
performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 20 years. Determining the expected life of a
brand requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.

Goodwill, including the goodwill that is part of our noncontrolled bottling
investment balances, and perpetual brands are not amortized. Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure that discounted future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual brand is
impaired if its book value exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division. If the fair value of an
evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows.

Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash
flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our
impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in the “

Our Business Risks

” section, including, but not limited to, operating risks, product demand and the competitive landscape.

We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill during the years presented. As of December 25, 2004, we had $4.8 billion of perpetual brands
and


goodwill, of which nearly 75% related to Tropicana and Walkers. In our most recent impairment evaluations for Tropicana and Walkers, no impairment charges
would have resulted even if the fair market values resulting from our discounted cash flow analyses were assumed to be 5% lower.

Income Tax Expense and Accruals

In 2004, our
annual tax rate for continuing operations was 24.7% compared to 28.5% in 2003 as discussed in “

Other Consolidated Results

.” The tax rate in 2004 decreased 3.8 percentage points primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of certain open tax issues. For 2005, our annual tax rate is expected to be 29.4%,
reflecting the absence of the favorable 2004 resolutions, and excluding any impact of the potential repatriation of certain undistributed international earnings discussed below and in

Note 5

.

Our annual tax rate is based on our income,
statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when,
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax
attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax benefits from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items.

Tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a
result, our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some
differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in
future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or
credit in that tax jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but we
have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.


We have not recognized any U.S. tax expense on undistributed international earnings since we intend to reinvest the
earnings outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future, subject to the opportunity afforded us as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). Our undistributed earnings are approximately $11.9 billion at December 25, 2004, and $8.8
billion at December 27, 2003. We are currently contemplating taking advantage of the AJCA for up to $7.5 billion of our undistributed foreign earnings. See

Note 5

for further discussion on the AJCA and its potential impact on our 2005 results.

A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax
audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. During 2004, we recognized $266 million of tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain open tax issues. In addition, in 2004, we recognized a benefit of $38 million upon agreement with
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on an open issue related to our discontinued restaurant operations. At the end of 2003, we entered into agreements with the IRS for open years through 1997. These agreements resulted in a tax benefit of $109
million in the fourth quarter of 2003. As part of these agreements, we also resolved the treatment of certain other issues related to future tax years.

The IRS has initiated their audits of our tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002. Our tax returns subsequent to 2002 have not yet been examined. While it is often
difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use
of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. Our tax reserves, covering all federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, are presented in the balance sheet within other liabilities
(see

Note 14

), except for any amounts relating to items we expect to pay in the coming year which are included in current income taxes payable. For more information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues, see “

Other Consolidated Results

” and “

Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

We believe that
we will achieve our best results if our employees act and are rewarded as business owners. Therefore, we believe stock ownership and stock-based incentive awards are the best way to align the interests of employees with those of our shareholders.
Historically, following competitive market practices, we have used stock option grants as our primary form of long-term incentive compensation. These grants are made at the current stock price, meaning each employee’s exercise price is
equivalent to our stock price on the date of grant. Employees must generally provide three additional years of service to earn the grant, referred to as the vesting period. Our options generally have a 10-year term, which means our employees would
have up to seven years after the vesting period to elect to pay the exercise price to purchase one share of our stock for each option exercised. Employees benefit from stock options to the extent our stock price appreciates above the exercise price
after vesting and during the term of the grant.


There have been no reductions to the exercise price of previously issued awards, and any repricing of awards would require approval of our shareholders.

Our new executive compensation program, effective for 2004, strengthens the
relationship between pay and individual performance through greater differentiation in the amount of base pay, bonus and stock-based compensation based on an employee’s responsibility and performance. The new program results in a shift of both
cash and stock-based compensation to our top performing executives. In addition, our new program provides executives, who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance, with a choice of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs).
RSUs generally vest after three years of service and each restricted stock unit can be settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period. Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been
granted. Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% RSUs. Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets.

We also continued, as we have since 1989, to grant an annual award of stock options to all
eligible employees, based on job level or classification under our broad-based stock option program, SharePower. As part of the new compensation program in 2004, the SharePower program grant was reduced by approximately 50% for employees in the U.S.
and replaced with matching contributions of PepsiCo stock to our 401(k) savings plans. We did not reduce the SharePower award for international employees and continued using tenure as a base for delivering the award in addition to job level and
classification. For additional information on our 401(k) savings plans, see

Note 7

.

Method of Accounting

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method
of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock-based compensation expense at the date of grant. We do not expect Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123R,

Share-Based Payment,

to materially impact our
financial statements upon adoption no later than in the fourth quarter of 2005. Two of our anchor bottlers, PBG and PAS, will be adopting SFAS 123R in 2005. They are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 123R which will consequently impact our
bottling equity income.

Beginning in 2004, our divisions were held accountable
for stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. Prior year division results have been adjusted for comparability. The allocation of compensation expense is
approximately 28% FLNA, 19% PBNA, 32% PI, 4% QFNA and 17% corporate unallocated. The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our Black-Scholes assumptions which reflect market conditions over which division management
has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.


Our Assumptions

Our Black-Scholes model estimates the expected value our employees will receive from the options based on a number of assumptions, such as interest rates, employee
exercises, our stock price and dividend yield. Our weighted-average fair value assumptions include:

The expected life is a significant
assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest rate, volatility and dividend yield must be applied. The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our
historical experience with similar grants. The risk free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the
expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price.

2005 Estimated Expense and Sensitivity of Assumptions

Our stock-based compensation expense, including RSUs, is as follows:

Estimated




Stock-based compensation expense

If we assumed a 100 basis point change

If the expected life were assumed to
be one year longer, our estimated 2005 stock-based compensation expense would increase by $9 million. If the expected life were assumed to be one year shorter, our estimated 2005 stock-based compensation expense would decrease by $6 million. As
noted, changing the assumed expected life impacts all of the Black-Scholes valuation assumptions as the risk free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are estimated over the expected life.


Pension and Retiree Medical Plans

Our pension
plans cover full-time employees in the U.S. and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. U.S. retirees are also eligible for medical and life
insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder up
to the total cost.

Our Assumptions

The pension or retiree medical benefits expected to be paid are expensed over the
employees’ expected service. We must make many assumptions to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense, including:

•

the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate);

•

the expected return on assets in our funded plans;

•

the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;

•

certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and

•

for retiree medical benefits, health care cost trend rates.

The assumptions, assets and liabilities used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense are determined as of September 30 (measurement date) and all plan
assets and liabilities are reported as of that date. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. Some of these assumptions require significant management judgment and could
have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical benefit expense and obligation. However, any impact from the changes in retiree medical assumptions would be mitigated by the cap on these benefits.

Since pension and retiree medical liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the
discount rate is a significant assumption. At each measurement date, the discount rate is based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities. The expected return on pension
plan assets is based on our historical experience, our pension plan investment strategy, and our expectations for long-term rates of return. Our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is based upon plan liabilities, an evaluation
of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. We use a third-party consultant to assist us in determining our investment allocation and modeling our long-term rate assumptions. Our current investment allocation
target for our U.S. plans is 60% equity securities, with the balance in fixed income securities. Our current assumed rate of return on plan assets is 7.8%, reflecting an estimated long-term return of 9.3% from equity securities and an estimated 5.8%
from fixed income securities. As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, plan assets used in determining the expected return component of annual pension expense reflect the difference between the actual and the expected return in
any one year over five years. Therefore, it takes five years for the gain or loss from any one year to be fully included in the measurement of plan assets.


Other gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions are also determined at each
measurement date. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing
or decreasing benefits for prior employee service, is included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.

Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are the following:

Future Expense

Our 2005 pension expense is estimated to be approximately $310
million and retiree medical expense is estimated to be approximately $135 million. These estimates incorporate the 2005 assumptions, as well as the impact of the increased pension plan assets resulting from our discretionary contributions of $400
million in 2004, and the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) as discussed in

Note 7

. Changes in our 2005 assumptions include updates to our mortality tables, employee turnover assumptions, and retirement age assumptions. These changes result in an increase in our pension experience loss amortization
for 2005 of $45 million. In addition, the increase in amortization for 2005 pension expense reflects the absence of asset gain amortization of approximately $50 million in 2004 in accordance with our methodology discussed above. An analysis of the
estimated change in pension and retiree medical expense follows:

Pension service costs, including the
impact of demographic assumption changes on service costs, are reflected in division results, with the impact of changes in discount and


asset return rates, gains and losses, and the impact of funding reflected in corporate unallocated. Under this policy, approximately $20 million of the
increased pension and retiree medical expense in 2005 will be reflected in corporate unallocated expense.

Based on our current assumptions, which reflect our prior experience and current plan provisions, and assuming we are allowed to make annual discretionary contributions of approximately $400 million, we expect our
pension expense to increase by approximately $15 million in 2006. In 2007, our pension expense would begin to decrease, with the expense dropping to approximately $220 million by 2010 as unrecognized asset losses are fully amortized. If our
assumptions and our plan provisions for retiree medical remain unchanged and our experience mirrors these assumptions, we expect our annual retiree medical expense beyond 2005 to approximate $140 million.

Sensitivity of Assumptions

A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on assets would
increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the discount rate on 2005 pension expense is a change of approximately $32 million. The estimated impact on 2005 pension expense of a 25 basis point change in the expected
rate of return on assets is a change of approximately $13 million. See

Note 7

regarding the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.

Future Funding

We make
contributions to pension trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions, and taxation to
the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently deductible or when the employee would be taxed prior to receipt of benefit.

Our pension contributions for 2004 were $458 million of which $400 million was discretionary.
In 2005, we expect contributions to be about the same with approximately $400 million expected to be discretionary and the remainder satisfying minimum requirements. Our cash payments for retiree medical are estimated to be $85 million in 2005. As
our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis. For estimated future benefit payments, including our pay-as-you-go payments as well as those from trusts, see

Note 7

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

Items Affecting Comparability

The year-over-year
comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items:

For the items and accounting changes
affecting our 2002 results, see

Note 1

and our 2002 Annual Report.

Impairment
and Restructuring Charges and Merger-Related Costs

In the fourth
quarter of 2004, we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $150 million in conjunction with the consolidation of FLNA’s manufacturing network in connection with its ongoing productivity program. Savings from this productivity program
have been and are expected to be used to offset increased marketplace spending.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we incurred a restructuring charge of $147 million in conjunction with the streamlining of our North American divisions and PepsiCo International. Also, during 2003 and in 2002, we incurred costs associated
with our merger with The Quaker Oats Company (Quaker).

For additional
information, see

Note 3

.

Net Tax Benefits – Continuing
Operations

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized $45 million
of tax benefits related to the completion of the IRS audit for pre-merger Quaker open tax years. In the third quarter of 2004, we recognized $221 million of tax benefits related to a reduction in foreign tax accruals following the resolution of
certain open tax issues with foreign tax authorities, and a refund claim related to prior U.S. tax settlements.


At the end of 2003, we entered into agreements with the IRS for open tax years through 1997. These agreements resulted in
a tax benefit of $109 million. As part of these agreements, we also resolved the treatment of certain other issues related to future tax years.

For additional information, see “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

.”

Tax
Benefit from Discontinued Operations

In the fourth quarter of 2004,
we reached agreement with the IRS for an open issue related to our discontinued restaurant operations which resulted in a tax benefit of $38 million.

Results of Continuing Operations – Consolidated Review

In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below,

effective net pricing

reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling
varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Servings

Since our divisions each use different
measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.
Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.

Total servings increased 6% in 2004 compared to 2003 as servings for beverages worldwide grew 7% and servings for snacks worldwide grew over 5%. All of our divisions positively contributed to the total servings growth. Total servings
increased 5% in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to contributions from PI, PBNA and FLNA.


Net Revenue and Operating Profit


Division net revenue increased 8%, primarily due to strong volume gains
across all divisions, favorable product mix, primarily at PBNA and PI, and net favorable foreign currency movements. The volume gains contributed over 4 percentage points, the favorable mix contributed almost 2 percentage points, and the net
favorable foreign currency contributed almost 2 percentage points to division net revenue growth.

Total operating profit increased 10% and margin increased 0.3 percentage points. Division operating profit increased 12% and division margin increased 0.5 percentage points. These gains reflect leverage from the
revenue growth, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily corporate unallocated expenses. In addition, total operating profit growth reflects the absence of merger-related costs in 2004.


Net revenue increased 7%. Division net revenue increased 8%, primarily due to the strong
volume which contributed 4 percentage points of growth. Favorable product and country mix, as well as North American snack and concentrate price increases, contributed over 2 percentage points to the growth. Favorable foreign currency movements
contributed nearly 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth.


Total operating profit increased 11% and margin increased 0.6 percentage points. Division operating profit increased 11%
and division margin increased 0.5 percentage points. These gains were driven by the strong volume and higher effective net pricing. Cost of sales increased 8%, reflecting increased commodity costs, particularly corn oil and natural gas. Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased 6% driven by higher selling costs primarily reflecting the increased volume and increased fuel costs. Unfavorable foreign currency reduced operating profit growth by nearly 1 percentage point. In
addition, total operating profit reflects the benefit from lower merger-related costs, offset by the 2003 impairment and restructuring charges of $147 million.

Corporate Unallocated Expenses

Corporate unallocated expenses include the costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as our BPT initiative, unallocated insurance and
benefit programs, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, profit-in-inventory elimination adjustments for our noncontrolled bottling affiliates, and certain other items.

In 2004, corporate unallocated expenses increased 38%. Higher employee-related costs contributed 18 percentage points of the increase, an
accrual recognized in the fourth quarter for the settlement of a contractual dispute with a former business partner represented 10 percentage points of the increase, and higher costs related to our BPT initiative contributed 4 percentage points of
the increase. Corporate departmental expenses increased 2% compared to prior year.

In 2003, corporate unallocated expenses increased 14% primarily reflecting our 2003 investment in our BPT initiative. Higher employee-related costs, including deferred compensation, and corporate departmental costs also contributed to the
increase. The increase in the deferred compensation costs is partially offset by the decrease in net interest expense. Corporate departmental expenses increased 3% reflecting staffing and other costs related to our health and wellness initiatives.


Other Consolidated Results

Bottling equity income includes our
share of the net income or loss of our noncontrolled bottling affiliates as described in “

Our Customers

.” Our interest in these bottling investments may change from time to time. Any gains or losses from these changes, as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments, are also included on a
pre-tax basis. Over time, we expect to be selling shares of PBG stock to trim our ownership to the level at the time of PBG’s initial public offering. Our ownership has increased as a result of PBG’s share repurchase program. During 2005,
we intend to sell up to 7.5 million shares of PBG stock. The resulting lower ownership percentage will reduce the equity income from PBG that we recognize.


Bottling equity income increased 18%, primarily reflecting increased earnings from our anchor bottlers and favorable comparisons from international bottling investments, primarily as a result of the nationwide strike in Venezuela in early
2003.

Net interest expense declined 17% primarily due to favorable interest
rates and higher average cash balances, partially offset by higher average debt balances and lower gains in the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. The offsetting increase in
deferred compensation costs is reported in corporate unallocated expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses.

The annual tax rate decreased 3.8 percentage points compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of tax benefits from the resolution of open items with tax
authorities in both years, as discussed in “Items Affecting Comparability.” The tax benefits reduced our tax rate by 2.6 percentage points. Increased benefit from concentrate operations and favorable changes arising from agreements with
the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter of 2003 also contributed to the decline in rate.


Net income from continuing operations increased 17% and the related net income per common share from continuing
operations increased 18%. These increases primarily reflect the solid operating profit growth and our lower annual tax rate. The absence of merger-related costs in 2004 and increased bottling equity income also contributed to the growth.


Bottling equity income increased 16%. This increase primarily reflects a favorable comparison to the impairment charge taken in 2002 on a
Latin American bottling investment, and increased earnings from PBG and PAS in 2003.

Net interest expense declined 21% primarily due to a gain of $22 million on investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability versus losses of $18 million in the prior year. This net gain was partially
offset by lower investment rates.

The annual tax rate decreased 3.8 percentage
points compared to the prior year. At the end of 2003, we entered into agreements with the IRS. These agreements resulted in a tax benefit of $109 million, reducing our tax rate by over 2 percentage points. Lower taxes on foreign results, including
the impact of our new concentrate operations, also reduced our tax rate by nearly 2 percentage points. The impact of lower nondeductible merger-related costs contributed 0.9 percentage points to the decrease.

Net income increased 19% and the related net income per common share increased 22%. These
increases primarily reflect the solid operating profit growth, our lower annual tax rate and increased bottling equity income. The benefit of lower merger-related costs was largely offset by the impairment and restructuring charges. Net income per
common share also reflects the benefit of a reduction in average shares outstanding primarily as a result of share repurchase activity.


Results of Continuing Operations – Division Review

The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions. Prior year amounts exclude the results of divested businesses. For additional information on these items and our
divisions, see

Note 1

.

Frito-Lay North America


Net revenue grew 5% reflecting volume growth of 3% and positive effective net
pricing due to salty snack pricing actions and favorable mix. Pound volume grew primarily due to new products, single-digit growth in Lay’s Classic potato chips, strong double-digit growth in Variety Pack, and mid single-digit growth in
Tostitos and Fried Cheetos. Lay’s Stax and Doritos Rollitos led the new product growth. These gains were partially offset by single-digit declines in Doritos and Fritos, and double-digit declines in Rold Gold and Quaker Toastables.


Operating profit grew nearly 7% reflecting the positive pricing actions and volume growth. Higher commodity costs, driven
by corn oil and energy costs were largely offset by cost leverage generated from ongoing productivity initiatives.

On September 1, 2004, we introduced our new “Smart Spot” program which helps consumers identify products in our portfolio that can contribute to a healthier
lifestyle. Products qualifying for our new Smart Spot program represented approximately 10% of 2004 FLNA net revenue. These products experienced high single-digit revenue growth and the balance of the portfolio had mid single-digit revenue growth.
See our website at www.smartspot.com for additional information on our new Smart Spot program.


Net revenue growth of 6% reflects volume growth of 4% and positive effective net pricing. Pound volume grew primarily due to new products, double-digit growth in Cheetos,
Munchies snack mix and Quaker Chewy Granola bars, and single-digit growth in branded dips and Doritos. Quaker Toastables, Lay’s Stax and the Natural snack line led the new product growth. These gains were partially offset by double-digit
declines in Rold Gold, Lay’s Bistro, and Go Snacks. Modest pricing actions on certain salty snacks and favorable mix led the positive effective net pricing. These gains were partially offset by higher trade spending on product innovation.

Operating profit growth of 8% reflects the volume growth and positive
effective net pricing. These gains were partially offset by increased commodity costs, particularly corn oil and natural gas. Increased commodity costs reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points, more than offsetting the cost leverage
generated from productivity initiatives.

Pe

psiCo Beverages North America


Net revenue increased 7% and volume increased 3%. The volume increase
reflects non-carbonated beverage growth of 10% and a slight increase in carbonated soft drinks (CSDs). The non-carbonated beverage growth was fueled by double-digit growth in Gatorade, Aquafina and Propel, as well as the introduction of
bottler-distributed Tropicana juice drinks. Tropicana Pure Premium increased slightly for the year. The carbonated soft drink performance reflects a low single-digit increase in Trademark Mountain Dew and a slight increase in Trademark Sierra Mist,
offset by a slight decline in Trademark Pepsi. Across the trademarks, high single-digit diet CSD growth was


substantially offset by a low single-digit decline in regular CSDs. The increase in Trademark Mountain Dew reflects growth in both Diet and regular Mountain
Dew and the limited time only offering of Mountain Dew Pitch Black, substantially offset by declines in both Mountain Dew Code Red and LiveWire. The performance of Trademark Pepsi reflects declines in regular Pepsi, Pepsi Twist and Pepsi Blue,
mostly offset by increases in Diet Pepsi and the introduction of Pepsi Edge. Favorable product mix contributed 3 percentage points to net revenue growth, primarily reflecting a migration to non-carbonated beverages. Additionally, concentrate and
fountain price increases taken in the first quarter contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.

Operating profit increased 13% reflecting the net revenue growth, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs, as well as costs related to marketplace initiatives.

Products qualifying for our new Smart Spot program represented over 60% of net revenue. These
products experienced high single-digit revenue growth, and the balance of the portfolio had mid single-digit revenue growth.


Net revenue increased 7% on volume growth of 3%. The volume growth reflects non-carbonated growth of 8% and carbonated beverage growth of 1.5%. Double-digit growth in Gatorade, Aquafina and Propel drove the non-carbonated portfolio.
Tropicana chilled products growth was low single-digit. The carbonated beverage performance reflects the national launch of Sierra Mist and high single-digit growth in diet carbonated beverages, primarily Diet Pepsi. Declines in trademark Pepsi,
excluding diet, partially offset this carbonated beverage growth. Higher effective net pricing contributed 4 percentage points to the net revenue growth. The higher effective net pricing reflects a favorable product mix shift to the higher priced
non-carbonated beverages, and fountain and concentrate price increases, partially offset by increased promotional spending. The price increases contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth.

Operating profit increased 14 percentage points reflecting the higher effective net pricing,
volume gains and purchasing efficiencies. These gains were partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses. The higher effective net pricing contributed 9 percentage points to the operating profit growth with product mix
contributing 7 percentage points.


PepsiCo International


International snacks volume grew 8%, comprised of 7% in our Latin America
region, 8% in our Europe, Middle East & Africa region and 14% in our Asia Pacific region. These gains were driven by high single-digit growth at Sabritas in Mexico, strong double-digit growth in India, low single-digit growth at Gamesa in Mexico
coupled with double-digit growth in Egypt, Venezuela, Turkey and Brazil.

Beverage volume grew 12%, comprised of 14% in our Europe, Middle East & Africa region, 15% in our Asia Pacific region and 8% in our Latin America region. Broad-based increases were led by double-digit growth in the Middle East and
China, high single-digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in India, Germany, Russia and Venezuela. Favorable comparisons as a result of the 2003 national strike in Venezuela and the German deposit law impact contributed to the growth in
Venezuela and Germany. Both carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages grew at double-digit rates.

Net revenue grew 14% driven by the broad-based volume growth and favorable mix. Foreign currency impact contributed 4 percentage points of growth driven by the favorable British pound and euro, partially offset by the
unfavorable Mexican peso. Acquisitions contributed less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit grew 25% driven largely by the volume and favorable mix. The favorable comparison of certain reserve actions taken in 2003 on potentially unrecoverable beverage assets contributed 2 percentage points of growth. Foreign
currency impact contributed almost 3 percentage points of growth driven by the favorable British pound and euro, partially offset by the unfavorable Mexican peso.


International snacks volume grew 6%, comprised of 3% in our Latin America region, 10% in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region and 16% in our Asia Pacific region.
These gains were driven by double-digit growth from Walkers in the United Kingdom, India, Turkey and Russia, and low single-digit growth at Sabritas in Mexico. Mid single-digit sweet growth was led by Gamesa in Mexico.

Beverage volume grew 8%, comprised of 8% in our Latin America region, 6% in our Europe,
Middle East and Africa region and 11% in our Asia Pacific region. Broad-based increases were led by double-digit growth in the Middle East, China, Brazil, India, Russia


and Thailand and mid single-digit growth in Mexico. Volume gains in India driven by competitive pricing actions were offset by double-digit declines in
Germany due to the new one-way bottle deposit requirement imposed by the government.

Net revenue grew 12% driven by higher volume across most markets. Acquisitions contributed nearly 2 percentage points of growth and favorable foreign currency contributed 1 percentage point as the favorable euro and British pound
substantially offset the unfavorable Mexican peso. These gains were partially offset by the impact of the German one-way beverage deposits and competitive beverage pricing actions in India.

Operating profit grew 17% largely due to the drivers of net revenue growth. Acquisitions
contributed 2 percentage points of growth. Unfavorable foreign currency reduced operating profit by 6 percentage points due to the impact of the peso on our Mexican snack businesses. In addition, operating profits were reduced by 2 percentage points
due to reserve actions taken on potentially unrecoverable beverage assets.

Quaker Foods North America


Net revenue increased 4% and volume increased 3%. The volume increase
reflects high single-digit growth in Oatmeal and double-digit growth in Life cereal, partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in Cap’n Crunch cereal. The Life cereal growth was led by the introduction of Honey Graham Life. Favorable
product mix, reflecting growth in higher revenue per pound brands, was offset by promotional spending behind new products. Favorable Canadian exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.

Operating profit increased 1% reflecting the net revenue growth, substantially offset by an
unfavorable cost of sales comparison and higher advertising and marketing costs. Products qualifying for our new Smart Spot program represented approximately half of net revenue and had high single-digit revenue growth. The balance of the portfolio
was flat.


Net revenue and volume were flat compared to prior year as the national launch of Breakfast
Squares and Canadian Oatmeal to Go growth were offset by declines in Rice and Pasta Roni side dishes and in our hot cereal business. A favorable Canadian exchange rate, which contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth, and ready-to-eat


cereal price increases, were offset by unfavorable product mix and increased promotional spending related to the Breakfast Squares launch.

Operating profit grew 3% compared to prior year. Lower advertising and marketing spending
contributed over 4 percentage points to operating profit growth, while favorable cost of sales contributed almost 5 percentage points. These gains were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix, which reduced operating profit growth by 7
percentage points. The unfavorable product mix reflects declines in higher margin products.

Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position

Our strong cash-generating capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world. Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow. This cash-generating capability is one of our
fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating, investing and financing needs. In addition, we have revolving credit facilities that are further discussed in

Note 9

. Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and
holiday-related sales patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter.

    h) Divestitures     i) Acquisitions     k) Long-term debt     m) Other, net

Operating Activities

In 2004, our operations provided $5.1 billion of cash, primarily reflecting our solid business results, partially offset by net tax payments of $1.8 billion and pension
plan contributions of $458 million of which $400 million was discretionary. In 2003, our operations provided $4.3 billion of cash reflecting our solid business results, partially offset by net tax payments of $1.5 billion and pension plan
contributions of $535 million of which $500 million was discretionary. The year-over-year increase in cash flows from operations is primarily attributable to our solid business results and effective working capital management, partially offset by
the higher tax payments in 2004.


Investing Activities

In 2004, we used $2.3 billion for investing, primarily reflecting capital spending of $1.4 billion and short-term investments of almost $1.0
billion. In 2003, we used $2.3 billion for investing, primarily reflecting capital spending of $1.3 billion and short-term investments of nearly $1.0 billion.

We expect capital spending to continue at a rate of approximately 5% of net revenue in 2005. In December 2004, we announced that we would acquire General Mills,
Inc.’s 40.5% ownership interest in Snack Ventures Europe (SVE) for $750 million. We expect the transaction to be completed in early 2005. This transaction will be funded with existing international cash. In addition, in 2005, we will generate
cash from the expected sale of up to 7.5 million shares of PBG stock.

Financing Activities

In 2004, we used $2.3 billion for
financing, primarily reflecting share repurchases at a cost of $3.0 billion and dividend payments of $1.3 billion, partially offset by net issuances of short-term borrowings of $1.1 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of nearly $1.0
billion. This compares to $2.9 billion used for financing in 2003, primarily reflecting share repurchases at a cost of $1.9 billion and dividend payments of $1.1 billion.

In the second quarter of 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a new $7.0 billion share repurchase program. Since inception of the new
program, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of shares, leaving $4.9 billion of remaining authorization. We target an annual dividend payout of approximately 45% of prior year’s net income from continuing operations. Each spring we review our
capital structure with our Board, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.

Management Operating Cash Flow

We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value, and it is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance. However, it is not a measure provided by accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors
should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. The table below reconciles the net cash provided by operating activities as reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to our management
operating cash flow.


Management operating cash flow was used primarily to repurchase shares and pay dividends. We expect management operating
cash flow in 2005 to exceed $4.1 billion reflecting our underlying business growth. We expect to continue to return approximately all of our management operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and expect our
share repurchases to range from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion in 2005. However, see “

Our Business Risks

” for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows.

Credit Ratings

Our debt ratings of Aa3 from Moody’s and A+ from Standard & Poor’s contribute to our ability to access global capital markets. We have maintained strong investment grade ratings for over a decade.
Moody’s rating reflects an upgrade from A1 to Aa3 in 2004 due to the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows. Each rating is considered strong investment grade and is in the first quartile of their respective ranking systems. These ratings
also reflect the impact of our anchor bottlers’ cash flows and debt.

As
discussed in

Note 5

, we are evaluating our options with respect to repatriating undistributed international earnings under the AJCA. If we decide to repatriate funds in excess of available international cash, we would be required to
borrow funds. We would not expect this activity to adversely impact our credit ratings.

Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments

See

Note 9

for a description of our credit facilities and long-term contractual commitments.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements, other than in the normal course of business, nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our
bottlers, noncontrolled affiliates or third parties. However, certain guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us. As of year-end 2004, we believe it is remote that these guarantees would
require any cash payment. See

Note 9

for a description of our off-balance sheet arrangements.


Financial Position

Significant changes in our consolidated balance sheet from December 27, 2003 to December 25, 2004 not discussed above were as follows:

•

Investments in noncontrolled affiliates increased $364 million primarily due to higher equity income, partially offset by dividends received.

•

Income taxes payable decreased $512 million primarily reflecting net tax payments of $1.8 billion, partially offset by our current provision. The payments include $760 million paid
in the second quarter as a result of our 2003 settlement with the IRS.

Future Outlook

Our long-term financial targets
are mid single-digit volume and net revenue growth, and low double-digit EPS growth. The results of any one year may differ from our long-term targets. Our 2005 results will include the results of a 53

rd

week.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions

Basis of Presentation

Our financial
statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates based on our economic ownership interest. We do not control these other
affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than 50%. Our share of the net income of noncontrolled bottling affiliates is reported in our income statement as bottling equity income. See

Note 8

for additional information on our noncontrolled bottling affiliates. Our share of other noncontrolled affiliates is included in division operating profit. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

Impairment and restructuring charges and merger-related costs
(described in

Note 3

) and net tax benefits from continuing and discontinued operations (described in

Note 5

) affect the comparability of our consolidated results. See “

Our Divisions

” below and for additional unaudited information on these items, see “

Items Affecting Comparability

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made
to prior year amounts to conform to the 2004 presentation.

Our Divisions

We manufacture or use contract
manufacturers, market and sell a variety of salty, sweet and grain-based snacks, carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, and foods through our North American and international business divisions. Our North American divisions include the United
States and Canada. The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in

Note 2

, except for certain allocation methodologies for stock-based compensation expense and pension and retiree medical expense as described in the unaudited information in “Our Critical Accounting Policies.”

Division results are based on how our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
manages our divisions. Division results exclude significant restructuring and impairment charges, merger-related costs and divested businesses. For additional unaudited information on our divisions, see “

Our Operations

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.


Divested Businesses

During 2003, we sold our Quaker Foods North America Mission pasta
business. During 2002, we sold our Quaker Foods North America bagged cereal business and our PepsiCo International food businesses in Colombia and Venezuela. The results of these businesses are reported as divested businesses.

Corporate

Corporate includes costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives, such
as our BPT initiative, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, foreign exchange


transaction gains and losses, profit-in-inventory elimination adjustments for our noncontrolled bottling affiliates and certain other items.

Impairment and Restructuring Charges and Merger-Related Costs

Note 3.

Other Division
Information


(a)

Corporate assets consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, primarily held outside the U.S., and property, plant and equipment.

(b)

(c)

Long-lived assets represent net property, plant and equipment, nonamortizable and net amortizable intangible assets and investments in noncontrolled affiliates. These assets are
reported in the country where they are primarily used.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue
upon shipment or delivery to our customers in accordance with written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for direct-store-delivery (DSD) and chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date
products from store shelves to ensure that our consumers receive the product quality and freshness that they expect. Similarly, our policy for warehouse distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. Based on our historical
experience with this practice, we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including our policy on bad debts, see “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We are exposed to concentration of credit risk by our customers, Wal-Mart and PBG. Wal-Mart represents approximately 11% of our net
revenue and PBG represents approximately 10%. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.


Sales Incentives and Other Marketplace Spending

We offer sales incentives through various programs to our customers and consumers. Sales
incentives are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $6.6 billion in 2004, $6.0 billion in 2003 and $5.5 billion in 2002. Most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year. However, we have arrangements, such as
fountain pouring rights, which may extend up to 15 years. Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are expensed over the contract period and the remaining balance of $337 million at December 25, 2004 and $359 million at December 27, 2003 is
included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives, see “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Other marketplace spending includes the costs of advertising and other marketing activities and is reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses were $1.7 billion in 2004, $1.6 billion
in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:

•

media and personal service prepayments,

•

promotional materials in inventory, and

•

production costs of future media advertising.

Deferred advertising costs of $137 million at year-end 2004 and 2003 are classified as prepaid expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Distribution Costs

Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, are reported as
selling, general and administrative expenses for DSD distribution systems. For our other distribution systems, these costs are reported in cost of sales. Shipping and handling expenses classified as selling, general and administrative expenses were
$3.3 billion in 2004, $3.0 billion in 2003 and $2.8 billion in 2002.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Commitments and Contingencies

We are
subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is
probable and estimable. For additional information on our commitments, see

Note 9.

Note 3 — Impairment and Restructuring Charges and Merger-Related Costs

Impairment and Restructuring Charges

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we incurred a charge of $150 million ($96 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) in conjunction with the consolidation of FLNA’s manufacturing network as part of its ongoing
productivity program. Of this charge, $93 million relates to asset impairment, primarily reflecting the closure of four U.S. plants. Production from these plants has been redeployed to other FLNA facilities in the U.S. The remaining $57 million
includes employee-related costs of $29 million, contract termination costs of $8 million and other exit costs of $20 million. Employee-related costs primarily reflect the termination costs for approximately 700 employees. As of December 25, 2004,
substantially all terminations have occurred. Through December 25, 2004, we have paid $27 million, incurred non-cash charges of $8 million, leaving a remaining accrual of $22 million. This accrual is included in other current liabilities and
payments are expected through mid-year 2006.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we
incurred a charge of $147 million ($100 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) in conjunction with actions taken to streamline our North American divisions and PepsiCo International. These actions were taken to increase focus and eliminate
redundancies at PBNA and PI, and to improve the efficiency of the supply chain at FLNA. Of this charge, $81 million related to asset impairment, reflecting $57 million for the closure of a snack plant in Kentucky, the retirement of snack
manufacturing lines in Maryland and Arkansas and $24 million for the closure of a PBNA office building in Florida. The remaining $66 million included employee-related costs of $54 million and facility and other exit costs of $12 million.
Employee-related costs primarily reflect the termination costs for approximately 850 sales, distribution, manufacturing, research and marketing employees. As of December 25, 2004, all terminations have occurred and substantially no accrual remains.


Merger-Related Costs

In connection with the Quaker merger in 2001, we recognized merger-related costs of $59 million ($42 million after-tax or $0.02 per share)
and $224 million ($190 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) in 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 25, 2004, we had related accruals of $34 million (primarily employee-related) which are included within other current liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Note 4 — Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets

Depreciation and amortization are
recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based
on 2004 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be $141 million in 2005, $140 million in 2006, $24 million in 2007, $23 million in 2008 and $22 million in 2009.

Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances,
if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether
events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. For additional unaudited information on our amortizable brand policies, see “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.


Nonamortizable Intangible Assets

Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure that discounted future cash flows continue to exceed
the related book value. A perpetual brand is impaired if its book value exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. A reporting unit can be a division or business
within a division. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down based on its discounted future cash flows to fair value. No impairment charges resulted from the required impairment evaluations. The
change in the book value of nonamortizable intangible assets during 2004 is as follows:


Note 5 — Income Taxes


For additional unaudited information
on our income tax policies, including our reserves for income taxes, see “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Carryforwards, Credits and Allowances

Operating loss carryforwards totaling $4.3 billion at year-end 2004 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable
income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.1 billion in 2005, $3.1 billion between 2006 and 2024 and $1.1 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, certain tax credits generated in prior periods of approximately $49.3
million are available to reduce certain foreign tax liabilities through 2011. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or
credit.

Tax Benefit from Discontinued Operations

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we reached agreement with the taxing authorities for an open
issue related to our discontinued restaurant operations which resulted in a tax benefit of $38 million or $0.02 per share.

Undistributed International Earnings

At December 25, 2004, we had approximately $11.9 billion of undistributed international earnings. We have not recognized any U.S. tax expense on these earnings, since we
intend to reinvest the earnings outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future, subject to the opportunity afforded us as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), which was signed by the President on October 22, 2004. The AJCA creates
a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed international earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret
certain provisions in the AJCA. Therefore, we have not decided on whether, or to what extent, we might repatriate undistributed foreign earnings to the U.S. Until further guidance is available from the Treasury Department, or possibly from Congress,
it is difficult to fully quantify


the impact of the AJCA if we were to take advantage of that legislation. Based on our analysis to date, however, the maximum amount that we can repatriate
under the AJCA is $7.5 billion, which would result in a tax liability of approximately $475 million based on our expectation of how the AJCA will be interpreted. We expect to finalize our assessment of the opportunity presented by the AJCA as soon
as further guidance is available, which could be as early as the first or second quarter of 2005.

Note 6 — Stock-Based Compensation

Our
stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. Employees at all levels participate in our stock-based
compensation program. In addition, members of our Board of Directors participate in our stock-based compensation program in connection with their service on our Board. Stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) are granted to employees under
the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), our only active stock-based plan. At year-end 2004, 62 million shares were available for future executive and SharePower grants. For additional unaudited information on our stock-based compensation program,
see “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

SharePower Grants

SharePower
options are awarded under our 2003 LTIP to all eligible employees, based on job level or classification, and in the case of international employees, tenure as well. Options become exercisable after three years and have a 10-year term. In 2004,
SharePower grants represented approximately 38% of our annual employee option grants.

Executive Grants

All senior management and certain
middle management are eligible for LTIP grants. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the day of grant and generally have a 10-year term with vesting after three years. There have been
no reductions to the exercise price of previously issued awards, and any repricing of awards would require approval of our shareholders.

Beginning in 2004, executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance are offered the choice of stock options or RSUs. RSUs also generally vest
after three years of service and each restricted stock unit can be settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period. Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% RSUs. Executives who elect RSUs receive one
RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted. Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets. In 2004, we granted three million RSUs with a
weighted-average fair value of $47.28.


Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes model to measure stock-based
compensation expense at the date of grant. Two of our anchor bottlers, PBG and PAS, will be adopting SFAS 123R in 2005. They are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 123R on their respective financial statements, which will impact our bottling
equity income. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions include:

Our Stock Option Activity

(a)

Stock options outstanding and
exercisable at December 25, 2004

(a)

(a)

Options are in thousands and include options previously granted under Quaker plans. No additional options or shares may be granted under the Quaker plans.

(b)

Weighted-average exercise price.

(c)

Weighted-average contractual life remaining in years.


Note 7 – Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans

Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S. and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. U.S. retirees are also eligible for
medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing
the remainder up to the total cost. We use a September 30 measurement date and all plan assets and liabilities are reported as of that date. The cost or benefit of plan changes which increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior
service cost) is included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits.

The Medicare Act was signed into law in December 2003 and we applied the provisions of the Medicare Act to our plans in 2004. The Medicare Act provides a subsidy for
sponsors of retiree medical plans who offer drug benefits equivalent to those provided under Medicare. Our 2004 retiree medical costs were $7 million lower as a result of the Medicare Act and our 2004 liability was reduced by $80 million. We expect
our 2005 retiree medical costs to be approximately $10 million lower as a result of the Medicare Act. Further guidance on the Medicare Act is pending which could impact our previously recognized amounts.

For additional unaudited information on our pension and retiree medical plans and related
accounting policies and assumptions, see “

Our Critical Accounting Policies

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.



Of the total projected pension benefit
liability at year-end 2004, $637 million relates to plans that we do not fund because of unfavorable tax treatment.

Future Benefit Payments

Our estimated future benefit payments to beneficiaries are as follows:






2010-14

Pension

$


$


$


$


$


$

1,855

Retiree medical

$


$


$


$


$


$


These benefit payments to
beneficiaries include payments made from both funded and unfunded pension plans. The above payments exclude any discretionary contributions we may make. We expect such contributions to be approximately $400 million in 2005.


Pension Assets

The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience, our pension plan investment guidelines, and our expectations for long-term rates of
return. Our pension plan investment guidelines are established based upon an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. Our target allocation for 2005 and actual pension plan asset allocation are
as follows:

Pension assets include approximately
5.5 million shares of PepsiCo common stock with a market value of $267 million in 2004, and 5.5 million shares with a market value of $251 million in 2003. Our investment policy limits the investment in PepsiCo stock at the time of investment to 10%
of the fair value of plan assets.

Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates

An average increase of 11% in the cost of covered retiree medical
benefits is assumed for 2005. This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 5% in 2010 and thereafter. These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability. However, the cap on
our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact. A 1 percentage point change in the assumed health care trend rate would have the following effects:

Savings Plan

Our U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, which are
voluntary defined contribution plans. The plans are designed to provide employees with retirement savings and strengthen their incentive to build shareholder value. We make matching contributions on a portion of eligible pay based on years of
service. In 2004, our contribution was $35 million.


Note 8 — Noncontrolled Bottling Affiliates

Our most significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates are The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) and PepsiAmericas (PAS). Approximately 10% of our net revenue reflects sales to PBG.

The Pepsi Bottling Group

In addition to approximately 42% of PBG’s outstanding common stock that we own at year-end 2004, we own 100% of PBG’s class B common stock and approximately 7%
of the equity of Bottling Group, LLC, PBG’s principal operating subsidiary. This gives us economic ownership of approximately 46% of PBG’s combined operations. PBG’s summarized financial information is as follows:

In December 2002, PBG acquired
Pepsi-Gemex, a franchise bottler in Mexico, in which we previously held a 34% ownership interest. The table above includes the results of Pepsi-Gemex from the transaction date forward.

Our investment in PBG, which includes the related goodwill, was $320 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at
year-end 2004. Based upon the quoted closing price of PBG shares at year-end 2004, the calculated market value of our shares in PBG, excluding our investment in Bottling Group, LLC, exceeded our investment balance by approximately $1.7 billion.


PepsiAmericas

At year-end 2004, we owned approximately 41% of PepsiAmericas and their summarized financial information is as follows:

Our investment in PAS, which includes
the related goodwill, was $253 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year-end 2004. Based upon the quoted closing price of PAS shares at year-end 2004, the calculated market value of our shares in PepsiAmericas exceeded
our investment balance by approximately $277 million.

In December 2004, PAS
announced their acquisition of a regional bottler, Central Investment Corporation, for $340 million.

Related Party Transactions

Our
significant related party transactions involve our noncontrolled bottling affiliates. We sell concentrate to these affiliates that is used in the production of carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages. We also sell certain finished goods
to these affiliates and we receive royalties for the use of our trademarks for certain products. Sales of concentrate and finished goods are reported net of bottler funding. For further unaudited information on these bottlers, see “

Our Customers

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis. These transactions with our bottling affiliates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows:

Such amounts are settled on terms
consistent with other trade receivables and payables. See

Note 9

regarding our guarantee of certain PBG debt.


In addition, we coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the negotiation and purchase of sweeteners and other raw materials
requirements for certain of our bottlers with suppliers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, these transactions are not reflected in our
consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.

Note 9 — Debt Obligations and Commitments

The interest rates in the above table reflect weighted-average rates as of year-end.

Short-term borrowings are reclassified to long-term when we have the intent and ability,
through the existence of the unused lines of credit, to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis. At year-end 2004, we maintained $1.5 billion in corporate lines of credit subject to normal banking terms and conditions. These credit
facilities support short-term debt issuances and remained unused as of December 25, 2004. Of the $1.5 billion, $750 million expires in June 2005 with the remaining $750 million expiring in June 2009. Upon consent of PepsiCo and the lenders, these
facilities can be extended an additional year. In addition, $267 million of our debt was outstanding on various lines of credit maintained for our international divisions. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and
are committed to the extent of our borrowings.

Interest Rate Swaps

We entered into interest rate swaps in 2004 to effectively change the
interest rate of a specific debt issuance from a fixed rate to a variable rate. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps outstanding at December 25, 2004 was $500 million. The interest rate received was 3.2% and the weighted-average interest
rate paid was 1.7%. The variable weighted-average interest rate that we pay is linked to LIBOR and is subject to change. The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the debt they modify. The swaps terminate in 2007.


At December 25, 2004, approximately 67% of total debt, after the impact of the associated interest rate swaps, was
exposed to variable interest rates, compared to 43% at December 27, 2003. In addition to variable rate long-term debt, all debt with maturities of less than one year is categorized as variable for purposes of this measure.

Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps

In 2004, we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to hedge the currency exposure
on U.S. dollar denominated debt of $50 million held by a foreign affiliate. The terms of this swap match the terms of the debt it modifies. The swap terminates in 2008. The unrealized loss related to this swap was $3 million at December 25, 2004,
resulting in a U.S. dollar liability of $53 million.

Long-Term
Contractual Commitments

(a)

Excludes current maturities of long-term debt of $160 million which are classified within current liabilities.

(b)

Includes approximately $30 million of long-term commitments which are reflected in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The above table reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 25, 2004 based on
year-end foreign exchange rates.

Most long-term contractual commitments,
except for our long-term debt obligations, are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Non-cancelable operating leases primarily represent building leases. Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for oranges and orange juices to
be used for our Tropicana brand beverages. Non-cancelable marketing commitments primarily are for sports marketing and with our fountain customers. Bottler funding is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an
annual basis. See

Note 7

regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations and discussion below regarding our commitments to noncontrolled bottling affiliates and former restaurant operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements, other than in
the normal course of business, nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our bottlers, noncontrolled affiliates or third parties. However, certain guarantees were necessary to


facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us. In connection with these transactions, we have guaranteed $2.3 billion of
Bottling Group, LLC’s long-term debt through 2012 and $39 million of YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM) outstanding obligations, primarily property leases. The terms of our Bottling Group, LLC debt guarantee are intended to preserve the structure of
PBG’s separation from us and our payment obligation would be triggered if Bottling Group, LLC failed to perform under these debt obligations or the structure significantly changed. Our guarantees of certain obligations ensured YUM’s
continued use of certain properties. These guarantees would require our cash payment if YUM failed to perform under these lease obligations.

See “

Our Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our borrowings.

Note 10 — Risk Management

We are exposed to
the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in:

•

commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;

•

foreign exchange risks;

•

interest rates;

•

stock prices; and

•

discount rates, affecting the measurement of our pension and retiree medical liabilities.

In the normal course of business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivative instruments
designated as cash flow and fair value hedges. See “

Our Business Risks

” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our business risks.

For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are generally deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders’ equity until the underlying hedged
item is recognized in net income. For fair value hedges, changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure. As a result, any change in
the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items. Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not
offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. If the derivative instrument is terminated, we continue to defer the related gain or loss and include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item. Upon determination that
the underlying hedged item will not be part of an actual transaction, we recognize the related gain or loss in net income in that period. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we limit our exposure to
individual counterparties to manage credit risk.


Commodity Prices

We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we
operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and cash flow hedges. We use cash flow hedges, with terms of no more than two years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a
portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for corn, heating oil and natural gas. Any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately. However, our commodity hedges have not had any significant ineffectiveness. We classify both the earnings
and cash flow impact from these hedges consistent with the underlying hedged item. During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify gains of less than $1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.

Foreign Exchange

Our operations outside of the U.S. generate over a third of our net revenue of which Mexico, the United Kingdom and Canada comprise nearly
20%. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency risks from unforeseen economic changes and political unrest. On occasion, we enter into hedges, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years, to reduce the effect of foreign
exchange rates. Ineffectiveness on these hedges has not been material.

Interest Rates

We centrally manage our debt and
investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We may use interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange
risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and
maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.

These swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties, are settled on a net basis and are of relatively short
duration.

Stock Prices

The portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on certain market indices
and on our stock price is subject to market risk. We hold mutual fund investments and prepaid forward contracts to manage this risk. Changes in the fair value of these investments and contracts are recognized immediately in earnings and are offset
by changes in the related compensation liability.


Fair Value

All derivative instruments are recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The fair value of our derivative instruments is
generally based on quoted market prices. Book and fair values of our derivative and financial instruments are as follows:

Included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet under the captions noted above or as indicated below.

(a)

Book value approximates fair value due to the short maturity.

(b)

Principally short-term time deposits and includes $118 million at December 25, 2004 and $103 million at December 27, 2003 of mutual fund investments used to manage a portion of
market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.

(c)

Includes contracts not designated as hedges and reported within current assets and other assets.

(d)

Includes contracts not designated as hedges and reported within current liabilities and other liabilities.

(e)

Included within long-term debt.

This table excludes guarantees, including our guarantee of $2.3 billion of Bottling Group, LLC’s long-term debt. The guarantee had a fair value of $46 million at
December 25, 2004 and $35 million at December 27, 2003 based on an external estimate of the cost to us of transferring the liability to an independent financial institution. See

Note 9

for additional information on our guarantees.

Note 11 — Net Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations

Basic net income per common share is net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is calculated using
the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares. Options to purchase 7.0 million
shares in 2004, 49.0 million shares in 2003 and 37.9 million shares in 2002 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were


out-of-the-money. Out-of-the-money options had average exercise prices of $52.88 in 2004, $48.27 in 2003 and $48.29 in 2002.

The computations of basic and diluted net income per common share from continuing operations
are as follows:

(a)

Weighted average common shares outstanding.

Note 12 — Preferred and Common Stock

As of December 25, 2004, there were 3.6 billion shares of common stock and three million shares of convertible preferred stock authorized. The preferred stock was issued only for an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) established by Quaker
and these shares are redeemable by the ESOP participants. The preferred stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of $5.46 per share. At year-end 2004, there were 803,953 preferred shares issued and 424,853 shares outstanding. Each share is
convertible at the option of the holder into 4.9625 shares of common stock. The preferred shares may be called by us upon written notice at $78 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

As of December 25, 2004, 0.4 million outstanding shares of preferred stock with a fair value
of $110 million and 18 million shares of common stock were held in the accounts of ESOP participants. Quaker made the final award to its ESOP plan in June 2001.


Note 13 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive income is a measure of income which includes both net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other comprehensive loss results from items deferred on the balance sheet in shareholders’
equity. Other comprehensive income was $381 million in 2004, $405 million in 2003, and other comprehensive loss was $26 million in 2002. The accumulated balances for each component of other comprehensive loss were as follows:

(a)

Includes $6 million gain in 2004, $8 million gain in 2003 and $4 million loss in 2002 for our share of our equity investees’ accumulated derivative activity. Deferred losses
reclassified into earnings were $10 million in 2004, no impact in 2003, and $2 million in 2002.

(b)

Net of taxes of $77 million in 2004, $67 million in 2003 and $72 million in 2002. Also, includes $121 million in 2004, $110 million in 2003 and $99 million in 2002 for our share of
our equity investees’ minimum pension liability adjustments.

N

ote 14 — Supplemental Financial Information


(a)

Includes accounts written off.

(b)

Includes collections of previously written off accounts and currency translation effects.

(c)

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average, first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. Approximately 16% in
2004 and 10% in 2003 of the inventory cost was computed using the LIFO method. The differences between LIFO and FIFO methods of valuing these inventories are not material.

(d)

Includes our acquisition of the Wotsits brand in the United Kingdom for $228 million in 2002.


Management’s Responsibility for Financial Reporting

To Our Shareholders:

At PepsiCo, our actions – the actions of
all our associates – are governed by our Worldwide Code of Conduct. This code is clearly aligned with our stated values – a commitment to sustained growth, through empowered people, operating with responsibility and building trust. Both
the code and our core values enable us to operate with integrity – both within the letter and the spirit of the law. Our code of conduct is reinforced consistently at all levels and in all countries. We have maintained strong governance
policies and practices for many years.

The management of PepsiCo is
responsible for the objectivity and integrity of our consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has engaged independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, to audit our consolidated financial statements
and they have expressed an unqualified opinion.

We are committed to providing
timely, accurate and understandable information to investors. This encompasses the following.

Maintaining strong controls over financial reporting.

Our system of internal control is based on the control criteria framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission published
in their report titled,

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and accurately recorded; that assets are safeguarded; and that
accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements that conform in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. We monitor these internal controls through self-assessments and
an ongoing program of internal audits. Our internal controls are reinforced through our Worldwide Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law.

Exerting rigorous oversight of the business.

We continuously review our business
results and strategies. This encompasses financial discipline in our strategic and daily business decisions. Our Executive Committee is actively involved – from understanding strategies and alternatives to reviewing key initiatives and
financial performance. The intent is to ensure we remain objective in our assessments, constructively challenge our approach to potential business opportunities and issues, and monitor results and controls.

Engaging strong and effective Corporate Governance from our Board of Directors.

We
have an active, capable and diligent Board that meets the required standards for independence, and we welcome the Board’s oversight as a representative of our shareholders. Our Audit Committee comprises independent directors with the financial
literacy, knowledge and experience to provide appropriate oversight. We review our critical accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters with them and encourage their direct communication with KPMG LLP, with our General
Auditor, and


with our General Counsel. We have recently named a senior compliance officer to lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.

Providing investors with financial results that are complete, transparent and
understandable.

The consolidated financial statements and financial information included in this report are the responsibility of management. This includes preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S., which require estimates based on management’s best judgment.

PepsiCo has a strong history of doing what’s right.

We realize that great companies are built on trust, strong ethical standards and principles. Our financial results are delivered from that culture of accountability, and we
take responsibility for the quality and accuracy of our financial reporting.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders

PepsiCo, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003
and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Cash Flows and Common Shareholders’ Equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2004. We have also audited management’s assessment, included in

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

appearing under

Item 9A

, that PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). PepsiCo, Inc.’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of
PepsiCo, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2004, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that PepsiCo, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 25, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Furthermore, in our opinion, PepsiCo, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION

The following table provides information as of December 25, 2004 with respect to the shares of PepsiCo Common Stock that may be issued under our equity
compensation plans.

(1)

As of May 7, 2003, the shareholder-approved 2003 LTIP superseded all of our other equity compensation plans and is the only equity compensation plan under which future awards are
permitted. All of our other equity compensation plans were terminated on May 7, 2003. The 2003 LTIP permits the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and restricted stock and/or performance units, which may be settled
in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock. As approved by shareholders, the 2003 LTIP authorizes a number of shares for issuance equal to 70,000,000 plus the number of shares underlying awards issued under the Company’s other equity compensation plans
which are canceled or expire after May 7, 2003; provided, however, that the number of shares authorized under the 2003 LTIP will not exceed 85,000,000.

(2)

Includes the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2003 LTIP”), the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and the 1987 Incentive Plan.


(3)

This amount includes 2,921,826 restricted stock units that, if and when vested, will be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock.

(4)

Includes the 1995 Stock Option Incentive Plan, the SharePower Stock Option Plan, and the Director Stock Plan, each of which is described below.

(5)

The table does not include information for equity compensation plans assumed by PepsiCo in connection with PepsiCo’s merger with The Quaker Oats Company. Those plans include
the Quaker Long Term Incentive Plan of 1990, the Quaker Long Term Incentive Plan of 1999 and the Quaker Stock Compensation Plan for Outside Directors (collectively, the “Quaker Plans”). As of December 25, 2004, a total of 3,755,636 shares
of PepsiCo Common Stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options which were granted under the Quaker Plans prior to the merger with PepsiCo. The weighted average exercise price of those options is $22.76 per share. An additional 63,326
shares of PepsiCo Common Stock which are related to awards issued under the Quaker Plans prior to the merger have been deferred and will be issued in the future. No additional options or shares may be granted under the Quaker Plans.

(6)

For options only.

1995 Stock Option Incentive Plan (“SOIP”).

The SOIP was adopted by the Board of Directors on July 27, 1995. Under the SOIP, stock options were granted to middle management employees generally
based on a multiple of base salary. SOIP options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of PepsiCo Common Stock on the date of grant. SOIP options generally become exercisable at the end of three years and have a ten-year
term. At year-end 2004, options covering 22,552,096 shares of PepsiCo Common Stock were outstanding under the SOIP. As of May 7, 2003 the SOIP was terminated. The SOIP is included as Exhibit 10.14 in our 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2003.

SharePower
Stock Option Plan.

SharePower was adopted by the Board of Directors on July 1, 1989. Under SharePower, options were generally granted each year to virtually all of our full-time employees based on a formula tied to annual earnings and
tenure. Each year, the Board of Directors authorized the number of shares required to grant options under the SharePower formula. SharePower options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of PepsiCo Common Stock on the
date of grant. SharePower options generally become exercisable after three years and have a ten-year term. At year-end 2004, options covering 35,278,252 shares of PepsiCo Common Stock were outstanding under SharePower. As of May 7, 2003, the
SharePower plan was terminated and superseded by the 2003 LTIP, from which all future SharePower awards will be made. The SharePower plan is included as Exhibit 10.13 in our 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on March 7, 2003.

Director Stock Plan.

The Director
Stock Plan was adopted by the disinterested members of the Board of Directors on July 28, 1988. Under the Director Stock Plan, stock options were granted and shares of PepsiCo Common Stock were issued to non-employee directors. Options granted under
the plan were immediately exercisable and have a ten-year term. As of year-end 2004, options covering 504,674 shares of PepsiCo Common Stock were outstanding under the Director Stock Plan. The Director Stock Plan is


included in Post-Effective Amendment No. 6 to the Form S-8 related to such plan, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 4, 2002. As
of May 7, 2003, the Director Stock Plan was terminated and superseded by the 2003 LTIP, from which all future Director stock options will be granted.

Information on the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock beneficially owned by each director and by all directors and officers as a group is contained under the
caption “Ownership of PepsiCo Common Stock by Directors and Executive Officers” in our Proxy Statement for our 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference. As far as we know, no person beneficially owns more
