Unless otherwise indicated, the information under Items 1, 1A and 2 is as of January 1, 2008.

Item 1.

Business

General

United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world and our network consists of 697 rental locations in the United States, Canada and
Mexico. We offer for rent over 2,900 classes of rental equipment, including heavy machines and hand tools, to customers that include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and others. In 2007, we
generated revenue of $3.7 billion, including $2.6 billion of equipment rental revenue.

As of December 31, 2007, our fleet of rental
equipment included over 260,000 units having an original purchase price (based on initial consideration paid) of $4.2 billion, as compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The fleet includes:

•

General construction and industrial equipment,

such as backhoes, skid-steer loaders, forklifts, earth moving equipment, material handling equipment,
compressors, pumps and generators;

•

Aerial work platforms

, such as scissor lifts and boom lifts;

•

General tools and light equipment

, such as pressure washers, water pumps, heaters and hand tools; and

•

Trench safety equipment

for underground work, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers
and line testing equipment.

In addition to renting equipment, we sell new and used rental equipment as well as related
contractor supplies, parts and service.

Strategy

In the second half of 2007, in response to internal analyses and a study we commissioned from a nationally-recognized consulting firm, we began to implement a change in strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher
margins, while also continuing to generate significant cash flow. The three key elements of this strategy are: refocusing our employees and sales representatives on our core rental business; optimizing the management of our rental fleet; and
reducing our operating costs.


We believe this strategy, coupled with our broad geographic footprint, extensive rental fleet, advanced
information technology systems, disciplined purchasing power, industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service, will enable us to strengthen our leadership position in the equipment rental industry and improve our returns to
shareholders. In particular, we plan to achieve our objectives by:

Optimizing Our Field Operations.

We intend to continue the
process of analyzing and optimizing our field operations in order to improve fleet allocation, service and delivery and sales management efforts. We expect this process will create opportunities for rental location closures as fleet assets are moved
from low-return locations to high-return locations, as well as additional cost-saving opportunities from the consolidation of administrative and back-office functions. We believe optimizing our field operations will increase equipment utilization
and reduce operating costs.

Reducing Operating Costs.

In an effort to bring our cost structure in line with those of other leading
equipment rental companies, in the spring of 2007 we undertook a thorough review of our back-office functions related to the general and administrative aspects of our business in order to identify opportunities for increased efficiencies. As a
result of this process, we identified a number of opportunities to consolidate duplicative functions, outsource certain back-office operations and automate processes. As a result, we have implemented a headcount reduction program that, as of
December 31, 2007, had achieved a 9 percent workforce reduction as compared to December 31, 2006, and undertaken specific initiatives to reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of goods sold.

Accelerating Sourcing Initiatives.

Our rental equipment purchases have been centralized for many years which we believe has enabled us to
negotiate more favorable pricing and other terms from our equipment providers. We launched a strategic sourcing initiative in 2006 that was designed to centralize our non-equipment purchases. We believe that centralizing the procurement of these
items will allow us to leverage our significant purchasing power to obtain better pricing and/or terms from our suppliers. To date, we have realized approximately $22 million in cumulative savings across a wide range of products, and we expect
additional savings associated with this initiative in 2008.

Optimizing Time Utilization.

We continue to reassess existing fleet
investments and have recently realigned certain of our incentive programs to reward equipment sharing across districts and increase the time utilization of our rental fleet. Additionally, we intend to better allocate resources, including limited
growth capital, to where there is strong customer demand, resulting in fleet rationalization opportunities. By coupling such initiatives with an increased focus on preventative maintenance and improved turn-around time for returned equipment, we
believe we can further increase the time utilization of our rental fleet, which was up 2.5 percentage points year-over-year in 2007.

Refocusing Contractor Supplies Business.

We sell a variety of contractor supplies, such as construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies, through several channels, including our sales representatives, rental
branches and U.S. and Canadian product catalogues. Although revenues from the contractor supplies business grew from $125 million in 2002 to $378 million in 2007, this business has required us to maintain significant volumes of inventory in order to
meet customer demand and carries a higher cost structure relative to our core equipment rental business. In 2007, the gross margin for our contractor supplies business was 19.0 percent as compared to 38.7 percent for equipment rentals.

We have refocused our contractor supplies business and positioned it more clearly as a complementary offering to our equipment rental business. We
expect this to result in productivity improvements within our sales force, thus helping to improve the utilization of our rental fleet. As part of this initiative, we are reducing the number of stock keeping units associated with these operations,
especially in lower margin commodity categories. Additionally, we have recently closed three of our nine distribution centers and we intend to close an additional two distribution centers in the first half of 2008. We expect these changes will
reduce our revenues associated with contractor supplies, but improve our margins.


Industry Overview

Based on industry sources, we estimate that the U.S. equipment rental industry had total revenues of approximately $37 billion in 2007. This represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent since
1990.

Our principal end-market for rental equipment is private non-residential construction, and our business is particularly sensitive to
changes in activity in this end-market. According to U.S. Department of Commerce data (which has not been adjusted for inflation), private non-residential construction activity increased 5.0 percent in 2005 compared to 2004, increased 16.2 percent
in 2006 compared with 2005 and increased 16.7 percent in 2007 compared with 2006. Reflecting current economic conditions, we and other forecasters expect this growth to slow significantly in 2008—most likely flat as compared to 2007 or low
single digit growth.

Approximately 10 percent of our revenues have historically been derived from private residential construction, where
activity decreased 18.3 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 (based on the same Department of Commerce data), with further decreases expected in 2008. This market primarily impacts our southwest and southeast regions.

We believe that long-term industry growth, in addition to reflecting general economic expansion, is driven by an end-user market that increasingly
recognizes the many advantages of renting equipment rather than owning. Customers recognize that by renting they can:

•

avoid the large capital investment required for equipment purchases;

•

access a broad selection of equipment and select the equipment best suited for each particular job;

•

reduce storage, maintenance and transportation costs; and

•

access the latest technology without investing in new equipment.

While the construction industry has to date been the principal user of rental equipment, industrial companies, utilities and others are increasingly using rental equipment for plant maintenance, plant changeovers and
other operations requiring the periodic use of equipment. We believe that over the long-term, increasing rentals by governmental entities and the industrial sector could become a more significant factor in driving our industry’s growth.

Competitive Advantages

We believe
that we benefit from the following competitive advantages:

Large and Diverse Rental Fleet

. Our rental fleet is the largest
and most comprehensive in the industry, which allows us to:

•

serve a diverse customer base and reduce our dependence on any particular customer or group of customers; and

•

serve large customers that require substantial quantities and/or wide varieties of equipment.

Significant Purchasing Power

. We purchase large amounts of equipment, contractor supplies and other items, which enables us to negotiate
favorable pricing, warranty and other terms with our vendors.

Operating Efficiencies

. We benefit from the following
operating efficiencies:

•

Equipment Sharing Among Branches

. We generally group our branches into districts of 6 to 12 locations that are in the same geographic area. Each branch
within a district can access all available equipment in the district. This increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches. Districts report into a region structure where
management teams identify additional opportunities for equipment sharing and fleet transfers.


•

Ability to Transfer Equipment Among Branches

. The size of our branch network gives us the ability to take advantage of strength at a particular branch or in
a particular region by transferring underutilized equipment from weaker areas to stronger areas.

•

National Call Center

. We have established a national call center in Tampa, Florida, to handle all 1-800-UR-RENTS telephone calls without having to route them
to individual branches. This provides us with the ability to provide a more uniform quality experience to customers, manage fleet sharing more effectively and free up branch employee time.

•

Consolidation of Common Functions

. We reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our branches, such as payroll, accounts payable,
benefits and risk management, information technology and credit and collection.

Information Technology
Systems

. We have a wide variety of information technology systems, some proprietary and some licensed, that support our operations. This information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions,
respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches. We have an in-house team of information technology specialists that support our systems.

Strong Brand Recognition

. We have strong brand recognition, which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty.

Geographic and Customer Diversity

. We have 697 rental locations in 48 states, ten Canadian provinces and Mexico and serve customers that
range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. We believe that our geographic and customer diversity provide us with many advantages including: (i) enabling us to better serve National Account customers with multiple
locations, (ii) helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across North America, (iii) reducing our dependence on any particular customer and (iv) reducing the impact that
fluctuations in regional economic conditions have on our overall financial performance.

National Account Program

. Our
National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. We offer our National Account customers the benefits of a consistent level of
service across North America, a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs. We currently serve approximately 1,500 National Account customers as well as approximately 200 agencies within the United States
government. Combined revenues from National Account customers and government agencies have increased to approximately $775 million in 2007 from approximately $700 million in 2006 and approximately $625 million in 2005, reflecting the growth and
success of this program.

Strong and Motivated Branch Management

. Each of our full service branches has a branch manager who
is supervised by a district manager from one of our 92 districts and a vice president from one of our 11 regions. We believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them, within budgetary
guidelines, to make day-to-day decisions concerning branch matters. Each region office has a management team that monitors branch, district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls, including performance benchmarks and detailed
monthly operating reviews.

Employee Training Programs

.

We are dedicated to providing training and development to our
employees. In 2007, our employees enhanced their skills through over 485,000 hours of training. Many employees participated in one of eight, week-long, programs held in 2007 at our training facility located at our corporate headquarters. In addition
to these training sessions, our employees are provided equipment-related training from our suppliers as well as on-line eLearning courses covering a variety of subjects.

Risk Management and Safety Programs

. We believe that we have one of the most comprehensive risk management and safety programs in the industry. Our risk management department is staffed by experienced


professionals and is responsible for implementing our safety programs and procedures, developing our employee and customer training programs and, in
coordination with third party professionals, managing any claims against us.

Segment Information

Our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety, pump and power. Segment financial information is presented in note 4 to our consolidated
financial statements. The general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial, industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities. The general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial
companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities and homeowners. The general rentals segment operates throughout the United States and Canada and has one location in Mexico. The trench safety, pump and power segment includes the rental of

Products and Services

Our principal products and services are described below.

Equipment Rental

. We offer for rent over 2,900 classes of rental equipment on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis. The types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial
equipment; aerial work platforms; trench safety equipment; and general tools and light equipment. The weighted-average age of our fleet was 38.0 months at December 31, 2007 as compared to 39.2 months at December 31, 2006.

Used Equipment Sales

.

We routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance
costs as well as the age, composition and size of our fleet. We also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this equipment. The rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors, including
changing general economic conditions, growth opportunities, the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer requirements and local demand, and the age of the fleet.

We principally sell used equipment through our national sales force, which can access many resale markets across North America. We also sell used equipment through our website, which includes an online database of
used equipment available for sale. In addition, we hold United Rentals Certified Auctions on eBay to provide customers with another convenient online tool for purchasing used equipment.

New Equipment Sales

. We sell equipment for many leading equipment manufacturers. The manufacturers that we represent and the brands that we
carry include: Genie, JLG and Skyjack (aerial lifts); Multiquip, Wacker, and Honda USA (compaction equipment, generators and pumps); Sullair (compressors); Skytrak and Lull (rough terrain reach forklifts); John Deere and Takeuchi (skid-steer loaders
and mini-excavators); Terex (telehandlers); and DeWalt (generators). The type of new equipment that we sell varies by location.

Contractor Supplies Sales

. We sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies. Our target customers for contractor supplies are our existing rental
customers. As previously discussed, we are refocusing our contractor supplies business to position it more clearly as a complementary offering to our equipment rental business.

Service and Other Revenue

. We also offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers. Our
target customers for these types of ancillary services are our current rental customers as well as those who purchase both new and used equipment from our branches.


RENTALMAN

®

and INFOMANAGER

®

Software

. We have two subsidiaries that develop and market software. One of the subsidiaries develops and
markets RENTALMAN

®

, which is an enterprise resource planning application used by ourselves and several of the other largest equipment rental companies. The other subsidiary develops and
markets INFOMANAGER

®

, which provides a complete solution for creating an advanced business intelligence system. INFOMANAGER

®

helps with extracting raw data from transactional applications and transforming it into meaningful information and saving it in a database that is specifically optimized for analytical use.

Customers

Our customer base is highly diversified
and ranges from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. Our largest customer accounted for less than 1 percent of our revenues in 2007 and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 2 percent of our revenues in 2007.
Historically, we have typically retained over 90 percent of our customer base year-over-year.

Our customer base varies by branch and is
determined by several factors, including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy. Our customers include:

•

construction companies that use equipment for constructing and renovating commercial buildings, warehouses, industrial and manufacturing plants, office parks,
airports, residential developments and other facilities;

•

industrial companies—such as manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders and utilities—that use equipment for plant
maintenance, upgrades, expansion and construction;

•

municipalities that require equipment for a variety of purposes; and

•

homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.

Our business is seasonal, with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months.

Sales and Marketing

We market our products and
services through multiple channels as described below.

Sales Force

. We have over 2,700 sales people, including approximately
1,400 outside sales representatives and 1,300 inside sales people. Our sales people are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs. We have ongoing programs
for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction.

National
Account Program

. Our National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. Our National Account team, which consists of
approximately 50 sales professionals and includes those who service governmental agencies, closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area.

E-Rentals

. Our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, at our E-Rentals portal, which can be found at

unitedrentals.com

. Our customers can also use our UR

data

®

application to access real-time reports on their business
activity with us.

Advertising

. We promote our business through local and national advertising in various media, including
trade publications, yellow pages, the Internet, radio and direct mail. We also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events.


Suppliers

Our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements. This approach is designed to ensure the
terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand. We utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors. We consider product capabilities and industry
position, product liability history and financial strength.

We have been making ongoing efforts to consolidate our vendor base in order to
further increase our purchasing power. We estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 38 percent of our 2007 purchases of equipment for rental or resale, and that our 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 percent of
such purchases. We believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories.

Information
Technology Systems

In support of our rental business, we have advanced information technology systems which facilitate rapid and
informed decision-making and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our AS/400 system located at our data center.
Rental transactions are entered at these workstations and processed on a real-time basis. Management, branch and call center personnel can access the systems 24 hours a day.

These systems:

•

allow management to obtain a wide range of operational and financial data;

•

enable branch personnel to (i) determine equipment availability, (ii) access all equipment within a geographic region and arrange for equipment to be
delivered from anywhere in the region directly to the customer, (iii) monitor business activity on a real-time basis and (iv) obtain customized reports on a wide range of operating and financial data, including equipment utilization,
rental rate trends, maintenance histories and customer transaction histories; and

•

permit customers to access their accounts online.

Our information technology systems and our website are supported by our in-house group of information technology specialists. This group trains our branch personnel; upgrades and customizes our systems; provides
hardware and technology support; operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the day-to-day use of the systems; extends the systems to newly acquired locations; and manages our website.

We have a fully functional back-up facility designed to enable business continuity in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative. This
backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems.

Competition

The equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Our competitors
primarily include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations; regional competitors which operate in one or more states; public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally; and equipment
vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company, we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our
smaller competitors. These advantages include greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to, and in
anticipation of, customer demand. For additional information, see “Competitive Advantages.”


Securities and Exchange Commission Inquiry

As previously reported and as discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report, the Company is the subject of a
non-public, fact-finding inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that appears to relate to a broad range of the Company’s accounting practices prior to 2005 and does not otherwise seem to be confined to a
specific time period. The U.S. Attorney’s office has also requested information from the Company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the SEC inquiry. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC and the U.S. Attorney’s
office.

Environmental and Safety Regulations

Our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, storm water, solid and hazardous wastes and materials, and air
quality. Our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business,

dispose of solid and
hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and above-ground storage tanks located at certain of our locations. Under environmental and safety laws, we may be liable for, among
other things, (i) the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. We incur
ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations.

Employees

We had approximately 10,900 employees at January 1, 2008, as compared to approximately 12,000 at January 1, 2007. Of these, approximately
3,400 are salaried personnel and approximately 7,500 are hourly personnel. Collective bargaining agreements relating to 68 separate locations cover approximately 800 of our employees. We monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and we
consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Terminated Merger Agreement

On July 22, 2007, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with RAM Holdings, Inc. and RAM Acquisition Corp.
(collectively, the “RAM entities”), each an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (“Cerberus”). The Merger Agreement contemplated that the RAM entities would acquire the Company by, among other things, paying $34.50 for
each outstanding share of our common stock. On November 14, 2007, the RAM entities notified us that, although there had not been any material adverse change in our business, in light of current credit market conditions they were not prepared to
proceed with the purchase of the Company on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. On November 19, 2007, we sued the RAM entities in Delaware Chancery Court, seeking specific performance of the Merger Agreement. On December 21, 2007, in an
opinion issued after a bench trial, that Court declined to compel the RAM entities to complete their purchase of the Company. In light of that opinion, on December 23, 2007, we terminated the Merger Agreement and requested and received prompt
payment from the RAM entities of the $100 million termination fee contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Our results of operations and
financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in
this report and our other filings with the SEC. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted.

Decreases in North American construction and industrial activities could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge.

Our rental equipment is used primarily in the non-residential construction industry, which is cyclical in nature. Trench safety, pump
and power equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities. Weakness in our end markets, such as a decline in construction or industrial activity, may lead to a decrease in the demand for our equipment or the
prices that we can charge. Any such decrease could adversely affect our operating results by causing our revenues and gross profit margins to be reduced.

The following factors, among others, may cause weakness in our end markets, either temporarily or long-term:

•

weakness in the economy or the onset of a recession;

•

an increase in the cost of construction materials;

•

an increase in interest rates;

•

adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular region; or

•

terrorism or hostilities involving the United States or Canada.

Our operating results may fluctuate, which could affect the trading value of our securities.

We
expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors, which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities. These factors, in addition to general economic
conditions, include:

•

seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter;

•

changes in the size of our rental fleet and/or in the rate at which we sell our used equipment;

•

changes in non-residential construction spending or government funding for infrastructure and other construction projects;

•

changes in demand for or utilization of our equipment or the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors;

•

commodity price pressures and the resultant increase in the cost of oil and steel to our equipment suppliers;

•

other cost fluctuations, such as costs for employee-related compensation and healthcare benefits;

•

completion of acquisitions, divestitures or recapitalizations;


•

the need to charge against earnings any expenditures relating to a potential acquisition that we determine will not be consummated (such as financing commitment
fees, merger and acquisition advisory fees and professional fees) previously capitalized; or

•

the possible need, from time to time, to record goodwill impairment charges or other write-offs or charges due to a variety of occurrences, such as the adoption of
new accounting standards, rental location divestitures, consolidations or closings, restructurings, the refinancing of existing indebtedness, the impairment of assets or the buy-out of equipment leases.

Our substantial debt exposes us to various risks.

At
December 31, 2007, our total indebtedness was approximately $2.7 billion, including $146 million of subordinated convertible debentures. Our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways. For example, it
will or could:

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;

•

require us to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt service, reducing the funds available for other purposes or otherwise constrain our financial
flexibility;

•

affect our ability to obtain additional financing, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing
indebtedness; or

•

decrease our profitability or cash flow.

Further, if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include:

•

reducing or delaying capital expenditures;

•

limiting our growth;

•

seeking additional capital;

•

selling assets; or

•

restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness.

Even if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations.

A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market
interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. At December 31, 2007, including the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, we had approximately $1.7 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at
variable rates. This amount represents 65 percent of our total indebtedness, excluding our subordinated convertible debentures. In January 2008, we terminated interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $1.2 billion. Had these
swaps been terminated as of December 31, 2007, 18 percent of our total debt (excluding our subordinated convertible debentures) would have been floating rate debt. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
for additional information related to interest rate risk.

Notwithstanding our current indebtedness level, we believe we are able to incur and carry
substantially more debt. If we do so, this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt.

We believe we would
be able to incur and service substantial additional indebtedness in the future, should business conditions or decisions so warrant. Although the terms of our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and


exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our and our
subsidiaries’ current debt levels, the substantial debt risks described above would increase.

We are subject to an ongoing inquiry by the SEC.

We are the subject of a non-public, fact-finding inquiry by the SEC that appears to relate to a broad range of the Company’s
accounting practices prior to 2005 and does not seem otherwise to be confined to a specific time period. In August 2004, we issued a press release and filed a Form 8-K disclosing the existence of the SEC inquiry. In March 2005, our board of
directors formed the Special Committee of independent directors to review matters related to the SEC inquiry. Our board of directors received and acted upon findings of the Special Committee in January 2006. The actions that we took with respect to
the Special Committee’s findings and actions that we took with respect to certain other accounting matters, including the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2003 and 2002, are discussed in our annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 (our “2005 Form 10-K”).

We are cooperating with the SEC in its ongoing
inquiry. The U.S. Attorney’s office has also requested information from the Company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the SEC inquiry. We are also cooperating fully with this office. However, we cannot predict the outcome of
these inquiries or when these matters might be resolved. In July 2007, the staff of the SEC advised us that it intends to seek commission authorization to seek injunctive and monetary relief against us, as well as to engage in settlement discussions
with us.

These matters have the potential to adversely affect us in a number of ways, including the following:

•

we are likely to continue to incur additional expenses in connection with responding to the inquiries, regardless of the outcome, including expenses related to our
indemnification obligations to our directors, officers and certain current and former employees:

•

responding to the inquiries has in the past diverted and may continue to divert the time and attention of our management from normal business operations;

•

charges against, or settlements by, any of our former officers may generate negative publicity and adversely impact the perception of our company; and

•

if proceedings are brought, depending on the outcome, we may be required to pay fines and/or take corrective actions that would adversely affect our operations.

If we are ultimately required to pay significant amounts and/or take significant corrective actions, our results and
liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In addition, regardless of the outcome, the publicity surrounding the inquiries and the potential risks associated with the inquiries could negatively impact the perception of the Company by
investors and others, which could adversely affect the price of our securities, our access to the capital markets and/or our borrowing costs.

We are
subject to certain ongoing class action lawsuits.

Multiple class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company, as described in
greater detail under Item 3—Legal Proceedings. Three complaints were filed following our public announcement of the SEC inquiry. These complaints, which have been consolidated, allege, among other things, that (i) certain of the
Company’s SEC filings and other public statements contained false and misleading statements which resulted in damages to the plaintiffs and the members of the purported class when they purchased the Company’s securities and (ii) the
conduct in connection therewith violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, SEC Rule 10b-5 and, in the case of the individual defendants, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The consolidated amended complaint asserts the same claims and
seeks unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses.


Three complaints were filed following our November 14, 2007 announcement that affiliates of Cerberus
had notified us that they were not prepared to proceed with the purchase of the Company on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. These complaints, which have been consolidated, allege, among other things, that certain of the Company’s
filings with the SEC, including proxy materials in connection with the special meeting of stockholders, and other public statements contained false and misleading statements and/or material omissions relating to the contemplated merger with
affiliates of Cerberus. Each action asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9, and, in the case of the individual defendants, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints seek
unspecified compensatory damages, costs, expenses and fees.

We can give no assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings and, if we do
not prevail, we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts. Further, regardless of the outcome, we may incur significant defense and indemnification costs, and the time and attention of our management may be diverted from
normal business operations. If we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs, damages or settlement amounts, such payments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.

We are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them.

We are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business. These claims include those relating to (i) personal injury or
property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us, (ii) motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and (iii) employment related claims. Further, as described elsewhere in this report, several shareholder
derivative and class action lawsuits have been filed against us. Currently, we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations. However, such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons,
including:

•

our insurance policies, reflecting a program structure that we believe reflects market conditions for companies our size, are often subject to significant
deductibles or self-insured retentions: $2 million per occurrence for each general liability or automobile liability claim, and $1 million per occurrence for each workers’ compensation claim;

•

our director and officer liability insurance policy has no deductible for individual non-indemnifiable loss coverage, but is subject to a $2.5 million
deductible for company reimbursement coverage and all director and officer coverage is subject to certain exclusions;

•

we do not maintain stand-alone coverage for environmental liability (other than legally required underground storage tank coverage), since we believe the cost for
such coverage is high relative to the benefit it provides; and

•

certain types of claims, such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct, which are often alleged in third party lawsuits,
might not be covered by our insurance.

We establish and regularly evaluate our loss reserves to address business
operations claims, or portions thereof, not covered by our insurance policies. To the extent that we are found liable for any significant claims that exceed our established levels of reserves, that cause us to significantly increase such reserves or
that are not otherwise covered by insurance, our liquidity and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the class action and derivative lawsuits against us, and our indemnification costs associated with the SEC and U.S.
Attorney’s office inquiries, may not be fully reimbursable or covered by insurance. It is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms, or
not available at all.

We have made numerous acquisitions in the past, which entail certain risks, as do any growth initiatives, including additional
acquisitions or consolidations, that we may make in the future.

We have historically achieved a substantial portion of our growth
through acquisitions. Although we have not made many acquisitions in recent years, and the making of additional acquisitions is not a planned portion of


our 2008 strategy, we are always open to considering potential acquisitions on a selective basis. From time-to-time we have also approached, or been
approached, to explore consolidation opportunities with other public companies or large privately-held companies.

Whether historical or in
the future, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions. The making of acquisitions entails certain risks, including:

•

unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations;

•

difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company within our existing operations or in maintaining uniform standards;

•

loss of key employees of the acquired company;

•

the failure to achieve anticipated synergies; and

•

strains on management and other personnel time and resources both to research and integrate acquisitions.

We would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash, capital stock, notes and/or assumption of indebtedness. To the extent that our existing
sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance, we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing, which involves its own risks.

We have also spent resources and efforts, apart from acquisitions, in attempting to grow our business operations over the past few years. These efforts place strains on our management and other personnel and resources and require timely and
continued investment in facilities, personnel and financial and management systems and controls. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives, which could result in our
expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues, causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected.

Our
capital stock and charter structures, as well as other factors, may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the Company.

Our Series C preferred and Series D preferred stock, as described in more detail in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, have certain rights that may impact the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the Company.
These provisions include the right of the holders of the Series C preferred to directly elect two directors to our board (subject to reduction if their holdings are reduced). They also include the rights of the holders of both the Series C and
Series D preferred to have their shares redeemed at certain levels providing a guaranteed rate of return on their investment in the event of a board-approved change of control and at certain levels providing a higher guaranteed rate of return, and
other rights (including the right to elect a majority of our board), in the event of a change of control that has not been approved by our board combined with a failure to offer the holders of the preferred stock the redemption rights they would
have in an approved change of control context. As a result, the interests of the holders of our preferred stock may be different from, and affect, those of the holders of our common stock in a change of control scenario. In addition, as described in
note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a stockholders’ rights plan and certain charter provisions, such as the inability for shareholders to act by written consent, that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers
or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company that are not approved by our board. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which under certain circumstances restricts the ability of
a publicly held Delaware corporation to engage in a business combination such as a merger or sale of assets with any stockholder that, together with affiliates, owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock, which
similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction.


Our preferred stock and debt agreements limit our board’s ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or
otherwise return capital to our common stockholders.

The terms of our Series C preferred and Series D preferred stock restrict us from
paying or making any “extraordinary dividend” without the consent of the holders thereof. Generally, this limitation applies to any dividends made on, or tender offers made for, our common stock if the aggregate amount of such dividends
and repurchases would exceed 5 percent of our market capitalization at the time of payment (tested on a rolling 12-month basis). If common stock repurchases are made other than by means of a tender offer, the limitation (inclusive of any common
stock dividends and repurchases through tender offers) is 7.5 percent of our market capitalization (measured and tested the same way), which increases to a 10 percent limitation beginning in early 2009.

Although currently less restrictive in the aggregate amount than the above-described provisions, the indentures governing our high-yield debt and the
agreement governing our credit facility also contain restrictions on making what are known as “restricted payments”—which typically are defined to include most cash payments to common stockholders, whether through dividends or common
stock repurchases.

Turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently
manage our business and execute our strategy.

Our success is dependent, in part, on the experience and skills of our management team,
and competition in our industry and the business world generally for top management talent is significant. Although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages, we can provide no assurances that our efforts to attract and retain senior
management staff will be successful. Moreover, the termination of the Merger Agreement with Cerberus affiliates, the resulting drop in our stock price and our continued operation under the stewardship of an interim chief executive officer have
created perceived uncertainties that may result in increased difficulties and expense in recruiting and retaining employees, particularly senior management. If we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions, or if we
lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion, we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy.

Our cost reduction programs may not achieve the cost savings and operational improvements and efficiencies we expect, and we may have to implement further cost
reduction programs and incur additional related charges.

In 2007, we implemented a workforce reduction program, a strategic sourcing
initiative and other initiatives designed to reduce operating costs and increase organizational efficiencies. Though we have already realized substantial cost savings and operational improvements from these efforts, the extent to which we achieve
our remaining and any additional goals will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Even if we take all of the steps that we expect to take, we may not achieve the cost reduction and operational efficiencies we
anticipate, the reductions and efficiencies we do achieve may not be realized on the timetable we anticipate and there may be productivity, revenue or other consequences resulting from such programs and initiatives that will adversely effect us.
Therefore, the anticipated benefits of our existing and future cost saving initiatives may not be fully realized.

If we are unable to satisfy the
financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings, or we could face other substantial costs.

Under the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility, we are required to, among other things, satisfy certain financial tests relating to:
(a) the interest coverage ratio, (b) the ratio of funded debt to cash flow, (c) the ratio of senior secured debt to tangible assets and (d) the ratio of senior secured debt to cash flow. If we


are unable to satisfy any of these covenants, the lenders could elect to terminate our senior secured credit facility and/or other agreements governing our
debt and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. In such event, unless we were able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace our senior secured credit facility and/or the other agreements governing our debt, we would likely not have
sufficient liquidity for our business needs and we would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above. Even if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity for our
operations. In addition to financial covenants, we are subject to various other covenants in our senior secured credit facility as well as in the other agreements governing our debt, such as a requirement to file our periodic reports with the SEC in
a timely manner. For example, when we were not current with our SEC periodic reports as a result of our restatement process described above, in 2005 we paid in excess of $34 million in consent solicitation fees with respect to our public debt
indentures in order to address non-compliance with such a covenant.

In addition to the risks with respect to covenant non-compliance,
compliance with covenants may restrict our ability to conduct our operations. For instance, these covenants limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, make prepayments of certain indebtedness, pay dividends, make
investments, create liens, make acquisitions, sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions. These covenants could adversely affect our operating results by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility.

If we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business.

If the cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we may borrow under our credit facility and accounts receivable securitization
facility, is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing. However, we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all. If we
are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business, including those relating to purchasing equipment, growth plans and refinancing existing
indebtedness.

Goodwill related to acquisitions represents a substantial portion of our total assets. If the fair value of the goodwill should drop
below the recorded value, we would be required to write-off the excess goodwill.

On December 31, 2007, we had goodwill of $1.4
billion on our balance sheet, which represented approximately 23 percent of our total assets as of such date. This goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the
estimated fair value of the net assets of those businesses. Of the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at December 31, 2007, 94 percent is associated with our general rentals segment and 6 percent is associated with our trench safety, pump
and power segment. We are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually. Our results in 2004 were adversely affected by the write-off of approximately $139 million of goodwill related to our discontinued traffic control operations,
and our results in the preceding two years were also adversely affected by significant goodwill write-offs. Based on the current performance of our general rentals and trench safety, pump and power segments, as well as current market conditions, we
do not currently anticipate significant goodwill write-offs. However, in previous years we recorded significant goodwill write-offs, and we cannot be certain that a future downturn in the business or changes in market conditions will not necessitate
additional write-offs in future periods.

Our industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or
in the prices that we can charge.

The equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Our competitors include small,
independent businesses with one or two rental locations, regional competitors which operate in one or more states, public companies or divisions of public companies, and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to
customers. We may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing


competitors or from new companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by, among other things, decreasing our
rental volumes, depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees.

Disruptions in our information technology systems
could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations.

Our
information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the
magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions.

We are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. If we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our operating results could be adversely affected.

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety
matters. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous wastes and materials, and air quality. Under these laws, we may be liable for, among other things, (i) the costs of investigating and remediating any
contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment, regardless of fault and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. Our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks,
but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and above-ground storage tanks located at certain
of our locations.

Based on conditions currently known to us, we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation and/or compliance
effort will have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain, however, as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become
more stringent. If we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our liquidity and operating results could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of such costs.

Labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers and/or lead to higher labor costs.

We currently have approximately 800 employees that are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 10,100
employees that are not represented by unions. Various unions periodically seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees. Union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages and/or slowdowns or
strikes by certain of our employees, which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers. In addition, these efforts could negatively affect our relationship with certain customers. Further, our labor costs could increase as a result of
the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business.

We believe that one of our competitive
advantages is the mobility of our fleet. Accordingly, we could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us of transporting equipment from one branch to another
branch or one region to another region. A significant or protracted disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


We have operations outside the United States. As a result, we may incur losses from currency conversions and have
higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws.

Our operations in Canada and Mexico are subject
to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates, (ii) the need to comply with foreign laws
and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions, and (iii) the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries.

Properties

As of January 1, 2008, we operated
697 rental locations. Of these locations, 600 are in the United States, 96 are in Canada and one is in Mexico. The number of locations in each state or province is shown in the table below, as well as the number of locations that are general rentals
(GR) and trench safety, pump and power (TPP).

United States


Our branch locations generally include facilities for displaying equipment and, depending on the
location, may include separate areas for equipment service, storage and displaying contractor supplies. We own 159 of our branch locations and lease the other locations. We also lease premises for other purposes such as district and regional offices
and service centers.

We have a fleet of approximately 6,700 vehicles. These vehicles are used for delivery, maintenance and sales
functions. Approximately 70 percent of this fleet is leased and the balance is owned.

Our corporate headquarters are located in Greenwich,
Connecticut, where we occupy approximately 51,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2013. Additionally, we maintain a facility in Shelton, Connecticut, where we occupy 32,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2016. Further, we
maintain a shared-service facility in Tampa, Florida, where we occupy 43,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2011.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

On October 19, 2007, we held a special meeting at which our stockholders were asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (together, the
“Proposal”). The final results of the vote at the special meeting (at which our preferred stock, on an “as converted basis”, voted together with our common stock) were as follows: 77,776,873 shares were voted for the Proposal,
132,107 shares were voted against the Proposal, and 54,385 shares abstained. The shares voted in favor of the Proposal represented approximately 76.8 percent of the total voting power outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, and of those
votes cast, approximately 99.8 percent voted in favor of the Proposal. In addition, in two separate class votes that were also held, all of the outstanding shares of our Series C preferred stock and Series D preferred stock were voted in favor of
the Proposal. As previously reported, on December 23, 2007, we terminated the Merger Agreement and in connection therewith received the $100 million termination fee owed to us pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock trades
on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “URI.” The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the intra-day high and low sale prices for our common stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange.


As of January 1, 2008, there were approximately 301 holders of record of our common stock. We
believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our common stock is held of record in broker “street names.”

Dividend Policy

We have not paid dividends on our
common stock since inception. However, the payment of any future dividends or the authorization of stock repurchases or other recapitalizations will be determined by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing, including our
earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions, stock price and other factors. The terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and the terms of our outstanding
preferred stock, as discussed above, contain certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends on, or effect repurchases of, our common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may only be paid out of capital surplus or current or prior
year’s net profits.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

The following table provides information about purchases of the Company’s common stock by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2007:

(1)

The shares were surrendered to the Company by employees in order to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock. These shares were not acquired pursuant
to any repurchase plan or program.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

Executive Overview

We are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of 697 rental locations in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse, we believe we are
well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over smaller competitors. These advantages include greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers
with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment, and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches.

We offer for rent over 2,900 classes of rental equipment, including construction equipment, industrial and heavy machinery, aerial work platforms, trench safety equipment and homeowner items. Our revenues are derived
from the following sources: equipment rentals, sales of used rental equipment, sales of new equipment, contractor supplies sales and service and other. In 2007, rental equipment revenues represented 70 percent of our total revenues. We expect this
percentage to increase to approximately 77 percent in 2008 as we reposition our contractor supplies business and sell less used equipment.

In the second half of 2007, in response to internal analyses and a study we commissioned from a nationally-recognized consulting firm, we began to implement a change in strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher margins, while also
continuing to generate significant cash flow. The three key elements of this strategy are: refocusing our employees and sales representatives on our core rental business; optimizing the management of our rental fleet; and reducing our operating
costs.

We believe this strategy, coupled with our broad geographic footprint, extensive rental fleet, advanced information technology
systems, disciplined purchasing power, industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service, will enable us to strengthen our leadership position in the equipment rental industry and improve our returns to shareholders. In
particular, we plan to achieve our objectives by:

Optimizing Our Field Operations.

We intend to continue the process of analyzing
and optimizing our field operations in order to improve fleet allocation, service and delivery and sales management efforts. We expect this process will create opportunities for rental location closures as fleet assets are moved from low-return
locations to high-return locations, as well as additional cost-saving opportunities from the consolidation of administrative and back-office functions. We believe optimizing our field operations will increase equipment utilization and reduce
operating costs.

Reducing Operating Costs.

In an effort to bring our cost structure in line with those of other leading equipment
rental companies, in the spring of 2007 we undertook a thorough review of our back-office functions related to the general and administrative aspects of our business in order to identify opportunities for increased efficiencies. As a result of this
process, we identified a number of opportunities to consolidate duplicative functions, outsource certain back-office operations and automate processes. As a result, we have implemented a headcount reduction program that, as of December 31,
2007, had achieved a 9 percent workforce reduction as compared to December 31, 2006, and undertaken specific initiatives to reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of goods sold.

Accelerating Sourcing Initiatives.

Our rental equipment purchases have been centralized for many years which we believe has enabled us to
negotiate more favorable pricing and other terms from our equipment providers. We launched a strategic sourcing initiative in 2006 that was designed to centralize our non-equipment purchases. We believe that centralizing the procurement of these
items will allow us to leverage our significant purchasing power to obtain better pricing and/or terms from our suppliers. To date, we have realized approximately $22 in cumulative savings across a wide range of products, and we expect additional
savings associated with this initiative in 2008.


Optimizing Time Utilization.

We continue to reassess existing fleet investments and have recently
realigned certain of our incentive programs to reward equipment sharing across districts and increase the time utilization of our fleet assets. Additionally, we intend to better allocate resources, including limited growth capital, to where there is
strong customer demand, resulting in fleet rationalization opportunities. By coupling such initiatives with an increased focus on preventative maintenance and improved turn-around time for returned equipment, we believe we can further increase the
time utilization of our fleet, which was up 2.5 percentage points year-over-year in 2007.

Refocusing

Contractor Supplies
Business.

We sell a variety of contractor supplies, such as construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies, through several channels, including our sales representatives, rental branches and U.S. and Canadian product
catalogues. Although revenues from the contractor supplies business grew from $125 in 2002 to $378 in 2007, this business has required us to maintain significant volumes of inventory in order to meet customer demand and carries a higher cost
structure relative to our core equipment rental business. In 2007, the gross margin for our contractor supplies business was 19.0 percent as compared to 38.7 percent for equipment rentals.

We have refocused our contractor supplies business and positioned it more clearly as a complementary offering to our equipment rental business. We expect
this to result in productivity improvements within our sales force, thus helping to improve equipment utilization. As part of this initiative, we are reducing the number of stock keeping units associated with these operations, especially in lower
margin commodity categories. Additionally, we have recently closed three of our nine distribution centers and we intend to close an additional two distribution centers in the first half of 2008. We expect these changes will reduce our revenues
associated with contractor supplies, but improve our margins.

As discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and
elsewhere in this report, the Company is subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative suits, as well as the subject of an SEC inquiry. The U.S. Attorney’s office has also requested information from the Company about matters related to
the SEC inquiry. Although we have not accrued any amounts related to the ultimate disposition of these matters to date, any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations
and cash flows during the period incurred. Other costs associated with the SEC inquiry, the U.S. Attorney’s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits, including reimbursement of attorneys’ fees incurred by indemnified
officers and directors, are expensed as incurred.

Financial Overview

Income from continuing operations

. Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 were
as follows:

2007 income from continuing operations of $363, or $3.26 per diluted share, was a record for the
company and included an after-tax gain of $57, or $0.50 per diluted share, related to the recent termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of Cerberus (see other income below). Excluding the merger termination benefit, our income from
continuing operations of $306, which was also a record for the company, increased 22.9 percent from $249 for 2006. 2006 income from continuing operations of $249, or $2.28 per diluted share, increased 23.3 percent from $202 for 2005. For 2008, we
are forecasting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.80-$3.00.

Free Cash Flow GAAP Reconciliation

We define “free cash flow” as (i) net cash provided by operating activities less (ii) purchases of rental and
non-rental equipment plus (iii) proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment and excess tax benefits


from share-based payment arrangements. Management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet
future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Accordingly, free cash flow should
not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash
flow.

(1)

As discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”) on January 1, 2006.
FAS 123(R) requires that excess tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows prospectively from January 1, 2006. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123 (R), such excess tax benefits were presented as operating cash flows. There were no excess
tax benefits for 2006 and 2005 as we were in a net operating loss position for federal income tax purposes.

In 2007, we
reported revenues and free cash flow of $3.7 billion and $242, respectively. Our 2007 equipment rental revenue growth of 4.0 percent trailed our primary end market, private non-residential construction, which grew 16.7 percent in 2007 according to
Department of Commerce data (which has not been adjusted for inflation). The lag in growth rate between our equipment rental revenue and our primary end market primarily reflects a more targeted allocation of our growth capital, which we
deliberately did not increase to a level that would have kept pace on a nation-wide basis with industry demand. Our 2.5 percent overall revenue growth, which includes rental revenue growth of 4.0 percent, reflects a 2.5 percentage point improvement
in time utilization to 64.0 percent, partially offset by a 1.1 percent decline in rental rates. Free cash flow for 2007 includes $100 of cash we received following the termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of Cerberus Capital
Management, L.P. (“Cerberus”), less transaction related costs of $9; see other income below.

In 2006, we reported revenues and
free cash flow of $3.6 billion and $235, respectively. Our 2006 equipment rental revenue growth of 8.2 percent trailed our primary end market, private non-residential construction, which grew 16.2 percent in 2006 according to Department of Commerce
data. Our 10.7 percent revenue growth, which includes equipment rental growth of 8.2 percent, reflects increased rental rates of 5.1 percent, partially offset by a 0.3 percentage point decline in time utilization to 61.5 percent. In addition to
generating significant revenue and free cash flow growth in 2006, we reduced our total debt (including our subordinated convertible debentures) by $450.

Revenues for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 were as follows:


Equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment, as well as related revenues such as the
fees we charge for equipment delivery, fuel, repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers. Sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment. Contractor supplies sales include our sales of
supplies utilized by contractors, which include construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies. Services and other includes our repair services (including parts sales) as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop
and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations.

2007 total revenues of $3.7
billion increased 2.5 percent compared with total revenues of $3.6 billion in 2006. The increase primarily reflects a 4.0 percent increase in equipment rental revenue, partially offset by a 4.8 percent decline in used equipment sales. The increase
in equipment rental revenue reflects a 2.5 percentage point improvement in time utilization, partially offset by a 1.1 percent decline in rental rates. The decline in used equipment sales reflects volume declines and a shift in the mix of equipment
sold. The 1.8 percent decline in contractor supplies sales is consistent with the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007 to reposition our contractor supplies business. Looking forward, we expect contractor supplies and used equipment
sales to decline by approximately 40 percent and 35 percent, respectively, in 2008 as compared to 2007. These anticipated reductions are consistent with our refocus on the core rental business as well as our efforts to improve time utilization.

2006 total revenues of $3.6 billion increased 10.7 percent compared with total revenues of $3.3 billion in 2005. The increase primarily
reflects an 8.2 percent increase in equipment rentals and a 27.9 percent increase in contractor supplies sales. The increase in equipment rentals reflects a 5.1 percent increase in rental rates, partially offset by a 0.3 percentage point decline in
time utilization to 61.5 percent. The increase in contractor supplies sales reflects increased volume as we expanded our product offering.

Critical
Accounting Policies

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S GAAP. A summary of our significant
accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. In applying many accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are often subjective and may
change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations. We have identified below our accounting policies that
we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions, estimates and judgments. Although actual results may differ from those estimates, we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate.

Revenue Recognition

. We recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight-line basis. Our rental contract periods are daily,
weekly or monthly. By way of example, if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily, weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were (in actual dollars) $100, $300 and $900, respectively, we would recognize revenue of
$32.14 per day. The daily rate is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of $900 by 28 days, the monthly term. As part of this straight-line methodology, when the equipment is returned, we recognize as incremental revenue the excess, if any,
between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date. Revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the
customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts. These allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical
write-off experience. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our
allowance.


Useful Lives of Rental Equipment and Property and Equipment

. We depreciate rental equipment
and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives, after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to ten percent of cost. The useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the
asset will generate revenues, and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period. We may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other
changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets.

Purchase Price Allocation

. We have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and expect that we will continue to make acquisitions in the future. We allocate the cost of the acquired
enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. With the exception of goodwill, long-lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions. The
long-lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment, transportation equipment and real estate. With limited exceptions, virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been
classified as “To be Used,” rather than as “To be Sold.” Equipment that we acquire and classify as “To be Used” is recorded at fair value, as determined by replacement cost to the Company of such equipment. We use third
party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost.

In addition to long-lived fixed assets, we also acquire other assets and
assume liabilities. These other assets and liabilities typically include, but are not limited to, parts inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Because of their short-term nature, the fair values of these
other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities’ balance sheets. However, when appropriate, we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence. The intangible
assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill, customer relationships and covenants not-to-compete. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed. Customer relationships and non-compete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows.

Income Taxes

. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to
be reported in our income tax returns. These deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be
settled or realized. In the case of deferred tax assets, the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We generally evaluate projected taxable income over an appropriate period for each jurisdiction to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and, in addition,
examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss
carryforward amounts. This valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, which requires the use of a two-step approach for
recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we
presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.


We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly,
accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters. Our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our
effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results.

Reserves for Claims

. We are exposed to various claims relating
to our business, including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self-insured retentions, which we sometimes refer to as “self-insurance”. These claims include (i) workers
compensation claims and (ii) claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel. These types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and, accordingly, the ultimate liability associated
with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time. Our methodology for developing self-insurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party
actuaries. Our estimation process considers, among other matters, the cost of known claims over time, cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims. These estimates may change based on, among other things, changes in our claims history or
receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims. Further, these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts. Accordingly, we may be
required to increase or decrease our reserve levels.

Legal Contingencies

.

We are involved in a variety of claims,
lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, as described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is
deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling
our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable
outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the
period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.

Results of Operations

As discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety, pump and power. The
general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial, industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities. The general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers,
utilities, municipalities and homeowners. The general rentals segment operates throughout the United States and Canada and has one location in Mexico. The trench safety, pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products
and related services. The trench safety, pump and power segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment operates in the United States and has one
location in Canada.

These segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources. We evaluate
segment performance based on segment operating results.

We completed acquisitions in each of 2007, 2006, and 2005 which are discussed
further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. In view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions, we believe that our results for these periods are not fully directly comparable, although there
is no material impact from these acquisitions.


Revenues by segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 were as
follows:

Equipment rentals.

2007 equipment rentals of $2.63 billion increased $100, or 4.0 percent,
reflecting a 2.5 percentage point increase in time utilization on a larger fleet, partially offset by a 1.1 percent decline in rental rates and a shift in the mix of equipment on rent. Equipment rentals represented 70 percent of total revenues in
2007. On a segment basis, equipment rentals represented 70 percent and 79 percent of total revenue for general rentals and trench safety, pump and power, respectively. General rentals equipment rentals increased $93, or 3.9 percent, reflecting a 3.2
percent increase in same-store rental revenues. Trench safety, pump and power equipment rentals increased $7, or 4.1 percent, reflecting a 1.7 percent increase in same-store rental revenues, as well as increased revenues from cold starts.

2006 equipment rentals of $2.53 billion increased $192, or 8.2 percent, reflecting a 5.1 percent increase in rental rates and a 0.3
percentage point improvement in time utilization. General rentals equipment rentals increased $163, or 7.4 percent, reflecting increased rental rates and a 6.3 percent increase in same-store rental revenues. Trench safety, pump and power equipment
rentals increased $29, or 20.7 percent, reflecting a 5.0 percent increase in same-store rental revenues, as well as increased revenues from acquisitions and cold starts.

Sales of rental equipment

. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, sales of rental equipment have represented approximately 9 percent of our total revenues. Our general rentals
segment accounted for approximately 95 percent of these sales. 2007 sales of rental equipment of $319 declined $16, or 4.8 percent, from 2006 reflecting price and volume declines as well as a shift in the mix of equipment sold. 2006 sales of rental
equipment of $335 increased $31, or 10.2 percent, as compared to 2005 reflecting price increases and a shift in the mix of equipment sold.

Sales of new equipment

. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, sales of new equipment represented approximately 6 percent of our total revenue. Our general rentals segment accounted for approximately
94 percent of these sales. 2007 sales of new equipment of $230 declined $2, or 0.9 percent, from


2006 reflecting volume declines, partially offset by price increases. 2006 sales of new equipment of $232 increased $27, or 13.2 percent, as compared to 2005
reflecting price increases and a shift in the mix of equipment sold.

Sales of contractor supplies

. For each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2007, sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 10 percent of our total revenue. Our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 96 percent of these sales. 2007 sales of contractor supplies of
$378 declined $7, or 1.8 percent, from 2006 reflecting the initial effect of repositioning this business. 2006 sales of contractor supplies of $385 increased $84, or 27.9 percent, as compared to 2005 reflecting an increase in the volume of supplies
sold.

Service and other revenues

. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, service and other
revenues represented approximately 5 percent of our total revenue. Our general rentals segment accounted for approximately 98 percent of these sales. 2007 service and other revenues of $174 increased $16, or 10.1 percent, from 2006 reflecting
increased volume.

Discontinued Operation.

In December 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our traffic
control business to HTS Acquisition, Inc., an entity formed by affiliates of private equity investors Wynnchurch Capital Partners and Oak Hill Special Opportunities Fund L.P. In connection with this transaction, we recorded an after-tax loss on sale
in 2006 of $24. The transaction closed in February 2007 and we received net proceeds of $66. The loss on sale, as well as the results of operations of our traffic control business, have been reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated
statements of income.

Fourth Quarter 2007 Items.

During the fourth quarter, we reduced our reserve for obsolescence and
shrinkage by $4 following our annual physical inventory inspections. This benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we recognized a benefit of $3 reflecting recent experience
related to our estimated provision for self-insurance reserves. This benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation. In addition to these matters, during the fourth quarter we recognized income of $94 (pre-tax) related to
the termination of our merger agreement with Cerberus as well as net foreign currency transaction gains of $17 (pre-tax). Both of these matters are discussed further below; see other income.

Fourth Quarter 2006 Items.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded a charge of $9 reflecting recent loss experience related to our
estimated provision for self-insurance reserves. Of this amount, $7 was recorded in cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation, and the balance was recorded in discontinued operations as it related to our traffic control business. Also,
during the fourth quarter of 2006, we reduced our reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage by $10 following our annual physical inventory inspections. Of this amount, $7 was recorded in cost of contractor supplies sales and $3 was recorded
in cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation. In addition to these matters, we recorded a charge of $7 related to our estimated exposure for sales-tax matters. This amount has been reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in
the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

Segment Operating Profit

. Segment operating profit and operating margin
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 were as follows:


General rentals.

For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, general
rentals accounted for 91 percent of our total operating profit. This contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ revenue contribution over the same period. General rentals’ operating margin in 2007 increased 0.6 percentage
points from 2006, primarily resulting from the realization of the initial benefits of cost-saving initiatives implemented in 2007. General rentals’ operating margin in 2006 increased 1.3 percentage points from 2005, as the benefits of higher
rental rates were partially offset by increased costs for labor and benefits as well as reduced gross margins on contractor supplies.

Trench safety, pump and power

. Operating profit in 2007 declined $1, reflecting slight declines in gross profit on new equipment sales and contractor supplies, partially offset by an increase in gross profit on sales of rental
equipment. Operating profit in 2006 increased $11, reflecting a $37 increase in revenues principally related to acquisitions and cold starts.

Gross Margin

. We have historically realized higher gross margins on sales of rental equipment than on sales of new equipment. This is consistent with the marketplace in general and not unique to United Rentals. Gross margins
by revenue classification were as follows:

2007 gross margin of 35.1 percent declined 0.3 percentage points from 2006, reflecting a 0.2
percentage point decline in gross margin on equipment rentals, a 3.0 percentage point decline in gross margin on sales of rental equipment and a 2.6 percentage point decline in gross margin on contractor supplies, partially offset by a 2.7
percentage point improvement in gross margin on service and other revenues. The decline in equipment rental gross margin reflects increased rental costs and a 1.1 percent decline in rental rates, partially offset by a 2.5 percentage point
improvement in time utilization. The decline in gross margins on sales of rental equipment and contractor supplies reflects pricing pressure as well as a shift in the mix of product sold. The increase in margin on service and other revenues reflects
increased revenue.

2006 gross margin of 35.4 percent increased 1.5 percentage points from 2005, reflecting a 2.2 percentage point increase
in equipment rentals gross margin and a 2.7 percentage point increase in the sales of rental equipment gross margin, partially offset by a 1.7 percentage point reduction in gross margin on contractor supplies. The improved equipment rental margin
reflected a 5.1 percent increase in rental rates, partially offset by a 0.3 percentage point decline in time utilization to 61.5 percent. The improved margin on sales of rental equipment reflects improved pricing and a shift in the mix of equipment
sold. The reduction in contractor supplies sales gross margin reflects increased costs related to our distribution centers.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses (SG&A)

. SG&A expense information for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 was as follows:

SG&A expense primarily includes sales force compensation, information technology costs, third
party professional fees, advertising and marketing expenses, management salaries, bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead.


2007 SG&A expense of $595 declined $18, or 2.9 percent, as compared to 2006 and declined by 0.9
percentage points as a percentage of revenue. This decline reflects a $13 reduction in professional fees related to regulatory matters, the initial benefits of our cost-saving initiatives, reduced incentive compensation costs and a $3 reduction in
bad debt expense. The benefit associated with these matters was partially offset by severance costs associated with headcount reductions completed in the second half of 2007, the amendment of our former Chairman’s service agreement, charges
associated with the accelerated vesting, upon his June 4, 2007 retirement, of a restricted stock award held by our former Chief Executive Officer, as well as normal inflationary increases.

2006 SG&A expense of $613 increased 10.8 percent as compared to 2005 and was flat as a percentage of revenue. The increase in actual SG&A costs
reflects normal inflationary increases, higher selling and insurance costs related to growth in the business and increased professional fees for business improvement initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a year-over-year reduction of
$5 in the level of professional fees related to regulatory matters as well as reduced bad debt expense.

Non-rental depreciation and
amortization

for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 was as follows:

Year Ended December 31,




Non-rental depreciation and amortization

$


$


$


Non-rental depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation expense associated with
equipment that is not offered for rent (such as computers and office equipment) and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements as well as (ii) the amortization of other intangible assets. Our other intangible assets consist of
non-compete agreements as well as customer-related intangible assets. The increases in 2007 and 2006 relate to a higher basis of depreciable assets. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2006, we determined that we had been depreciating certain
vehicles on capital lease over a period which exceeded the related contractual lease terms. As a result, our non-rental depreciation and amortization expense for 2006 includes a charge of $4 to correct depreciation expense recorded since the fourth
quarter of 2002.

Interest expense, net

for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 was as
follows:

Year Ended December 31,




Interest expense, net

$


$


$


Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $21 or 10.1 percent as
compared to 2006, reflecting lower average debt balances and the $9 benefit we recognized related to the mark-to-market impact of certain interest rate swaps. The decrease also reflects the absence of the charge we incurred in 2006 related to our
term loan prepayment and the retirement of subordinated convertible debentures. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $27, or 14.9 percent, as compared to 2005, reflecting the increase in interest rates applicable
to our floating rate debt, partially offset by lower average debt balances. The 2006 increase also reflects a net charge of $6 that we recorded related to our $400 term loan prepayment as well as the retirement of $76 of subordinated convertible
debentures. The net charge of $6 includes non-cash write-offs of $9 associated with deferred financing costs, partially offset by a gain of $3 recognized in conjunction with the termination of certain interest rate caps. The term loan prepayment and
retirement of subordinated convertible debentures are discussed further below; see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 65 and 53 percent of our total debt was floating rate debt, respectively. As discussed further below (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”), in January 2008, we terminated interest rate swap
agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $1.2 billion. Had these swaps been terminated as of December 31, 2007, approximately 18 percent of our total debt would have been floating rate debt.


Interest expense- subordinated convertible debentures

for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2007 was as follows:

Year Ended December 31,




Interest expense- subordinated convertible debentures

$

$


As discussed further in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, the subordinated
convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary that has issued preferred securities. This subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary
beneficiary of the trust. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was $146. The decline in interest expense- subordinated convertible debentures from 2006 to 2007 reflects the
retirement of $76 of these subordinated convertible debentures in the second half of 2006.

Other Income

. In April 2007, we
announced that our board of directors had authorized the commencement of a process to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including a possible sale of the Company. In July 2007, we announced that we
had signed a merger agreement to be acquired by Cerberus. In December 2007, following the termination of that merger agreement, we received a break-up fee of $100. Other income for 2007 includes the income associated with the receipt of the break-up
fee, net of related transaction costs of $9.

Other income for 2007 also includes $17 of net foreign currency transaction gains relating to
intercompany transactions primarily between our Canadian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Canadian dollar, and our U.S subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Because these intercompany transactions do not hedge a
foreign currency commitment and have been determined not to be of a long-term investment nature, exchange rate movements between the Canadian and U.S. dollars are required to be included in income during the period in which exchange rates change.
Prior to 2007, we had been reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on these intercompany transactions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity, rather than including them in income. Our results
for 2007 include the cumulative impact of correcting for this matter. Of the $17 recognized in 2007, $13 relates to 2007 exchange rate movements and $4 relates to prior periods. This correction does not affect historical or future cash flows and its
effect on our current and prior years’ net income, cash flows from operations, and stockholders’ equity is not material.

statutory income tax rate of 35.0 percent for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, relate primarily to state taxes and certain nondeductible charges and other items. Additionally, 2007 includes a benefit associated with the release of state tax
valuation allowances, partially offset by certain non-deductible compensation expense and prior year state tax matters. Our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events (such as audit settlements) as well as other factors,
including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a
full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Liquidity

. We manage our liquidity using internal
cash management practices, which are subject to (i) the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services, (ii) the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we
are a party and (iii) the statutes, regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate.

Our principal
existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility. As of December 31, 2007, we had
(i) $510 of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facility, (ii) $300 of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and (iii) cash
and cash equivalents of $381. Cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 consist of high quality, low risk Treasury securities and do not include any auction rate securities. We believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support
our existing operations over the next twelve months.

We expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over
the next twelve months will be to fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale, (iii) payments due under operating leases and (iv) debt service. We
plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash. In addition, we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment or real estate or through the use of additional operating leases. Additionally,
if we were to pursue an acquisition, recapitalization or other strategy to enhance shareholder value, our existing levels of indebtedness may increase and, as a result, a greater portion of our cash may be required to service any such indebtedness.
For information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases, see “Certain Information Concerning Contractual Obligations.”

The amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and growth
prospects. We estimate that our capital expenditures for 2008 will be approximately $715, which represents a decrease of $275 as compared to 2007. We expect that we will fund such expenditures from proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental
equipment, cash generated from operations and, if required, borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility.

Term Loan Prepayment:

In the third quarter of 2006, we prepaid $400 of our outstanding term loan using $200 of available cash and $200 borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility.
Contemporaneous with this term loan prepayment, we terminated a portion of our interest rate caps that were hedging our interest rate exposures on our term loan. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we subsequently repaid $175 of the $200 previously
borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility.

Retirement of
Subordinated Convertible Debentures:

As previously discussed, the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has issued 6


/2 percent Convertible Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (“QUIPS”). In 2006, we announced the redemption of $76 of QUIPS. The redemption price was 101.3 percent.
In conjunction with the redemption, we retired $76 of our subordinated convertible debentures. This redemption was funded with proceeds from stock option exercises received during 2006.


Accounts Receivable Securitization:

In October 2006, we amended our existing accounts receivable
securitization facility. The amended facility provides for generally lower borrowing costs and the facility size has been increased from $200 to $300. Additionally, the maturity date has been extended from May 2009 to October 2011. Borrowings under
the amended facility will continue to be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets.

Loan Covenants and Compliance.

As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our senior secured credit facility, the senior notes, the QUIPS and our accounts receivables securitization facility. Any failure to be in
compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.

We consider our most restrictive covenant to be the Minimum Interest Coverage ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated net income to our interest expense, as defined in our senior secured credit facility. The minimum amount permitted
under this covenant is 1.65 to 1.0 and our actual Minimum Interest Coverage ratio for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 3.47 to 1.0.

Sources and Uses of Cash—Continuing Operations

. During 2007, we (i) generated cash from operations of $859 (including the $100 termination fee we received from Cerberus, less transaction related costs of $9) and
(ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $342. We used cash during this period principally to (i) purchase rental and non-rental equipment of $990 and (ii) fund payments on debt, net of proceeds
received, of $71. Additionally, during 2007, we received net proceeds of $66 related to the sale of our traffic control business. During 2006, we (i) generated cash from operations of $834, (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and
non-rental equipment of $352 and (iii) received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $78. We used cash during this period principally to (i) purchase rental and non-rental equipment of $951, (ii) fund payments on debt, net
of proceeds received, of $404 and (iv) retire $76 of subordinated convertible debentures. During 2005, we (i) generated cash from operations of $638 and (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $315. We
used cash during this period principally to (i) purchase rental and non-rental equipment of $801, (ii) fund debt repayments and financing costs of $74 and (iii) purchase other companies, net of cash acquired, of $40.

Our credit ratings as of February 15, 2008 were as follows:

Corporate Rating

Outlook

Moody’s

B1

Stable

S&P

BB-

Stable

Fitch

BB-

Stable

Both our ability to obtain financing and the related cost of borrowing are affected by our credit
ratings, which are periodically reviewed by these rating agencies. Our current credit ratings are below investment grade and we expect our access to the public debt markets to be limited to the non-investment grade segment as long as our ratings
reflect a below investment grade rating.


Certain Information Concerning Contractual Obligations

. The table below provides certain
information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007:

(1)

The payments due with respect to a period represent (i) in the case of debt and capital leases, the scheduled principal payments due in such period, and (ii) in the case
of operating leases, the minimum lease payments due in such period under non-cancelable operating leases.

(2)

Estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2007.

(3)

As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding purchase orders with our equipment and inventory suppliers. These purchase orders, which were negotiated in the ordinary course
of business, aggregate approximately $111. These purchase commitments can be cancelled by us, generally with 30 days notice and without cancellation penalties. The equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers for these purchases and
related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout 2008.

(4)

Includes interest payments.

(5)

This information excludes $7 of unrecognized tax benefits which are discussed further in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. It is not possible to estimate the time
period during which these amounts may be paid to tax authorities.

Certain Information Concerning Restricted
Stock

. We have granted to employees other than executive officers and directors approximately 39,000 shares of restricted stock that have not yet vested. The shares vest in 2008 and are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting upon certain
terminations of employment, the violation of non-compete provisions and certain other events. If a holder of restricted stock sells his or her stock and receives sales proceeds that are less than a specified guaranteed amount set forth in the grant
instrument, we have agreed to pay the holder the shortfall between the amount received and such specified amount; however, the foregoing only applies to sales that are made within five trading days of the vesting date. The specified guaranteed
amount is $19.86 per share.

Relationship Between Holdings and URNA.

Holdings is principally a holding company and
primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, URNA, and subsidiaries of URNA. Holdings provides certain services to URNA in connection with its operations. These services principally include: (i) senior management
services, (ii) finance and tax related services and support, (iii) information technology systems and support, (iv) acquisition related services, (v) legal services and (vi) human resource support. In addition, Holdings
leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by URNA and its subsidiaries.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk primarily consists of (i) interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and (ii) foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our Canadian operations.


Interest Rate Risk.

During 2007 and
earlier periods, we utilized interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional
amount of $1.2 billion. The effect of the swap agreements were, at December 31, 2007, to convert $1.2 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments. The fixed rate notes being converted consisted of (i) $445 of our


/2 percent Notes through 2012, (ii) $375 of our 7 percent Notes through 2014, and (iii) $375 of our 7


/4 percent senior subordinated notes through 2013.

As of December 31, 2007, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, we had an aggregate of $1.7 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. As of December 31, 2007, the debt that was subject to
fluctuations in interest rates included $140 of borrowings under our Canadian revolving facility, $1.2 billion in swaps and $327 of term loans. The interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on December 31, 2007 were (i) 6.5
percent for the revolving credit facility (which represents the Canadian rate, since the amount outstanding was Canadian borrowings), (ii) 7.6 percent for the debt subject to our swap agreements and (iii) 7.1 percent for the term loan. As
of December 31, 2007, based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, our annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $10 for each one percentage point
increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt.

The amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate
significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility. Additionally, in January 2008 we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements and made
a payment of $4. Had these swaps been terminated as of December 31, 2007, we would have had an aggregate of $467 of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. For additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt,
see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

Currency Exchange Risk

.

The functional currency for our
Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. As a result, our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. Based upon the level of our Canadian operations during 2007 relative to the
company as a whole, a 10 percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings. We had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2007. We do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts
for speculative purposes.


Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

United Rentals, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Rentals, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Rentals, Inc. at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” effective
January 1, 2007 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” using the modified-prospective transition method, effective January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), United Rentals, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share data and unless
otherwise indicated)

1.    Organization, Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

United Rentals, Inc. (“Holdings,” “United Rentals” or the “Company”) is principally a holding company and conducts its
operations primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, United Rentals (North America), Inc. (“URNA”), and subsidiaries of URNA. Holdings’ primary asset is its sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
URNA. URNA’s various credit agreements and debt instruments place restrictions on its ability to transfer funds to its shareholder.

We rent equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and others in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition to renting equipment, we
sell new and used rental equipment, as well as related contractor supplies, parts and service.

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include our accounts and those of our controlled subsidiary companies. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We consolidate variable interest entities if we are deemed the primary beneficiary of the
entity. Certain reclassifications of prior years’ amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents at
December 31, 2007 consist of high quality, low risk Treasury securities.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect.

Inventory

Inventory consists of new
equipment, contractor supplies, tools, parts, fuel and related supply items. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined, depending on the type of inventory, on either a specific identification, weighted average or
first-in, first-out method.

Rental Equipment

Rental equipment, which includes service and delivery vehicles, is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the equipment using the straight-line method. The range of estimated useful lives for rental equipment is
two to ten years. Rental equipment is depreciated to a salvage value of zero to ten percent of cost. Costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining
useful life of the related equipment. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Repair and maintenance costs are included in cost of revenues on our consolidated statements of income. Repair and maintenance expense
(including both labor and parts) for our rental equipment was $324, $302 and $271, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The range of estimated useful lives for property and equipment is two to thirty-nine years.
Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or the remaining life of the lease, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over
the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. We test for goodwill impairment at a regional level. We are required to review our goodwill for impairment annually as of a scheduled review date, however, if events or circumstances
suggest that goodwill could be impaired, we may be required to conduct an earlier review. The scheduled review date is October 1 of each year.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements and customer relationships. The
non-compete agreements are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 1 to 10 years. The customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 5 to 12 years.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are recorded at
the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As part of an ongoing review of the valuation of long-lived assets, we assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired. If this review indicates the carrying
value of these assets may not be recoverable, as determined by an undiscounted cash flow analysis over the remaining useful life, the carrying value would be reduced to its estimated fair value.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Under SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” all derivatives are required to be recorded as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of
derivatives are recognized immediately or deferred, depending on the use of the derivative and whether or not it qualifies as a hedge. We periodically use derivative financial instruments in the management of our interest rate and foreign currency
exposures. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.

Translation of Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States which have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated
into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the year. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates effective during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets for accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities
approximate fair value due to the immediate to short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of the revolving credit facility and term loan are determined using current interest rates for similar instruments as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006 and approximate the carrying value of these financial instruments due to the fact that the underlying instruments include provisions to adjust interest rates to approximate fair market value. The estimated fair value
of our other financial instruments at December 31, 2007 and 2006 have been calculated based upon available market information and are as follows:

Revenue Recognition

Our rental contract periods are daily, weekly or monthly and we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight-line basis. As part of this straight-line methodology, when the equipment is returned, we recognize as
incremental revenue the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date. Revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the
time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ratified the consensus reached on EITF Issue No. 06-03, “How Sales
Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)” (“EITF 06-03”). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes
on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06-03 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007. Sales tax amounts collected from customers have been recorded on a net basis. The
adoption of EITF 06-03 did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Advertising Expense

We promote our business through local and national advertising in various media, including trade publications, yellow pages, the Internet, radio and
direct mail. Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred.

Insurance

We are insured for general liability, workers’ compensation, and automobile liability, subject to deductibles, or self-insured retentions, per
occurrence of $2 for general liability, $1 for workers’ compensation and $2 for automobile liability as of December 31, 2007. Losses within these deductible amounts are accrued based upon the aggregate liability for reported claims
incurred, as well as an estimated liability for claims incurred but not yet reported. These liabilities are not discounted. The company is also self-insured for group medical claims but purchases “stop loss” insurance to protect itself
from any one loss exceeding $330,000 (actual dollars).


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

Income Taxes

We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely
than not realized in future periods.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax
positions. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of
the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The second
step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that
is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an
increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset, or an increase in a deferred tax liability.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates include goodwill impairment charges, allowance for doubtful
accounts, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, reserves for claims, loss contingencies and fair values of financial instruments. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments
that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Concentration of credit risk with
respect to accounts receivable is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up our customer base. Our largest customer accounted for less than 1 percent of total revenues in each of 2007, 2006, and 2005 and no single
customer represented greater than 1 percent of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2007 and 2006. We control credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and other monitoring procedures.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1,
2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”), which establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. FAS 123(R) provides that stock-based compensation costs be measured
at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates
and expected option life. We


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified-prospective transition method and therefore we did not restate the results of prior periods. The adoption of FAS 123(R)
did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FAS 123(R) requires that cash flows from tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for stock-based awards (“excess tax benefits”) be
classified as financing cash flows prospectively from January 1, 2006. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), any excess tax benefits were to be presented as operating cash flows.

Restricted stock awards are valued based on the fair value of the stock on the grant date. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), unearned compensation for
grants of restricted stock equivalent to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant was recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized to compensation expense over the awards’ vesting period. In
accordance with FAS 123(R), stockholders’ equity is credited commensurate with the recognition of compensation expense. All unamortized unearned compensation at January 1, 2006 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.

Prior to January 1, 2006, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” we did not recognize compensation expense relating to employee stock options because the exercise price was equal to or greater than the fair market value (as defined under the relevant award plan) of our stock at the date of grant.
If we had elected to recognize compensation expense using a fair value approach, our pro forma income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been as follows:

The weighted average fair value of options granted was $8.18 during 2005. The fair value was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which uses subjective assumptions which can materially affect fair value estimates and, therefore, does not necessarily provide a single measure of fair value of options. In
2005, we used a risk-free interest rate average of 3.9, a volatility factor for the market price of our common stock of 60 percent, and a weighted-average expected life of options of approximately three years. For purposes of these pro forma
disclosures, the estimated fair value of options is amortized over the options’ vesting period.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“Statement 141 (R)”), a replacement of FASB Statement
No. 141. Statement 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and applies to all business combinations. Statement 141(R) provides that, upon initially obtaining control, an acquirer shall recognize 100
percent of the fair values of acquired assets, including goodwill, and assumed liabilities, with only limited exceptions, even if the acquirer has not acquired 100 percent


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

of its target. As a consequence, the current step acquisition model will be eliminated. Additionally, Statement 141(R) changes current practice, in part, as
follows: (1) contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration; (2) transaction costs will be expensed as incurred, rather than capitalized as
part of the purchase price; (3) pre-acquisition contingencies, such as legal issues, will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value; and (4) in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting,
the requirements in FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

, would have to be met at the acquisition date. While there is no expected impact to our consolidated financial statements on the
accounting for acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008, the adoption of Statement 141(R) on January 1, 2009 could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to that date.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 157,

Fair Value Measurement

(“Statement 157”). Statement 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value. Statement 157 also expands financial
statement disclosures about fair value measurements. On February 6, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157-b which delays the effective date of Statement 157 for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Statement 157 and FSP 157-b are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. We have elected a partial deferral of Statement 157 under the provisions of FSP 157-b related to the measurement of fair value used when evaluating goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets for
impairment and valuing asset retirement obligations and liabilities for exit or disposal activities. The impact of partially adopting Statement 157 effective January 1, 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities—Including an Amendment of SFAS 115

(“Statement 159”), which permits but does not require us to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. As we have not elected to fair value any of our financial instruments
under the provisions of Statement 159, the adoption of this statement will not have any impact to our consolidated financial statements.

3.    Discontinued Operation

In December 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our
traffic control business to HTS Acquisition, Inc. (“HTS”), an entity formed by affiliates of private equity investors Wynnchurch Capital Partners and Oak Hill Special Opportunities Fund, L.P. In connection with this transaction, we
recorded an after-tax loss on sale in 2006 of $24. The transaction closed in February 2007 and we received net proceeds of $66.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the results of operations of our traffic control business have been reported within discontinued operations in the consolidated statements
of income, and prior period consolidated statements of income were recast. The assets and liabilities associated with the traffic control business have also been classified separately in our consolidated balance sheets. General corporate overhead
costs previously allocated to traffic control have been reclassified and reflected in continuing operations.

Summarized results of operations for traffic control are as follows:

The following is a summary of the assets and liabilities of traffic control as of
December 31, 2006:

In conjunction with the sale, we retained financial responsibility for deductibles and
self-insured retentions associated with casualty insurance programs (workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability) covering the traffic control business with respect to claims arising from loss occurrences prior to closing.
These liabilities were not assumed by the purchaser. We are not liable for these types of liabilities associated with the traffic control business which arise subsequent to the sale. The aggregate amount of these retained liabilities as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $22 and $30, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

4.    Segment Information

The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies in note 2. Certain corporate costs, including those related to selling, finance, legal, risk management, human resources, corporate management and information technology systems, are deemed to be of an operating nature and are
allocated to our segments based on the actual amount of costs incurred in the prior year for selling, general and administrative expenses or equipment rental revenue generating activities. As discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial
statements, traffic control, which was previously presented as a reporting segment, is now presented as a discontinued operation.

The
following table sets forth financial information by segment. Information related to our consolidated balance sheets is presented as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

7.    Acquisitions

We completed one, two and two acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The results of operations of the
businesses acquired in these acquisitions have been included in our results of operations from their respective acquisition dates.

In
February 2007, we acquired High Reach Equipment Services, LLC (“High Reach”). High Reach had one aerial equipment branch in Georgia and 2006 revenues of approximately $11. The aggregate purchase price for this acquisition was approximately
$22.

In March 2006, we acquired the equipment and assets of Handy Rent-All Center, which had annual revenues of approximately $16. The
aggregate purchase price for this acquisition was approximately $23. In June 2006, we acquired the equipment and assets of D. Larry Carter, Inc., which had annual revenues of approximately $10. The aggregate purchase price for this acquisition was
approximately $18.

In December 2005, we acquired Sandvick Equipment & Supply Company, a trench safety company, with annual
revenues of approximately $21. In June 2005, we acquired HSS RentX branch locations in Colorado. Total 2004 revenues of the acquired branches were approximately $9. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $42, less
liabilities assumed of approximately $10.

The purchase prices for all acquisitions have been allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at their respective acquisition dates. Purchase price allocations are subject to change when additional information concerning asset and liability valuations is completed. The preliminary
purchase price allocations that are subject to change primarily consist of intangible assets as well as rental and non-rental equipment valuations. These allocations are finalized within twelve months of the acquisition date and are not expected to
result in significant differences between the preliminary and final allocations.

Pro forma combined results of operations giving effect to
these acquisitions would not vary materially from historical results.

Other long-term liabilities consist of the following:

10.    Debt

Debt consists of the following:

Senior Secured Credit Facility

. URNA’s senior secured credit
facility, as amended and restated, includes a (i) $650 revolving credit facility, (ii) $150 institutional letter of credit facility and (iii) $750 term loan. The revolving credit facility, institutional letter of credit facility and
term loan are governed by the same credit agreement. URNA’s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to limited exceptions, URNA’s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of
the assets of URNA, Holdings and URNA’s domestic subsidiaries. Set forth below is certain additional information concerning the amended and restated facility.

Revolving Credit Facility

. The revolving credit facility enables URNA to borrow up to $650 on a revolving basis and enables
certain of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries to borrow up to $150 (provided that the aggregate borrowings of URI and the Canadian subsidiaries may not exceed $650). A portion of the revolving credit facility, up to $250, is available for
issuance of letters of credit. The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature and terminate in February 2009. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding borrowings under this facility were $140 and utilized letters of credit were $0. All
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007 were Canadian subsidiary borrowings.

U.S. dollar borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the borrower’s option, at either (a) the ABR rate (which is equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5 percent


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

and (ii) JPMorgan Chase Bank’s prime rate) plus a margin of 1.25 percent, or (b) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a maximum margin of 2.25 percent.

Canadian dollar borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the borrower’s option, at either
(a) the Canadian prime rate (which is equal to the greater of (i) the CDOR rate plus 1 percent and (ii) JPMorgan Chase Bank, Toronto Branch’s prime rate) plus a margin of 1.25 percent, or (b) the B/A rate (which is equal to
JPMorgan Chase Bank, Toronto Branch’s B/A rate) plus a maximum margin of 2.25 percent. The rate applicable to Canadian borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility was 6.5 at December 31, 2007.

URNA is also required to pay the lenders a commitment fee equal to 0.5 percent per annum, payable quarterly, in respect of undrawn
commitments under the revolving credit facility.

Institutional Letter of Credit Facility
(“ILCF”)

. The ILCF provides for up to $150 in letters of credit. The ILCF is in addition to the letter of credit capacity under the revolving credit facility. The total combined letter of credit capacity under the revolving credit
facility and the ILCF is $400. Subject to certain conditions, all or part of the ILCF may be converted into term loans. The ILCF is scheduled to terminate in February 2011. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding letters of credit under the
ILCF were approximately $137.

URNA is required to pay a fee which accrues at the rate of 0.1 percent per annum on the
amount of the ILCF. In addition, URI is required to pay participation and other fees in respect of letters of credit. For letters of credit obtained under both the ILCF and the revolving credit facility, these fees accrue at the rate of 2.40 percent
and 1.90 percent per annum, respectively.

Term Loan

. The term loan was obtained in two draws. An initial draw
of $550 was made upon the closing of the credit facility in February 2004 and an additional draw of $200 was made in April 2004.

The term loan must be repaid in installments as follows: (i) during the period from and including June 30, 2004 to and including March 31, 2010, URNA must repay on each March 31, June 30,
September 30 and December 31 of each year an amount equal to one-fourth of 1 percent of the original aggregate principal amount of the term loan reduced pro-rata by the $400 prepayment referred to below and (ii) URNA must repay on
each of June 30, 2010, September 30, 2010, December 31, 2010, and at maturity on February 14, 2011 an amount equal to 23.5 percent of the original aggregate principal amount of the term loan reduced pro-rata by the $400
prepayment referred to below. In 2006, we prepaid $400 of our outstanding term loan. Contemporaneous with this term loan prepayment, we terminated a portion of our interest rate caps that were hedging our interest rate exposures on our term loan.
Amounts repaid in respect of the term loan may not be reborrowed.

Borrowings under the term loan accrue interest, at
URNA’s option, at either (a) the ABR rate plus a maximum margin of 1.25 percent, or (b) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a maximum margin of 2.25 percent. The rate was 7.1 percent at December 31, 2007.

Covenants

. Under the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility, we are required to, among other things, satisfy
certain financial tests relating to: (a) interest coverage ratio, (b) the ratio of funded debt to cash flow, (c) the ratio of senior secured debt to tangible assets and (d) the ratio of senior secured debt to cash flow. We are
also subject to various other covenants under the agreement governing the credit facility. These covenants require us to timely file audited annual and quarterly financial statements and limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to incur
indebtedness, make prepayments of certain indebtedness, pay dividends, make investments, create liens, and engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. If we are unable to satisfy any of these covenants, the lenders


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

could elect to terminate the credit facility and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. If at any time an event of default
under the senior secured credit facility exists, the interest rate applicable to each revolving and term loan will be based on the highest margins provided for.

percent Senior Subordinated Notes.

In November 2003, URNA issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of 7


/


percent Senior Subordinated Notes (the “7


/

/


percent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to limited exceptions, URNA’s domestic subsidiaries. The 7


/


percent Notes may be redeemed on or after November 15, 2008, at specified redemption prices that range from 103.875 percent in 2008 to 100.0 percent in 2011 and thereafter. The
indenture governing the 7

(i) additional indebtedness, (ii) restricted payments, (iii) liens, (iv) dividends and other payments, (v) preferred stock of certain subsidiaries, (vi) transactions with affiliates, (vii) the disposition of
proceeds of asset sales and (viii) our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC.

7 percent Senior Subordinated Notes

.

In January 2004,
URI issued $375 aggregate principal amount of 7 percent Senior Subordinated Notes (the “7 percent Notes”) which are due February 15, 2014. The net proceeds from the sale of the 7 percent Notes were approximately $369, after deducting
offering expenses. The 7 percent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to limited exceptions, URNA’s domestic subsidiaries. The 7 percent Notes mature on February 15, 2014 and may be redeemed by URNA on or after
February 15, 2009, at specified redemption prices that range from 103.5 percent in 2009 to 100.0 percent in 2012 and thereafter. The indenture governing the 7 percent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others,
limitations on (i) additional indebtedness, (ii) restricted payments, (iii) liens, (iv) dividends and other payments, (v) preferred stock of certain subsidiaries, (vi) transactions with affiliates, (vii) the
disposition of proceeds of asset sales and (viii) our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC.

percent Notes were approximately
$985, after deducting offering expenses. The 6


/


percent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to
limited exceptions, URNA’s domestic subsidiaries. The 6

(iv) dividends and other payments, (v) preferred stock of certain subsidiaries, (vi) transactions with affiliates, (vii) the disposition of proceeds of asset sales, (viii) our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or
substantially all of our assets and (ix) sale-leaseback transactions, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC.

. In October and December 2003, URNA issued approximately $144 million aggregate principal
amount of 1


/


percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes (the “1


/


percent Convertible Notes”) which are due October 15, 2023. The net proceeds from the sale of the 1

guaranteed by Holdings. Holders of the 1

percent Convertible Notes may convert them into shares of common stock prior to their maturity at a current conversion price of approximately $22.25 per share (subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances), if (i) the price
of our common stock reaches a specific threshold, (ii) the 1


/


percent Convertible Notes are called for redemption,
(iii) specified corporate transactions occur or (iv) the trading price of the 1


/


percent Convertible Notes falls
below certain thresholds. The 1


/


percent Convertible Notes mature on October 15, 2023 and may be redeemed on or after
October 20, 2010, at 100.0 percent of the principal amount. Holders of the 1


/

to repurchase all or a portion of the 1


/


percent Convertible Notes in cash on each of October 15,
2010, October 15, 2013 and October 15, 2018 at 100 percent of the principal amount of the 1


/


percent
Convertible Notes to be repurchased.

Accounts Receivable Securitization
Facility

. In October 2006, we amended our existing accounts receivable securitization facility. The amended facility provides for generally lower borrowing costs and the facility size has been increased from $200 to $300. Additionally, the
maturity was extended from May 2009 to October 2011. Borrowings under the amended facility will continue to be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Key terms of this facility include:

•

borrowings may be made only to the extent that the face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool exceeds the outstanding loans by a specified amount;

•

the facility is structured so that the receivables in the collateral pool are the lenders’ only source of repayment;

•

after expiration or early termination of the facility, no new amounts will be advanced under the facility and collections on the receivables securing the facility
will be used to repay the outstanding borrowings; and

•

the facility contains standard termination events including, without limitation, a termination event if (i) the long-term senior secured rating of URI falls
below either B+ from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) or B2 from Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) or (ii) our New Credit Facility is terminated. At December 31, 2007, the
Company’s long-term senior secured debt was rated BB+ by S&P and Ba1 by Moody’s.

Outstanding borrowings
under the facility generally accrue interest at the commercial paper rate plus a specified spread not to exceed 1.0 percent. We are also required to pay a commitment fee based on our Funded Debt to Cash Flow ratio. This commitment fee was 22.5 basis
points (0.225 percent) at December 31, 2007.

Loan Covenants and Compliance

As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our senior secured credit facility, the senior notes, the
QUIPS and our accounts receivable securitization facility. Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.

We consider our most restrictive covenant to be the Minimum Interest Coverage ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated net income to our interest
expense, as defined in our senior secured credit facility. The minimum amount permitted under this covenant is 1.65 to 1.0 and our actual Minimum Interest Coverage ratio for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 3.47 to 1.0.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements.

As of
December 31, 2007, we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $1.2 billion. The effect of these agreements was to convert $1.2 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments. The fixed rate notes being converted
consisted of: (i) $445 of our 6


/2 percent Notes through 2012, (ii) $375 of our 7


/4 percent senior subordinated notes through 2013 and (iii) $375 of our 7 percent Notes through 2014. These swap agreements, which convert our fixed rate notes to floating
rate instruments, were initially designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2007, we had an unrealized loss of $12, based upon the fair value of our fair value hedges. In February 2007, swaps with a notional of $250 were modified and,
as a result, these swaps were de-designated as fair value hedges. In January 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements, including the swaps which were previously de-designated as fair value hedges, and made a payment of $4.

Maturities.

Maturities of the Company’s debt for each of the next five years and thereafter at December 31, 2007 are
as follows:

11.    Subordinated Convertible Debentures

The subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary that has issued preferred
securities. This subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust.

In August 1998, a subsidiary trust (the “Trust”) of Holdings issued and sold $300 of
QUIPS in a private offering. The Trust used the proceeds from the offering to purchase 6


/


percent convertible subordinated
debentures due 2028 (the “Debentures”) which resulted in Holdings receiving all of the net proceeds of the offering. The QUIPS are non-voting securities, carry a liquidation value of $50 (fifty dollars) per security and are convertible
into the Company’s common stock. The initial convertible rate was 1.146 shares of common stock per preferred security (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $43.63 per share).

In August and October 2006, we announced redemptions of an aggregate of $76 of QUIPS. The redemption price was 101.3 percent. In conjunction with the
redemptions, we retired $76 of our Debentures. The redemptions were funded with the proceeds of stock option exercises received during 2006. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the aggregate amount of Debentures outstanding was $146.

Holders of the QUIPS are entitled to preferential cumulative cash distributions from the Trust
at an annual rate of 6


/


percent of the liquidation value, accruing from the original issue date and payable quarterly in
arrears beginning February 1, 1999. The distribution rate and dates correspond to the interest rate and payment dates on the Debentures. Holdings may defer quarterly interest payments on the Debentures for up to twenty consecutive quarters, but
not beyond the maturity date of the Debentures. If Holdings’ quarterly interest payments on the Debentures are deferred, so are the corresponding cash distribution payments on the QUIPS. During any period


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

(Dollars in

in which Holdings is deferring its quarterly interest payments, Holdings will be prohibited from paying dividends on any of its capital stock or making
principal, interest or other payments on debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures.

Holdings has executed a
guarantee with regard to payment of the QUIPS to the extent that the Trust has insufficient funds to make the required payments.

each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 are as follows:

The components of deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. We did not record any unrecognized
income tax benefits as a result of the implementation of FIN 48. At the adoption date of January 1, 2007, we had $6 of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2007, we
had $7 of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Includes cash tax payments and/or reductions in tax attributes with State, Federal and Canadian authorities, and settlement of filing issues with states.

Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we included interest accrued on the underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and penalties, if any, related
to unrecognized tax benefits in selling, general and administrative expense. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we have continued to follow this policy. For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest expense of less than $1 related to income tax was
reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The Company has recognized contingent receivables (included in other current assets) as offsets to additions for tax positions of prior years.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. and in several foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we have completed our domestic and international income
tax examinations, or the statute of limitations has expired in the respective jurisdictions, for years prior to 2004. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed audits for periods prior to 2006; Canadian authorities have concluded income tax
audits for periods prior to 2005, and the Company has agreed to these findings. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 are certain tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of the
unrecognized tax benefits for those tax positions could significantly change during the next twelve months. However, based on the status of the ongoing audit examinations and alternative settlement options available to the Company for certain of
these tax positions, which could include legal proceedings, it is not possible to estimate the amount of the change, if any, to the previously recorded uncertain tax positions.

For financial reporting purposes, income from continuing operations before income taxes for our
foreign subsidiaries was $65, $42 and $34 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries were approximately $88. Since it is our intention to
indefinitely reinvest these earnings, no United States taxes have been provided for these amounts. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted taxes is not practicable.

We have net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL’s”) of $636 for state income tax purposes that expire from 2008 through 2027. We have
recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred asset of $1 and $19 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we recorded benefits of $15, in the aggregate, within the income tax
provision relating to the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets and NOL’s. During 2007, we also released the remaining valuation allowance of $1, which had been previously recorded for foreign tax
credit carryforwards that expire from 2009 through 2016.

13.    Commitments and Contingencies

SEC Non-Public Fact Finding Inquiry and Special Committee Review

In August 2004, we received a letter from the SEC in which the SEC referred to an inquiry of the Company. The letter transmitted a subpoena requesting certain of our documents. The letter and the subpoena referred to
an SEC investigation entitled

In the Matter of United Rentals, Inc.

The notice from the SEC stated that the inquiry did not mean that the SEC had concluded that the Company or anyone else had broken the law or that the SEC had a negative
opinion of any person, entity or security. The inquiry appeared to relate to a broad range of our accounting practices and was not confined to a specific period.

In March 2005, our board of directors formed the Special Committee to review matters related to the SEC inquiry. The Special Committee retained independent counsel. The board of directors received and acted upon
findings of the Special Committee in January 2006. The actions that we took with respect to the Special Committee’s findings and actions that we took with respect to certain other accounting matters, including the restatement of previously
issued consolidated financial statements for 2003 and 2002, are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 (the “2005 Form 10-K”). We have provided documents in response to SEC subpoenas and
informal requests as well as to the Special Committee, which has, in turn, provided documents to the SEC.

As previously reported, the
Special Committee’s findings included, among others, that there were irregularities with respect to certain minor sale-leaseback transactions and trade packages to which the Company was a party between 2000 and 2002. The Company restated its
results for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, and its originally reported retained earnings at December 31, 2001, to correct the accounting for the minor sale-leaseback transactions and provided supplemental
disclosure in the 2005 10-K regarding the trade packages (with respect to which documentation sufficient to permit a restatement did not exist). The Special Committee concluded that, based on the evidence it reviewed, the practices regarding these
minor sale-leaseback transactions and trade packages appeared to have been directed by the Company’s two former chief financial officers. In December 2007, one of these former chief financial officers, who left the Company in late 2002, pled
guilty to making a false filing with the SEC in connection with the Company’s annual report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 and settled a separate civil enforcement action brought against him by the SEC alleging various
violations of the securities laws.

In July 2007, we received a letter from the staff of the SEC stating that the staff intended to
recommend that the Commission authorize the staff to file an injunctive action against the Company for alleged violations of

provisions relating to the maintenance of books and records, internal accounting controls, and periodic filing requirements, as well as antifraud provisions,
as set forth in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and
Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder. The letter states that the relief the staff may recommend includes permanent injunctions and civil penalties. Under SEC procedures, we have the opportunity to respond to the SEC staff
before the staff makes a formal recommendation as to whether any action should be brought by the SEC. The staff’s letter also states that the staff intends to request authorization to engage in settlement discussions with the Company. We intend
to continue cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut has also
requested information from the Company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the SEC inquiry. We are also cooperating fully with this office.

We cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries as to the Company or when these matters might be resolved.

Shareholder
Class Action Lawsuits and Derivative Litigation

Following our public announcement of the SEC inquiry, three purported class action
lawsuits were filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiff in each of the lawsuits initially sought to sue on behalf of a purported class comprised of purchasers of our securities from
October 23, 2003 to August 30, 2004. The lawsuits initially named as the defendants the Company, our former chairman, our vice chairman and then chief executive officer, our former president and chief financial officer, and our former
corporate controller. These initial complaints alleged, among other things, that certain of our SEC filings and other public statements contained false and misleading statements which resulted in damages to the plaintiffs and the members of the
purported class when they purchased our securities. On the basis of those allegations, plaintiffs in each action asserted claims (a) against all defendants under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and
(b) against one or more of the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints sought unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses. On February 1, 2005, the Court entered an order consolidating
the three actions. On November 8, 2005, the Court appointed City of Pontiac Policeman’s and Fireman’s Retirement System as lead plaintiff for the purported class. The consolidated action is now entitled

In re United Rentals, Inc.
Securities Litigation

.

On June 5, 2006, pursuant to a schedule agreed to by the parties and approved by the Court, lead plaintiff
filed a consolidated amended complaint, which (a) added allegations relating to, among other things, the conclusions of the Special Committee and other matters disclosed in the 2005 Form 10-K, (b) amended the purported class period to
include purchasers of our securities from February 28, 2001 to August 30, 2004 and (c) named as an additional defendant our first chief financial officer. In September 2006, we and certain of the individual defendants moved to dismiss
the consolidated amended complaint in this action. Briefing with respect to these motions is now complete. We intend to continue to defend against this action vigorously. At this stage of the litigation, it is not possible to estimate the amount of
loss or range of possible loss that might result from an adverse judgment or a settlement of this matter.

In January 2005, an alleged
shareholder filed an action in Connecticut State Superior Court, Judicial District of Norwalk/Stamford at Stamford, purportedly suing derivatively on the Company’s behalf. The action, entitled

Gregory Riegel v. John N. Milne, et al.

,
named as defendants certain of our current and/or former directors and/or


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

officers, and named the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint asserted, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to
the Company by causing or allowing the Company to disseminate misleading and inaccurate information to shareholders and the market and by failing to establish and maintain adequate accounting controls, thus exposing the Company to damages. The
complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses against the defendants. The parties to the

Riegel

action have agreed that the proceedings in this action will be stayed pending the resolution of the motions to dismiss in
the purported shareholder class actions.

In November 2004 we received a letter from counsel for an alleged shareholder, raising
allegations similar to the ones set forth in the derivative complaint described above and demanding that the Company take action in response to those allegations against certain of our current and/or former directors and/or officers. Following
receipt of the letter, our board of directors formed a special committee to consider the letter. In August 2005, this alleged shareholder commenced an action in Connecticut State Superior Court, Judicial District of Norwalk/Stamford at Stamford,
purporting to sue derivatively on the Company’s behalf. The action, entitled

Nathan Brundridge v. Leon D. Black, et al.

, initially named as defendants certain of our current and/or former directors and/or officers, and named the Company
as a nominal defendant. The initial complaint in this action asserted, among other things, that all of the defendants breached fiduciary obligations to the Company by causing or allowing the Company to disseminate misleading and inaccurate
information to shareholders and the market, and by failing to establish and maintain adequate accounting controls, thus exposing the Company to damages. The initial complaint in this action also asserted a claim for unjust enrichment against our
former chairman and our vice chairman and then chief executive officer. The initial complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages, equitable relief, costs and expenses against all of the defendants. The initial complaint also sought an order, in
connection with plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim, directing the defendants against whom that claim was asserted to disgorge certain compensation they received from us with respect to fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.

On June 5, 2006, pursuant to a schedule agreed to by the parties, plaintiff in the

Brundridge

action filed an amended complaint that
(a) added allegations relating to, among other things, the conclusions of the Special Committee and other matters disclosed in the 2005 Form 10-K, and (b) named as an additional defendant our former president and chief financial officer
and asserted the same claims against him as it previously asserted and continued to assert against our former chairman and our vice chairman and then chief executive officer. In September 2006, we and certain of the individual defendants moved to
dismiss the amended complaint in this action. In December 2006, plaintiff in this action filed its opposition to these motions to dismiss. Subsequently, the parties agreed that the proceedings in this action will be stayed pending resolution of the
motions to dismiss in the purported shareholder class actions. The parties’ agreement provides that any party may terminate the stay at any time on 30 days’ written notice to the Court and all other parties, and defendants will have an
opportunity to submit reply papers in further support of their motions to dismiss this action after the termination of the stay.

In August 2005, another alleged shareholder filed an action in the United States District Court for
the District of Connecticut, purporting to sue derivatively on the Company’s behalf. The action, entitled

Natalie Gordon v. Wayland R. Hicks, et al.

, named as defendants certain of our current and/or former directors and/or officers, and
named the Company as a nominal defendant. The initial complaint in this action asserted claims against each of the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. Each
of these claims is premised on, among other things, the theory that the individual defendants caused or permitted the Company to disseminate misleading and inaccurate information to shareholders and to the market, and failed to establish and
maintain adequate accounting controls, thus exposing the Company to damages. The initial complaint also asserted (a) a claim that a former director breached fiduciary obligations by selling shares of our common stock while in possession of
material, non-public information, and (b) a claim against our former chairman, our vice chairman and then chief executive officer, and our former president and chief financial officer for recovery of certain incentive-based compensation under
section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX 304”). The initial complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages, equitable relief, restitution, costs and expenses against all of the defendants. The initial complaint also sought an order
declaring that the defendants against whom the SOX 304 claim was directed are liable under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and directing them to reimburse us for all bonuses or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation they received for the fiscal
years 1999 through 2004.

On June 5, 2006, pursuant to a schedule agreed to by the parties and approved by the Court, plaintiff in the

Gordon

action filed an amended complaint, which (a) added allegations relating to, among other things, the conclusions of the Special Committee and other matters disclosed in the 2005 Form 10-K, and (b) named as additional
defendants certain other of our current and/or former directors and/or officers. The amended complaint also asserted an additional claim against certain of our current and/or former directors for violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act.
In September 2006, we and certain of the individual defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. Briefing with respect to these motions is now complete.

Following our July 23, 2007 announcement of the merger agreement with affiliates of Cerberus, two lawsuits against the proposed acquisition were
filed. First, a putative class action complaint, entitled

Donald Lefari v. United Rentals, Inc. et al.

, was filed in Connecticut State Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk, on July 23, 2007 (the “

Lefari

action”). This lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of all common stockholders of the Company, names the Company and all of our directors and Cerberus as defendants, and sought to enjoin the proposed acquisition of the Company by affiliates
of Cerberus. On September 19, 2007, the parties to the

Lefari

action entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the action and a settlement agreement was expected to be negotiated by the parties. On September 28, 2007, the
second lawsuit,

Nathan Brundridge vs. Wayland R. Hicks et al.

, was also filed in Connecticut State Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (the “

Brundridge II

action”). This lawsuit named our current directors
as defendants. On December 23, 2007, the Company terminated the merger agreement with affiliates of Cerberus. As a result, a condition precedent of the proposed settlement of the

Lefari

action, the consummation of the proposed
acquisition, was not fulfilled. The

Brundridge II

action was voluntarily withdrawn as to all defendants on January 30, 2008. On February 7, 2008, the parties to the

Lefari

action filed a joint motion to withdraw with
prejudice the

Lefari

action, which is subject to the approval of the court.

Following our November 14, 2007 announcement that
affiliates of Cerberus had notified us that they were not prepared to proceed with the purchase of the Company on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, three putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company in the United States
District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiff in each of the lawsuits sought to sue on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between August 29, 2007 and November 14, 2007.
The lawsuits


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

named as defendants the Company, our directors and certain of our officers and alleged, among other things, that the named plaintiff and members of the
purported class suffered damages when they purchased or otherwise acquired securities issued by the Company, as a result of false and misleading statements and/or material omissions relating to the contemplated merger with affiliates of Cerberus,
contained in (a) proxy materials that the Company disseminated and/or filed with the SEC in anticipation of the October 19, 2007 special meeting of stockholders; and/or (b) certain of the Company’s filings with the SEC and other
public statements. On the basis of those allegations, plaintiff in each action asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder; and against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act. The complaints in these actions sought unspecified compensatory damages, costs, expenses and fees. On February 7, 2008, the Court entered an order consolidating the three actions and appointing the Institutional Investor
Group, consisting of First New York Securities, L.L.C. and Omni Partners LLP, as lead plaintiff for the purported class. The consolidated action is now entitled

In re United Rentals, Inc. Securities Litigation.

We intend to defend against
this action vigorously.

We are also subject to a number of claims and proceedings that generally arise in the ordinary conduct of our
business. These matters include, but are not limited to, general liability claims (including personal injury, product liability, and property and auto claims), indemnification and guarantee obligations, employee injuries and employment-related
claims, self-insurance obligations and contract and real estate matters. Based on advice of counsel and available information, including current status or stage of proceeding, and taking into account accruals for matters where we have established
them, we currently believe that any liabilities ultimately resulting from these ordinary course claims and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Indemnification

The Company indemnifies its officers and directors pursuant to indemnification agreements and may in addition indemnify these individuals as permitted by Delaware law. Accordingly, in connection with the purported class action lawsuit,
three purported shareholder derivative lawsuits, the SEC inquiry, the U.S. Attorney’s Office inquiry and related review of the Special Committee described above, the Company has advanced counsel fees and other reasonable fees and expenses,
actually and necessarily incurred by the present and former directors and officers who are involved, in an aggregate amount of approximately $7. Each of the individuals is required to execute an undertaking to repay such expenses if he or she is
finally found not to be entitled to indemnification.

Operating Leases

We lease rental equipment, real estate and certain office equipment under operating leases. Certain real estate leases require us to pay maintenance, insurance, taxes and certain other expenses in addition to the
stated rental payments. Future minimum lease payments, by year and in the aggregate, for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows at December 31, 2007:


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

Rent expense under all non-cancelable real estate, rental equipment and other equipment operating
leases totaled $148, $161 and $167 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our real estate leases provide for varying terms, including leases subject to customary escalation clauses.

Restricted Stock Awards

We have granted to employees
other than executive officers and directors approximately 39,000 shares of restricted stock that have not yet vested. The shares vest in 2008 and are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting upon certain terminations of employment, the violation of
non-compete provisions and certain other events. If a holder of restricted stock sells his stock and receives sales proceeds that are less than a specified guaranteed amount set forth in the grant instrument, we have agreed to pay the holder the
shortfall between the amount received and such specified amount; however, the foregoing only applies to sales that are made within five trading days of the vesting date. The specified guaranteed amount is $19.86 per share.

Employee Benefit Plans

We currently sponsor three
defined contribution 401(k) retirement plans which are subject to the provisions of ERISA. We also sponsor a deferred profit sharing plan for the benefit of the full-time employees of our Canadian subsidiaries. Under these plans, we match a
percentage of the participants’ contributions up to a specified amount. Company contributions to the plans were $8, $8 and $6 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Environmental Matters

The Company and its operations are subject to various laws and related
regulations governing environmental matters. Under such laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as
well as investigation of property damage. We incur ongoing expenses associated with the removal of underground storage tanks and the performance of appropriate remediation at certain of our locations.

14.    Preferred Stock

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have two classes of preferred stock outstanding. In total, we are authorized to issue 5 million shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value, of which an aggregate of 450,000 have been issued.

Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred.

There are 300,000 shares of our Series C Preferred outstanding and 150,000 shares of our Series D
Preferred outstanding. The Series D Preferred includes 105,252 shares designated as Class D-l and 44,748 shares designated as Class D-2. The rights of the two classes of Series D Preferred are substantially the same, except that only the Class D-l
has the voting rights described below.

Principal terms of the Series C Preferred
and Series D Preferred include the following (subject to the special provisions described below that will apply in the event of certain Non-Approved Change of Control transactions): (i) each share is entitled to a liquidation preference of
$1,000 per share; (ii) at the holder’s option, each share of Series C Preferred is convertible into 40 shares of common stock subject to adjustment (representing a conversion price of $25 per share based on the liquidation preference) and
each share of Series D Preferred is convertible into 33


/3 shares of common stock subject to adjustment (representing a conversion

price of $30 per share based on the liquidation preference); (iii) the holders of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred (on an as converted
basis) and the holders of the common stock vote together as a single class on all matters (except that the Series C Preferred may vote as a separate class as described in the next clause); (iv) the holders of the Series C Preferred, voting
separately as a single class, may elect two directors (subject to reduction to one, if the shares of Series C Preferred owned by specified holders cease to represent, on an as converted basis, at least eight million shares of common stock, and
reduction to zero, if such shares of Series C Preferred cease to represent at least four million shares of common stock), (v) there are no stated dividends on the Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred, but the Series C Preferred and Series D
Preferred, on an as converted basis, will participate in any dividends declared on the common stock, (vi) upon the occurrence of specified change of control transactions, other than a Non-Approved Change of Control (as defined below), we must
offer to redeem the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to 6.25 percent of the liquidation preference compounded annually from January 1999 in the case of the Series
C Preferred, and September 1999 in the case of the Series D Preferred, to the redemption date, (vii) if we issue for cash common stock (or a series of preferred stock convertible into common stock) and the price for the common stock is below
the conversion price of the Series C Preferred, then we must offer to repurchase a specified portion of the outstanding Series C Preferred at the price per share set forth in the preceding clause, and (viii) if we issue for cash common stock
(or a series of preferred stock convertible into common stock) for a price for the common stock below the conversion price of the Series D Preferred, then we must offer to repurchase a specified portion of the outstanding Series D Preferred at the
price per share specified in the second preceding clause. In addition to these rights, the holders of the Preferred must give consent for (i) distributions or dividends on, or self-tenders for, the Company’s capital stock within any 12
month period that exceed 5 percent of the Company’s market capitalization (as defined, subject to adjustment) and (ii) capital stock repurchases within any 12 month period that exceed 7.5 percent of the Company’s market capitalization
(as defined, subject to adjustment).

Special Rights of Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred Upon Non-Approved Change of
Control.

In general, a Non-Approved Change of Control transaction is a change of control transaction that the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has disapproved and which the Board has not facilitated by such actions as weakening or
eliminating the Company’s Stockholder Rights Plan. If a Non-Approved Change of Control occurs, and the Board does not offer the holders of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred essentially the same redemption rights that apply to an
Approved Change of Control transaction: (i) the holders of the Series C Preferred would elect a majority of the Board for a specified period, (ii) the holders of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred would be entitled to an
additional 6.25 percent return on the liquidation preference, compounded annually from January 1999 for the Series C Preferred and from September 1999 for the Series D Preferred, (iii) after the holders of the common stock receive an amount
equivalent to the liquidation preference, the holders of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred would share with the holders of the common stock, on an as converted basis, in any remaining amounts available for distribution, and (iv) the
Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred would accrue dividends at a maximum annual rate, compounded annually, equal to 18 percent of the liquidation preference.

15.    Common Stock

We have 500 million authorized shares of common stock, $0.01 par value. At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were (i) 0.5 million and 5.7 million shares of common stock reserved for the exercise of warrants, respectively, (ii) 4.6 million and 6.4 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance
pursuant to options granted under our stock option plans, respectively, (iii) 3.3 million shares of common stock reserved for the issuance of outstanding preferred securities of a subsidiary trust, (iv) 17 million shares of common
stock reserved for the issuance of Series C and Series D preferred stock and (v) 6.5 million shares of common stock reserved for the conversion of convertible debt.

Stockholders’ Rights Plan.

We adopted a Stockholders’ Rights Plan on
September 28, 2001. This plan, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company, including transactions in which
our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market prices. The rights expire on September 27, 2011.

16.    Related Party

We have from time to time purchased equipment and parts from and sold equipment to
Terex Corporation (“Terex”) and expect to do so in 2008. One of our former directors (until June 2005) is chairman and chief executive officer of Terex. We purchased approximately $88, $150 and $153, of equipment and parts from Terex
during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also sold approximately $1, $0 and $7, of equipment to Terex during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, amounts due to Terex were $5 and $11, respectively, and there
were no amounts due from Terex for either period.

17.    Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

(1)

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we received $100 following the termination of our merger agreement with Cerberus. This amount has been included in other income in our
consolidated statements of income, net of related transaction costs of $1, $2 and $6 which were incurred in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2007, respectively. The second and third quarter transaction costs previously classified in SG&A
have been reclassified to other income to conform to the fourth quarter and full year presentation. The fourth quarter also reflects a reduction in our reserve for obsolescence and shrinkage of $4. This benefit, which was recognized following our
annual physical inventory inspections, was recorded in cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we recognized a benefit of $3 reflecting recent experience related to our estimated provision for
self-insurance reserves. This benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation.

(2)

Other income for the fourth quarter of 2007 includes $17 of net foreign currency transaction gains relating to intercompany transactions primarily between our
Canadian subsidiary and our U.S subsidiaries. Prior to


UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in
millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)

the fourth quarter of 2007, we had been reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on these intercompany transactions as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity, rather than including them in income. Of the $17 recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007, $1, $5 and $5 relates to exchange rate movements which occurred in the first, second and third quarters
of 2007, respectively, and $4 relates to periods prior to 2007; all of these amounts have been recognized in the fourth quarter as a correction. This correction does not affect historical or future cash flows and its effect on our current and prior
years’ net income, cash flows from operations, and stockholders’ equity is not material.

(3)

During the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded an after-tax loss of $24, reflected within discontinued operations, related to the sale of our traffic control business as well as a
charge of $9 reflecting recent loss experience related to our estimated provision for self-insurance reserves. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed our annual physical inventory inspections and determined that our reserve
for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage was overstated. As a result of this change in estimate, we reduced our provision for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage by $10. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded a charge of $7
related to our estimated exposure for sales-tax matters.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, if dilutive, the Series C and

19.     Condensed Consolidating Financial Information of Guarantor Subsidiaries

URNA is 100 percent owned by Holdings (the “Parent”) and has outstanding (i) certain indebtedness that is guaranteed by
the Parent and (ii) certain indebtedness that is guaranteed by both Parent and substantially all of URNA’s United States subsidiaries (the “guarantor subsidiaries”). However, this indebtedness is not guaranteed by URNA’s
foreign subsidiaries (the “non-guarantor subsidiaries”) and certain of its United States subsidiaries. The guarantor subsidiaries are all 100 percent-owned and the guarantees are made on a joint and several basis and are full and
unconditional (subject to subordination provisions and subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void
under fraudulent conveyance laws). Separate consolidated financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented because management believes that such information would not be material to investors. However, condensed
consolidating financial information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, are presented. The condensed consolidating financial information of the Company and its
subsidiaries are as follows:

disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company’s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a–15(e) and 15d–15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2007. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment,
our management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

The Company’s financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young LLP has also provided an attestation
report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of United Rentals, Inc.

We have audited United Rentals, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). United Rentals, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, United Rentals, Inc.’s maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets
of United Rentals, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 of United Rentals,
Inc. and our report dated February 25, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
