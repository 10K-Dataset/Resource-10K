PART I

Unless otherwise indicated, the information under Items 1 and
2 is as of March 1, 2003.

Item 1.    Business

General

United Rentals
is the largest equipment rental company in the world. We offer for rent over 600 types of equipment—everything from heavy machines to hand tools—through our network of more than 750 rental locations in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Our customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and others. In 2002, we added 300,000 new customers increasing our total customer base to 1.7 million, completed over 8.6 million
rental transactions and generated revenues of $2.8 billion.

Our fleet of rental equipment, the largest in the world, includes over 500,000 units having an original purchase price of approximately $3.7 billion. The fleet includes:

•

General construction and industrial equipment,

such as backhoes, skid-steer loaders, forklifts, earth moving equipment, material handling equipment,
compressors, pumps and generators;

•

Aerial work platforms

, such as scissor lifts and boom lifts;

•

General tools and light equipment

, such as power washers, water pumps, heaters and hand tools;

•

Traffic control equipment

, such as barricades, cones, warning lights, message boards and pavement marking systems; and

•

Trench safety equipment

for below ground work, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers
and line testing equipment.

In
addition to renting equipment, we sell used rental equipment, act as a dealer for new equipment and sell related merchandise, parts and service.



Industry Overview

Based on industry sources, we estimate that
the U.S. equipment rental industry has grown from approximately $6.5 billion in annual rental revenues in 1990 to about $24 billion in 2002. This represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 11.5%, although in the past two years
industry rental revenues decreased by about $2 billion. The recent downturn in industry revenues is a reflection of the significant slowdown in private non-residential construction activity, which declined 16% in 2002 according to Department of
Commerce data. Our industry is particularly sensitive to changes in non-residential construction activity because this sector has been the principal user of rental equipment. When non-residential construction activity eventually rebounds, we would
expect to see our industry resume its long-term growth trend.

We believe that long-term industry growth, in addition to reflecting general economic expansion, is being driven by the increasing recognition by equipment users of the many advantages that equipment rental may offer compared with
ownership. They recognize that by renting they can:

•

avoid the large capital investment required for equipment purchases;

•

access a broad selection of equipment and select the equipment best suited for each particular job;

•

reduce storage and maintenance costs; and

•

access the latest technology without investing in new equipment.

While the construction industry has to date been the principal user of rental equipment, industrial
companies, utilities and others are increasingly using rental equipment for plant maintenance, plant turnarounds and other functions requiring the periodic use of equipment. We believe that over the long term increasing rentals by the industrial
sector could become a more significant factor in driving our industry’s growth.

Competitive Advantages

We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages:

Large and Diverse Rental Fleet.

Our rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry, which allows us to:

•

attract customers by providing “one-stop” shopping;

•

serve a diverse customer base and reduce our dependence on any particular customer or group of customers; and

•

serve customers that require substantial quantities and/or wide varieties of equipment.

Significant Purchasing Power.

We purchase large amounts of equipment,
merchandise and other items, which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing, warranty and other terms with our vendors.

Operating Efficiencies

.    We benefit from the following operating efficiencies:

Equipment Sharing Among
Branches

.    We generally group our branches into clusters of 10 to 30 locations that are in the same geographic area. Each branch within a cluster can access all available equipment in the cluster area. This increases
equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches. In 2002, the sharing of equipment among branches accounted for approximately 11.3%, or $243 million, of our total rental revenue.

Ability to Transfer Equipment Among
Branches

.    The size of our branch network gives us the ability to take advantage of strength at a particular branch or in a particular region by permanently transferring underutilized equipment from weaker to stronger
areas. In 2002, we permanently transferred $890 million of underutilized fleet in this manner.



Consolidation of Common Functions

.    We reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our more than 750 branches, such as payroll, accounts payable, benefits and risk management,
information technology and credit and collection, into 17 credit offices and three service centers.

State-of-the-Art Information Technology Systems.

We have state-of-the-art information technology
systems that facilitate our ability to make rapid and informed decisions, respond quickly to changing market conditions, and share equipment among branches. We have an in-house team of 97 information technology specialists that supports our systems.

Strong Brand
Recognition.

We have strong brand recognition, which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty.

Geographic and Customer Diversity.

We have more than 750 branches in 47 states, seven Canadian
provinces and Mexico and serve customers that range from Fortune 500 companies to small companies and homeowners. In 2002, we served more than 1.7 million customers and our top ten customers accounted for less than 3% of our revenues. We believe
that our geographic and customer diversity provide us with many advantages including: (1) enabling us to better serve National Account customers with multiple locations, (2) helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used
equipment resale markets across the country, (3) reducing our dependence on any particular customer and (4) reducing the impact that fluctuations in regional economic conditions have on our overall financial performance.

National Account
Program.

Our National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. We offer our National Account
customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across North America, a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs. We currently serve 1,735 National Account customers. As the number of our
National Account customers has grown, our revenues from these customers have increased to $422 million in 2002 from $372 million in 2001 and $245 million in 2000.

Strong and Motivated Branch Management.

Each of our branches has a
full-time branch manager who is supervised by one of our 57 district managers and nine regional vice presidents. We believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry, and we empower them—within budgetary
guidelines—to make day-to-day decisions concerning branch matters. Senior management closely tracks branch, district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls, including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating
reviews. The compensation of branch managers and other branch personnel is linked to their branch’s financial performance and return on assets. This incentivizes branch personnel to control costs, optimize pricing, share equipment with other
branches and manage their fleet efficiently.

Employee Training Programs

.    We have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on methods for maximizing the value of each transaction. In 2002, more than 4,000 of
our employees enhanced their skills through 69,400 total hours of internal training.

Risk Management and Safety Programs.

We believe that we have one of the most comprehensive risk management and safety programs in the industry. Our risk management
department is staffed by 54 experienced professionals and is responsible for implementing our safety programs and procedures, developing our employee and customer training programs and managing any claims against us.

Products and Services

Our principal products and services are described below. For
financial information concerning our foreign and domestic operations, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.



Equipment
Rental.

We offer for rent over 600 different types of equipment on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. The types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment; aerial work platforms;
traffic control equipment; trench safety equipment; and general tools and light equipment.

Our fleet of rental equipment is the largest in the world and includes over 500,000 units having an original purchase price of approximately $3.7 billion. We estimate that each of the following
categories accounted for 10% or more of our equipment rental revenues in 2002: (i) aerial lift equipment (approximately 27%), (ii) earth moving equipment (approximately 13%) and (iii) forklifts (approximately 10%).

Our fleet of rental equipment, which currently has a weighted
average age of 36 months, is one of the newest and best maintained in the industry. We intend to increase the weighted average age of our fleet to about 42 months by the end of 2003. Over the longer term, we may further increase the average age of
our fleet to about 45 months. This plan reflects our belief that the optimum age of our fleet is somewhat higher than where it is today. In estimating the optimum age of our fleet, we have taken into account a number of factors, including our
current estimates regarding the relationship between age and reliability and maintenance costs and the capital expenditures required to maintain the fleet at a particular age. We will continue to evaluate these factors and, if our estimates prove
inaccurate, may modify our plan.

Used
Equipment Sales.

We routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage the age, composition and size of our fleet. We also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for this
equipment. The rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors, including changing general economic conditions, growth opportunities, the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer requirements and
local demand, and the age of the fleet.

We
principally sell used equipment through our national sales force, which can access many resale markets across North America. We also sell used equipment through our website (www.unitedrentals.com), which includes an online database of used equipment
available for sale.

New Equipment
Sales.

We are a dealer for many leading equipment manufacturers. The manufacturers that we represent and the brands that we carry include: Genie and JLG (aerial lifts); Multiquip, Wacker, Bomag, and Honda USA (compaction
equipment, generators, and pumps); Sullair (compressors); Skytrak and Lull (rough terrain reach forklifts); Bobcat, Thomas and Takeuchi (skid-steer loaders and mini-excavators); and Terex (off-road dump trucks and telehandlers). Typically,
dealership agreements do not have a specific term and may be terminated at any time. The type of new equipment that we sell varies by location.

Related Merchandise, Parts and Other Services.

At most of our branches, we sell a variety of supplies and
merchandise such as saw blades, fasteners, drill bits, hard hats, gloves and other safety equipment and we also offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers.

We have launched a program to increase merchandise sales
across our network by building on the best practices of our strongest retail locations. As part of this program, we are (1) upgrading merchandise displays, (2) adding merchandise sales representatives, and (3) bringing the merchandise to our
customers through catalogues and job-site “trailer” stores. Our goal is to double our merchandise sales over the next two to three years.

Our Rentalman

™

Software.

We have a subsidiary that develops and markets Rentalman

TM

software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations. This software package developed by this subsidiary is used
by many of the largest equipment rental companies.

Customers

Our customer
base is highly diversified and ranges from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 1% of our revenues in 2002 and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 3% of our revenues in
2002.



Our customer
base varies by branch and is determined by several factors, including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch and the business composition of the local economy. Our customers include:

•

construction companies that use equipment for building and renovating commercial buildings, warehouses, industrial and manufacturing plants, office parks, airports,
residential developments and other facilities;

•

industrial companies—such as manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders and utilities—that use equipment for plant
maintenance, upgrades, expansion and construction;

•

municipalities that require equipment for a variety of purposes, such as traffic control and highway construction and maintenance; and

•

homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.

Sales and Marketing

General

We market our products and services through multiple channels
as described below.

Sales
Force.

As of March 7, 2003, we had a total of 2,487 salespeople, including 1,217 store-based sales coordinators and 1,270 field-based salespeople. Our sales force calls on existing and potential customers and assists our
customers in planning for their equipment needs.

National Account Program.

Our National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence.
The National Account team closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area. Our National Account team currently includes 34 sales professionals.

E-Rental Store

™

.

Our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day seven days a week at our E-Rental Store

™

, which is part of our website. Our customers can also use our UR

data

™

application to access up-to-the-minute reports on their business activity with us.

Advertising.

We promote our
business through local and national advertising in various media, including trade publications, Yellow Pages, the Internet, radio and direct mail. We also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local
promotional events.

Sales Training
Programs

We have ongoing programs for
training our employees in sales and service skills and on methods for maximizing the value of each transaction. As part of this training, our employees are taught to differentiate United Rentals to customers by communicating the benefits we
offer—stability, accessibility, equipment knowledge, extensive fleet and high service level.

Suppliers

We have been making ongoing efforts to consolidate our vendor base in order to further increase our purchasing power. We estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 19% of our rental equipment purchases in
2002, and that our top 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70% of our rental equipment purchases during that period. We believe that we have alternative sources of supply for each of our material equipment categories.



Information Technology
Systems

We have advanced information
technology systems, which facilitate rapid and informed decision-making and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and
to our AS/400 system located at our data center. All rental transactions are entered at these workstations and processed on a real-time basis. Management and branch personnel can access the systems 24 hours a day.

These systems:

•

allow management to obtain a wide range of operating and financial data;

•

enable branch personnel to (1) determine equipment availability, (2) access all equipment within a geographic region and arrange for equipment to be delivered from
anywhere in the region directly to the customer, (3) monitor business activity on a real-time basis and (4) obtain customized reports on a wide range of operating and financial data, including equipment utilization, rental rate trends, maintenance
histories and customer transaction histories; and

•

permit customers to access their accounts online.

Our information technology systems and our website are supported by our in-house group of 97 information technology specialists. This
group trains our personnel at the branch location; upgrades and customizes our systems; provides hardware and technology support; operates a support desk to assist branch personnel in the day-to-day use of the systems; extends the systems to newly
acquired locations; and manages our website.

We
have a back-up facility designed to enable business continuity in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative. This backup facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal
ongoing operation of our information technology systems.

Competition

The
equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Our competitors primarily include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations; regional competitors which operate in one or more states; public companies or divisions
of public companies; and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We believe that, in general, large companies enjoy significant competitive advantages compared to smaller operators, including greater
purchasing power, a lower cost of capital, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services and with newer and better maintained equipment, and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to
customer demand. For additional information, see “—Competitive Advantages.”

Environmental and Safety Regulations

There are numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety. Under these laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable
on a no-fault basis for, among other things, (1) the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on, in, or emanating from, the real estate, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage and substantial
penalties, and (2) environmental contamination at facilities where its waste is or has been disposed. Activities that are or may be affected by these laws include our use of hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and our disposal of
solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing. We also dispense petroleum products from underground and aboveground storage tanks located at certain locations, and at times we must remove or upgrade tanks to comply with applicable
laws. We have acquired or lease certain locations, which have or may have been contaminated by leakage from underground tanks or other sources, and we are in the process of assessing the nature of the required remediation. Based on the conditions
currently known to us, we believe that any unreserved environmental remediation and compliance costs required with respect to those conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business. However, we cannot be certain that we will not
identify adverse environmental conditions that are not currently known to us, that all potential releases from underground storage tanks removed in the past have been identified, or that environmental and safety requirements will not become more
stringent or be interpreted and applied more



stringently in the future. If we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated by
us, our business could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost.

Employees

We
have 12,937 employees. Of these employees, 3,869 are salaried personnel and 9,068 are hourly personnel. Collective bargaining agreements relating to 79 separate locations cover 1,063 of our employees. We consider our relationship with our employees
to be satisfactory.

Item 2.    Properties

We currently operate 751 locations. Of these locations, 669 are in the United States, 81 are in Canada and one is in Mexico. The number of locations in each state or province is shown below.

United States

Our
branch locations generally include facilities for displaying equipment and, depending on the location, may include separate equipment service areas and storage areas.

We own 102 of our rental locations and lease the other locations. In addition to our rental locations we also
lease non-rental locations, for example district offices, region offices and service centers. Our leases provide for varying terms and include 43 leases that are on a month-to-month basis and 36 leases that provide for a remaining term of less than
one year and do not provide a renewal option. We are currently negotiating renewals for most of the leases that provide for a remaining term of less than one year.



We maintain a
fleet of approximately 10,400 vehicles. These vehicles are used for delivery, maintenance and sales functions. We own a portion of this fleet and lease a portion.

Our corporate headquarters are located in Greenwich, Connecticut, where we occupy approximately 40,000 square
feet under leases for (1) approximately 12,000 square feet that extends until 2003 and (2) approximately 28,000 square feet that extends until 2004 (subject to extension rights). The 28,000 square feet portion is sufficient for our needs and,
accordingly, we do not plan to renew the lease for the 12,000 square feet that expires in 2003.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are party to various litigation matters, in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability
with respect to such pending litigation matters. However, we believe, based on our examination of such matters, that our ultimate liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

During the fourth quarter of 2002, no matter was submitted to a vote of our security holders.



PART II

Item 5.    Market For Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “URI.” The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, the high and low sale prices for our common stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange.

As of
March 7, 2003, there were approximately 443 holders of record of our common stock. We believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of our common stock is held of
record in broker “street names.”

Dividend Policy

We intend to retain all earnings for the
foreseeable future for use in the operation and expansion of our business and, accordingly, we currently have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. The payment of any future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in light of
conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors. Under the terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding
indebtedness, we are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends on our common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, we are prohibited from paying any dividends unless we have capital surplus or net profits available for this purpose.



Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

You should read the following data together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Report and Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We completed a number of acquisitions during the periods presented below. We accounted for certain of these acquisitions as poolings-of-interests. This means that, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, the acquired company
is treated as having been combined with us at all times since the inception of the acquired company. Accordingly, we have restated our accounts to include the accounts of the businesses that we acquired in these pooling-of-interests transactions,
except in one case where the transaction was not material. We accounted for our other acquisitions as purchases. This means that the results of operations of the acquired company are included in our financial statements only from the date of
acquisition. We believe that our results for the periods presented below are not directly comparable because of the impact of the acquisitions accounted for as purchases. For additional information, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Report.



(1)

The charge in 1998 resulted from the early extinguishment of certain debt and primarily reflected prepayment penalties. The charge in 2001 resulted from the
refinancing of certain debt and primarily reflected the write-off of deferred financing fees.

(2)

The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2002 resulted from a goodwill impairment charge recognized upon the adoption of a new accounting standard.
See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Changes in Accounting Treatment for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Report.

(3)

A company that we acquired in a pooling-of-interests transaction was taxed as a Subchapter S Corporation until being acquired by us in 1998. In general, the income
or loss of a Subchapter S Corporation is passed through to its owners rather than being subjected to taxes at the entity level. Pro forma provision for income taxes before extraordinary items and pro forma income before extraordinary items reflect a
provision for income taxes as if such company was liable for federal and state income taxes as a taxable corporate entity for all periods presented.

(4)

Our earnings during 1998 were impacted by merger-related expenses of $47.2 million ($33.2 million net of tax or $0.45 per diluted share), a $4.8 million ($0.07 per
diluted share) charge to recognize deferred tax liabilities of a company acquired in a pooling-of-interests transaction and an extraordinary item (net of tax) of $21.3 million ($0.30 per diluted share). Our earnings during 1999 were impacted by
$18.2 million ($10.8 million net of tax or $0.12 per diluted share) of expenses incurred related to a terminated tender offer. Our earnings during 2001 were impacted by a restructuring charge of $28.9 million ($19.2 million net of tax or $0.20 per
diluted share), a $7.8 million ($5.2 million net of tax or $0.06 per diluted share) charge, recorded in other expense, relating to refinancing costs of a synthetic lease and an extraordinary item (net of tax) of $11.3 million ($0.12 per diluted
share). Our earnings during 2002 were impacted by a restructuring charge of $28.3 million ($17.3 million net of tax or $0.23 per share), a $247.9 million goodwill impairment charge ($198.8 million net of tax or $2.62 per share), a $1.6 million
charge ($0.9 million net of tax or $0.01 per share) recorded in other expense relating to refinancing costs, and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (net of tax) of $288.3 million ($3.80 per share).

(5)

Goodwill is defined as the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. Until January 1, 2002, goodwill was being amortized
on a straight-line basis over forty years. Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with the adoption of a new accounting standard, goodwill was no longer amortized. See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Changes in Accounting Treatment for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.

(6)

We issued series A and B perpetual convertible preferred stock in 1999 and included such preferred stock in stockholders’ equity. In July 2001, the SEC issued
guidance to all public companies as to when redeemable preferred stock may be classified as stockholders’ equity. Under this guidance, the series A and B preferred would not be included in stockholders’ equity because this stock would be
subject to mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control. On September 28, 2001, we entered into an agreement effecting the exchange of new series C and D perpetual convertible preferred stock for the series A and B preferred. The series C and
D preferred is not subject to mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control, and is included in stockholders’ equity under the recent SEC guidance. The effect of the foregoing is that our perpetual convertible preferred stock is included
in stockholders’ equity as of September 28, 2001 and thereafter, but is outside of stockholders’ equity for earlier dates.



Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

General

We are the largest equipment rental company in the world. Our revenues are divided into three categories:

•

Equipment rentals

—This category includes our revenues from renting equipment. This category also includes related revenues such as the fees we charge for
equipment delivery, fuel, repair of rental equipment and damage waivers.

•

Sales of rental equipment

—This category includes our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment.

•

Sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues

—This category principally includes our revenues from the following sources: (i) the sale of new
equipment, (ii) the sale of supplies and merchandise, (iii) repair services and the sale of parts for equipment owned by customers, and (iv) the operations of our subsidiary that develops and markets software for use by equipment rental companies in
managing and operating multiple branch locations.

Our cost of operations consists primarily of: (i) depreciation costs relating to the rental equipment that we own and lease payments for the rental equipment that we hold under operating leases, (ii) the cost of repairing and
maintaining rental equipment, (iii) the cost of the items that we sell including new and used equipment and related parts, merchandise and supplies and (iv) personnel costs, occupancy costs and supply costs.

We record rental equipment expenditures at cost and depreciate
equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life (which ranges from two to ten years), after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0% to 10% of cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include sales commissions, bad debt expense,
advertising and marketing expenses, management salaries, and clerical and administrative overhead.

Non-rental depreciation and amortization includes (i) depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent (such as
vehicles, computers and office equipment) and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements, (ii) the amortization of deferred financing costs and (iii) the amortization of other intangible assets. Our other intangible assets consist
of non-compete agreements. As described below, effective January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize goodwill.

We completed acquisitions in each of 2000, 2001 and 2002. See Note 3 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Report. In view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions, we believe that our results for these periods are not directly comparable.

Change in Accounting Treatment for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” issued by the Financial Accountants Standards Board (“FASB”). Under this standard, our goodwill, which we previously
amortized over 40 years, is no longer amortized. We amortized approximately $58.4 million of goodwill in 2001. Our approximately $17.0 million of other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Under the new
accounting standard, we are required to periodically review our goodwill for impairment. In general, this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill, calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards, is at least
equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value, we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense.

We completed our initial impairment analysis in the first quarter of 2002 and recorded a non-cash charge of
approximately $348.9 million ($288.3 million, net of tax). We completed a subsequent impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2002 and recorded an additional non-cash impairment charge of approximately



$247.9 million ($198.8 million, net of tax). The first impairment charge, net of tax benefit, was recorded on our statement of
operations as a “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle.” This charge appears below the operating income line and, accordingly, does not impact operating income. The second impairment charge was recorded on our statement
of operations as “goodwill impairment.” This charge appears above the operating income line and, accordingly, does impact operating income. Our stockholders’ equity was reduced by the amount of both charges.

We will be required to review our goodwill for further
impairment at least annually. Any future goodwill impairment charge would be recorded on our statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” and would reduce operating income.

We test for goodwill impairment on a branch-by-branch basis rather than on an aggregate basis. This means
that a goodwill write-off is required even if only one or a limited number of our branches has impairment and even if there is no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis. Factors that may cause future impairment at a particular branch,
in addition to macroeconomic factors that affect all our branches, include changes in local demand and local competitive conditions. The fact that we test for impairment on a branch-by-branch basis increases the likelihood that we will be required
to take additional non-cash goodwill write-offs in the future, although we cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future write-offs.

Critical Accounting Policies

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A summary of our
significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. In applying many accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. These
assumptions, estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of
operations. We have identified below those of our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions, estimates and judgments.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts. These allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect. Our estimate could require change based on changing
circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance.

Useful Lives of Rental Equipment and Property and Equipment.

We depreciate
rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives, after giving effect to an estimated salvage value of 0% to 10% of cost. The useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will
generate revenues, and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we could realize from the asset after such period. We may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing
circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets.

Impairment of Goodwill.

As described above, we must periodically determine whether the fair value of our
goodwill is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet. See “—Change in Accounting Treatment for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” We must make estimates and assumptions in evaluating the fair value of
goodwill. We may be required to change these estimates and assumptions based on changes in economic conditions, changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to record
additional impairment charges for goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

We review the valuation of our long-lived assets on an ongoing basis and assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired.
If this



review indicates that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, then the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair
value. The determination of recoverability is based upon a nondiscounted cash flow analysis over the asset’s remaining useful life. We must make estimates and assumptions when applying the nondiscounted cash flow analysis. These estimates and
assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize write-downs on
our long-lived assets.

Restructuring.

During 2002 and 2001, we recorded reserves in connection with the restructuring plans described below. These reserves include estimates pertaining to workforce reduction costs and costs of
vacating facilities and related settlements of contractual obligations. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates and we may be required to record additional expense not previously recorded.

Restructuring Plans in 2001 and 2002

We adopted a restructuring plan in April 2001 and a second
restructuring plan in October 2002 as described below. These plans were adopted in response to adverse changes in economic conditions and in branch performance in certain of our markets. In connection with these plans, we recorded a restructuring
charge of $28.9 million in 2001 (including a non-cash component of approximately $10.9 million) and $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 (including a non-cash component of approximately $2.5 million).

The 2001 plan involved the following principal elements: (i)
31 underperforming branches and five administrative offices were closed or consolidated with other locations, (ii) the reduction of our workforce by 489 through the termination of branch and administrative personnel, and (iii) certain information
technology hardware and software was no longer used.

The 2002 plan involved the following key elements: (i) 42 underperforming branches and five administrative offices will be closed or consolidated with other locations (including 26 closed or consolidated as of December 31, 2002);
(ii) our workforce will be reduced by 412 (including 232 terminated as of December 31, 2002), and (iii) a certain information technology project was abandoned. We expect to close or consolidate the remainder of the branches and complete the
workforce reduction during 2003.

The aggregate
annual revenues from the 42 branches that are being eliminated as part of the 2002 restructuring amounted to approximately $80 million. We estimate that we will retain a substantial portion of these revenues because we expect to: (i) redeploy most
of the rental equipment of the eliminated branches to other branches that we project will be able to use this equipment to increase revenues and (ii) shift a portion of the customer base of the eliminated branches to other locations. We cannot,
however, be certain that redeployed equipment will generate increased revenues in line with our projections or that we will not lose more customers than we expect. Assuming that the retained revenues are in line with our estimate, we project that
the net savings from the 2002 restructuring will increase our annual operating income by about $20 million.



The table
below provides certain information concerning our restructuring charges. For additional information, see Note 5 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.

(1)

Represents the cash component of the 2001 charge that had not been paid as of December 31, 2001.

(2)

Represents (i) the non-cash component of the 2002 charge that relates to the elements of the 2002 restructuring plan that were implemented through the end of 2002
and (ii) the cash components of the 2001 and 2002 charges that were paid in 2002.

(3)

Represents (i) the non-cash component of the 2002 charge that relates to the elements of the 2002 restructuring plan that will be implemented after 2002 and (ii) the
cash components of the 2001 and 2002 charges that were not paid as of December 31, 2002.

(4)

These costs primarily represent (i) payment of obligations under leases offset by estimated sublease opportunities, (ii) the write-off of capital improvements made
to such facilities and (iii) the write-off of related goodwill (only in 2001).

(5)

These costs primarily represent severance.

(6)

These costs primarily represent the abandonment of certain information technology projects and the payment of obligations under equipment leases relating to such
projects.

As indicated in table
above, the aggregate balance of the 2001 and 2002 charges was $27.1 million as of December 31, 2002. We estimate that approximately $13.4 million of the remaining 2001 and 2002 charges will be incurred by December 31, 2003 (comprised of
approximately $12.4 million of the cash component and approximately $1.0 million of the non-cash component) and approximately $13.7 million in future periods. These payments will not affect our future earnings because the charges associated with
these payments have already been recorded in our 2002 or 2001 results. We expect to make these payments with cash from our operations.

Debt Refinancings and Extraordinary Item

We refinanced approximately $199.4 million of indebtedness in December 2002. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a $1.6
million charge ($0.9 million, net of tax) for the write-off of deferred financing fees attributable to the debt that was refinanced. For additional information concerning this transaction, see “—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Financing Transaction in 2002.”

We refinanced an aggregate of $1,695.7 million of indebtedness and other obligations in April 2001. In connection with this transaction, we recorded the following charges: (i) a pre-tax extraordinary charge of $18.1 million ($11.3
million, net of tax) that relates to the refinancing of indebtedness and primarily reflects the write-off of deferred financing fees attributable to the debt that was refinanced and (ii) a pre-tax charge of $7.8 million ($5.2 million, net of tax)
that is recorded in other (income) expense, net, and relates to the refinancing of a synthetic lease.

Results of Operations

Overview of 2002 Results

Our results in 2002 were hurt by the $505.4 million of after-tax charges for non-cash goodwill write-offs and restructuring and refinancing costs described above. These charges are the reason that we ended the year with a net loss of
$397.8 million.



If you exclude
the charges described above in both 2002 and 2001, then we would have had income, as adjusted, of $107.6 million in 2002, representing a 26.8% decrease from $147.0 million in 2001. The table below reconciles our net income (loss) to our income, as
adjusted, to exclude specified charges. We provide this as adjusted data because we believe that an analysis of such data, in conjunction with an analysis of the GAAP data, may be useful to investors in understanding our 2002 results.

Private
non-residential construction declined by 16% in 2002, according to Department of Commerce data. This reduced demand for our equipment and put downward pressure on rental rates and on used equipment prices. Our rental rates were down 4.8% and 5.2%
for full-year and fourth-quarter 2002, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The decrease in rental rates was partially offset by a 2.1% increase in the volume of rental transactions at locations open more than one year and by revenues
attributable to new locations, partially offset by locations closed or consolidated. The net effect was that our total revenues for the year decreased 2.2% to $2,821.0 million and our same-store rental revenues decreased 2.7%.

The decrease in rental rates and used equipment prices and, to
a lesser extent, increases in certain operating costs hurt our gross profit margins. Our gross profit margin from rentals decreased to 32.1% in 2002 from 37.9% in 2001, and our gross profit margin from sales of used rental equipment decreased to
33.7% in 2002 from 39.7% in 2001. On an overall basis our gross profit margin declined to 31.4% in 2002 from 36.0% in 2001.

Our lower revenues and gross profit margins in 2002 are the principal factors that caused income, as adjusted, to decrease to $107.6 in
2002 from $147.0 in 2001. These negative factors were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 as described above, which added approximately $36.6 million to our 2002 income, as adjusted.

While income was down in 2002, we maintained ample liquidity.
We generated cash flow of $694.1 million, which included $517.9 million from operations and the balance from the sale of used rental equipment. We used $492.3 million of this cash to invest in our rental fleet. At year-end, we had $45.3 million
drawn under our revolving credit facility, leaving us with $493.1 million of available borrowing capacity on this facility after taking into account letters of credit.



Additional Information

Years Ended December 31, 2002 and

Revenues

.    We had total revenues of $2,821.0 million in 2002, representing a decrease of 2.2% from total revenues of $2,886.6 million in 2001. The different components of our revenues are discussed below:

1.

Equipment
Rentals.

Our revenues from equipment rentals were $2,154.7 million in 2002, representing a decrease of 2.6% from $2,212.9 million in 2001. These revenues accounted for 76.4% of our total revenues in 2002 compared with
76.7% of our total revenues in 2001. The decrease in rental revenues principally reflected the following:

•

Our rental revenues from locations open more than one year, or same store rental revenues, decreased by approximately 2.7%. This decrease reflected a decrease in
rental rates, which was partially offset by a 2.1% increase in the volume of rental transactions. The decrease in rental rates was 4.8% for full year 2002 and 5.2% for the fourth quarter of 2002 on a year-over-year basis. The decrease in rental
rates principally reflected continued weakness in non-residential construction spending.

•

The decrease in same store rental revenues was partially offset by additional revenues attributable to new locations that we acquired or opened. These additional
revenues, net of revenues lost due to locations sold or closed, caused our overall decline in rental revenues to be 0.1 percentage points less than it would otherwise have been.

2.

Sales of Rental
Equipment.

Our revenues from the sale of rental equipment were $176.2 million in 2002, representing an increase of 19.8% from $147.1 million in 2001. These revenues accounted for 6.2% of our total revenues in 2002 compared
with 5.1% of our total revenues in 2001. The increase in these revenues in 2002 reflected an increase in volume partially offset by weaker pricing.

3.

Sales of Equipment and Merchandise and Other Revenues.

Our revenues from “sale of
equipment and merchandise and other revenues” were $490.1 million in 2002, representing a decrease of 6.9% from $526.6 million in 2001. These revenues accounted for 17.4% of our total revenues in 2002 compared with 18.2% of our total revenues
in 2001. The decrease in these revenues in 2002 principally reflected a decrease in the volume of new equipment sales.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit decreased to $886.3 million in 2002 from $1,039.5 million in 2001. This decrease
reflected the decrease in total revenues discussed above, as well as the decrease in gross profit margin described below from equipment rental and the sale of rental equipment. Information concerning our gross profit margin by source of revenue is
set forth below:

1.

Equipment
Rentals.

Our gross profit margin from equipment rental revenues was 32.1% in 2002 and 37.9% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 principally reflected the decrease in rental rates described above and, to a lesser extent, higher
costs related to employee benefits, fleet maintenance and delivery, and facilities.

2.

Sales of Rental Equipment.

Our gross profit margin from sales of rental equipment was 33.7% in 2002 and 39.7% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 primarily
reflected continued price weakness in the used equipment market.

3.

Sales of Equipment and Merchandise and Other Revenues.

Our gross profit margin from “sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” was 27.6% in 2002 and 27.1% in 2001.
The increase in the gross profit margin in 2002 primarily reflected better margins for our service revenue.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

.    Selling, general and administrative expenses
(“SG&A”) were $438.9 million, or 15.6% of total revenues, during 2002 and $441.8 million, or 15.3% of total revenues,



during 2001. Our bad debt expense, which is a component of SG&A, was approximately $9.5 million higher in 2002 than in 2001, primarily
reflecting an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Without this increase in bad debt expense, our SG&A as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to 15.2% of total revenues in 2002 from 15.6% in 2001. This decrease in SG&A,
excluding the change in bad debt expense, primarily reflected our ongoing efforts at cutting costs, including reducing the number of administrative personnel, reducing discretionary expenditures and consolidating certain credit and collection
facilities.

Goodwill
Impairment

.

We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $247.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. See “—Change in Accounting Treatment for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for
additional information.

Restructuring
Charge

.

We recorded a restructuring charge of $28.3 million in 2002 and $28.9 million in 2001. See “—Restructuring Plans in 2002 and 2001” for additional information.

Non-rental Depreciation and
Amortization

.    Non-rental depreciation and amortization was $59.3 million, or 2.1% of total revenues, in 2002 and $106.8 million, or 3.7% of total revenues, in 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to a new
accounting standard (discussed above under “—Change in Accounting Treatment For Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”) which eliminated the amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002. If goodwill amortization had been
eliminated in 2001, then non-rental depreciation and amortization would have been $48.5 million, or 1.7% of total revenues, in 2001. The increase in non-rental depreciation and amortization in 2002 as compared to the amount in 2001, after
eliminating goodwill amortization, primarily reflected an increase in our non-rental assets such as facilities and transportation equipment.

Operating Income.

We recorded operating income of $111.9 million in 2002 compared with operating income of
$462.0 million in 2001. The principal reason for the decrease in 2002 was the $247.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in 2002. However, after excluding that charge our operating income was still lower by approximately
$102.2 million from the 2001 level. The principal reason for this decrease was the declines in revenues and gross profit described above. The adverse effects of these factors were partially offset by the decrease in non-rental depreciation and
amortization described above.

Interest
Expense

.    Interest expense decreased to $196.0 million in 2002 from $221.6 million in 2001. This decrease primarily reflected lower interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Preferred Dividends of a Subsidiary
Trust

.    Preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust were $18.2 million during 2002 as compared to $19.5 million during 2001. The decrease in 2002 reflects our repurchase of a portion of our outstanding trust preferred
securities.

Other (Income)
Expense

.    Other income was $0.9 million in 2002 compared with other expense of $6.4 million in 2001. The other income in 2002 was primarily attributable to the favorable settlement of a lawsuit for net proceeds of $4.0
million, partially offset by other charges including the write-off of $1.6 million of deferred financing fees as described above. The other expense in 2001 was primarily attributable to a $7.8 million charge relating to the refinancing of a
synthetic lease as described above. See “—Debt Refinancings and Extraordinary Item.”

Income Taxes

.    Income taxes were $8.1 million in 2002 compared with $92.0 million in 2001. Although we had a
loss in 2002, we recorded income tax expense because a portion of our $247.9 million goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for federal income tax purposes. If you exclude the goodwill impairment charge in calculating our income, then our
effective tax rate in 2002 would have been 39.0% compared with 42.9% in 2001. The decrease in such effective rate in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 and the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of certain costs
included in the 2001 restructuring charge.

Income (Loss) Before Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle.

We had a loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $109.5
million in



2002 compared with income before extraordinary item of $122.6 million in 2001. The loss in 2002 principally reflects the decrease in
operating income described above.

Cumulative
Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

. As described under “—Change in Accounting Treatment for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we recorded an amount of $288.3 million, net of tax, for impairment of goodwill as part of
our transitional impairment test upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000

Revenues

.    We had total revenues of $2,886.6 million in 2001, representing a decrease of 1.1% from total revenues of $2,918.9 million in 2000. The different components of
our revenues are discussed below:

1.

Equipment Rentals.

Our revenues from equipment rentals were $2,212.9 million 2001, representing an increase of 7.6% from $2,056.7 million in 2000. These revenues accounted for 76.7% of our
total revenues in 2001 compared with 70.5% of our total revenues in 2000. The increase in rental revenues reflected the following:

•

We increased our revenues at locations open more than one year. This increase accounted for approximately 5.6 percentage points of the total increase of 7.6%. The
increase in revenues at these locations was due to an increase in the volume of transactions, which was more than sufficient to offset a decline in rental rates. Rental rates for 2001 were down 0.8% compared to 2000.

•

We also had additional revenues because we added new rental locations through start-ups and acquisitions. These additional revenues, net of revenues lost due to
locations sold or closed, accounted for approximately 2.0 percentage points of the total increase of 7.6%.

2.

Sales of Rental Equipment.

Our revenues from the sale of rental equipment were $147.1 million
in 2001, representing a decrease of 57.7% from $347.7 million in 2000. These revenues accounted for 5.1% of our total revenues in 2001 compared with 11.9% of our total revenues in 2000. This decrease principally reflected our decision to slow
investment in new equipment and hold existing equipment longer during a recessionary environment.

3.

Sales of Equipment and Merchandise and Other Revenues.

Our revenues from “sale of
equipment and merchandise and other revenues” were $526.6 million in 2001, representing an increase of 2.4% from $514.5 million in 2000. These revenues accounted for 18.2% of our total revenues in 2001 compared with 17.6% of our total revenues
in 2000. The 2.4% increase in sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues was attributable to the increase in the volume of transactions.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit decreased to $1,039.5 million in 2001 from $1,088.6 million in 2000. This
decrease reflected the decrease in total revenues discussed above, as well as the decrease in gross profit margin described below from equipment rental and the sales of rental equipment. Information concerning our gross profit margin by source of
revenue is set forth below:

1.

Equipment Rentals.

Our gross profit margin from equipment rental revenues was 37.9% in 2001 and 39.9% in 2000. The decrease in 2001 principally reflected: (i) an increase in our cost of
equipment rental, which was principally attributable to an increase in the amount of equipment that we hold under operating leases rather than owning, and (ii) the decrease in rental rates described above.

2.

Sales of Rental
Equipment.

Our gross profit margin from the sales of rental equipment was 39.7% in 2001 and 40.1% in 2000. This decrease was primarily the result of modest price declines in some geographic areas.

3.

Sales of Equipment and Merchandise and Other
Revenues.

Our gross profit margin from “sales of equipment and merchandise and other revenues” was 27.1% in 2001 and 24.9% in 2000. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2001 primarily reflected: (i) lower
costs resulting from our ongoing efforts to consolidate



our suppliers and further capitalize on our purchasing power and (ii) a shift in mix which resulted in more of our sales being attributable
to higher margin areas such as providing services and merchandise sales.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

.    SG&A was $441.8 million, or 15.3% of total revenues, during 2001 and $454.3 million, or 15.6% of total revenues, during 2000. The decrease in
SG&A in 2001 primarily reflected cost-cutting measures that we have taken, including reducing the number of administrative personnel, reducing discretionary expenditures and consolidating certain credit and collection facilities.

Restructuring
Charge

.

We recorded a restructuring charge of $28.9 million in 2001. See “—Restructuring Plans in 2001 and 2002” for additional information.

Non-rental Depreciation and
Amortization

.    Non-rental depreciation and amortization was $106.8 million, or 3.7% of total revenues, in 2001 and $86.3 million, or 3.0% of total revenues, in 2000. The increase in the dollar amount of non-rental
depreciation and amortization in 2001 primarily reflected (i) the amortization of goodwill attributable to acquisitions completed during 2000 and (ii) additional non-rental vehicles which generally have shorter useful lives.

Operating Income.

We recorded
operating income of $462.0 million in 2001 compared with operating income of $547.9 million in 2000. The principal reason for the decrease in 2001 was the $28.9 million restructuring charge and the decrease in revenues from the sale of rental
equipment described above.

Interest
Expense

.    Interest expense decreased to $221.6 million in 2001 from $228.8 million in 2000. This decrease primarily reflected lower interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Preferred Dividends of a Subsidiary
Trust

.    During 2001 and 2000, preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust were $19.5 million.

Other (Income) Expense

.    Other expense was $6.4 million in 2001 compared with other income of $1.8 million in
2000. The increase in other expense in 2001 was primarily attributable to the $7.8 million charge we incurred relating to the refinancing costs of a synthetic lease as described under “—Debt Refinancings and Extraordinary Item.”

Income
Taxes

.    Income taxes were $92.0 million, or an effective rate of 42.9%, in 2001 compared to $125.1 million, or an effective rate of 41.5%, in 2000. The increase in the effective rate in 2001 was primarily attributable to
the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of certain costs included in the restructuring charge.

Income Before Extraordinary Item.

We had income before extraordinary item of $122.6 million in 2001 compared
with income before extraordinary item of $176.4 million in 2000. The decrease in 2001 principally reflected the decrease in operating income and the $6.4 million of other expense described above.

Extraordinary Item

.    We recorded
an extraordinary charge of $18.1 million ($11.3 million, net of tax) in 2001. See “—Debt Refinancings and Extraordinary Item” for additional information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Financing Transaction in 2002

In December 2002, we sold $210.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 10 ¾% Senior Notes Due 2008.
The gross proceeds to us from the sale of the notes were approximately $203.8 million and the net proceeds were approximately $199.4 million (after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses). These new notes are unsecured
and were issued by United Rentals (North America), Inc. (“URI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of United Rentals, Inc. (“Holdings”) and are guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to limited exceptions, our domestic subsidiaries. We used
the net proceeds to (i) permanently repay approximately



$99.7 million of outstanding indebtedness under our existing term loan and (ii) repay approximately $99.7 million of outstanding borrowings
under our revolving credit facility. For additional information concerning this transaction, see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

In connection with the offering of the notes, we amended the agreement governing our existing term loan and
revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) provide us with greater flexibility in maintaining or satisfying certain financial ratios and tests required thereunder through the end of 2004 and (ii) reduce the maximum borrowing available
under our revolving credit facility from $750 million to $650 million.

Certain Balance Sheet Changes

The decrease in goodwill at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to the write-offs of goodwill as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 as further described under “—Change in
Accounting Treatment for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The decrease in deferred taxes at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to the tax effects of the goodwill write-off and the exercise of
stock options in 2002. The decrease in retained earnings and stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001, reflects our net loss in 2002. The increase in additional paid-in capital at December 31, 2002 as compared
to December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to: (i) the issuance of additional shares upon the exercise of stock options and restricted stock, partially offset by common stock repurchased and retired, and (ii) the repurchase of 1,469,000 shares
of our Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities at a price less than their liquidation preference.

Sources and Uses of Cash

During 2002, we (i) generated cash from operations of $517.9 million, (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental equipment of $176.2
million, (iii) received cash of $63.8 million from the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options and (iv) obtained cash from borrowings, net of repayments, of approximately $16.6 million. We used cash during this period principally
to (i) pay consideration for acquisitions ($172.6 million), (ii) purchase rental equipment ($492.3 million), (iii) purchase other property and equipment ($38.6 million), (iv) purchase and retire shares of our outstanding common stock ($26.7
million), and (v) repurchase and retire shares of our convertible preferred securities ($38.1 million).

Certain Information Concerning Our Credit Facility

Our revolving credit facility enables United Rentals (North America), Inc. (“URI”), our wholly owned subsidiary, to borrow up to
$650 million on a revolving basis and enables one of URI’s Canadian subsidiaries to borrow up to $50 million (provided that the aggregate borrowings of URI and the Canadian subsidiary may not exceed $650 million). Up to $175 million of the
revolving credit facility is available in the form of letters of credit. The revolving credit facility will mature and terminate on October 20, 2006.

As of December 31, 2002, borrowings under the revolving credit facility by URI accrue interest, at our option, at either (A) the ABR Rate
(which is equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the Chase Manhattan Bank’s prime rate) plus a margin of 1.50% or (B) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.50%. The above interest rate margins are adjusted
quarterly based on our financial leverage ratio, up to maximum margins of 1.75% and 2.75%, for revolving loans based on the ABR rate and the adjusted LIBOR rate, respectively, and down to minimum margins of 0.75% and 1.75%, for revolving loans based
on the ABR rate and the adjusted LIBOR rate, respectively. If at any time an event of default exists, the interest rate applicable to each loan will increase by 2% per annum. We are also required to pay the lenders a commitment fee equal to 0.5% per
annum in respect of undrawn commitments under the revolving credit facility.

Certain Information Concerning Receivables Securitization

We have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which one of our subsidiaries can borrow up to $250 million against a collateral pool of accounts receivable. The borrowings under the
facility and the



receivables in the collateral pool are included in the liabilities and assets, respectively, reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Key
terms of this facility include:

•

borrowings may be made only to the extent that the face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool exceeds the outstanding loans by a specified amount;

•

the facility is structured so that the receivables in the collateral pool are the lenders’ only source of repayment;

•

prior to expiration or early termination of the facility, amounts collected on the receivables may, subject to certain conditions, be retained by the borrower,
provided that the remaining receivables in the collateral pool are sufficient to secure the then outstanding borrowings; and

•

after expiration or early termination of the facility, we will repay the borrowings

As of December 31, 2002, (i) the outstanding borrowings under the facility were approximately $160.5 million
and (ii) the aggregate face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool was approximately $346.8 million. The agreement governing this facility, which was amended in June 2001, contemplates that the term of the facility may extend for up to
three years from the date of the amended facility. However, on each anniversary of such date, the consent of the lender is required for the facility to renew for the next year. The next anniversary date is in June 2003. We plan to seek the
lenders’ approval for renewal or, alternatively, seek to obtain a new facility. The lenders under this facility may, at their option, terminate the facility in the event that our long-term senior secured debt securities are at any time rated
“B+” or below by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or “B1” or below by Moody’s Investor Service.

Cash Requirements Related to Operations

Our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available
under our revolving credit facility. As of March 11, 2003, we had $459.1 million of borrowing capacity available under our $650 million revolving credit facility (reflecting outstanding loans of approximately $48.1 million and outstanding letters of
credit in the amount of approximately $142.8 million). We believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months.

We expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next 12 months will
be to fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale, (iii) payments due under operating leases, (iv) debt service, and (v) costs relating to our restructuring plans. We
plan to fund such cash requirements relating to our existing operations from our existing sources of cash described above. In addition, we plan to seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment. For information on the
scheduled principal payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases, see “—Certain Information Concerning Contractual Obligations.”

The amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a
number of factors, including general economic conditions and growth prospects. Based on current conditions, we estimate that capital expenditures for the year 2003 will be approximately $350 million for our existing operations. These expenditures
are comprised of approximately $300 million of expenditures to replace rental equipment sold and $50 million of expenditures for the purchase of non-rental equipment. We expect that we will fund such expenditures from proceeds from the sale of used
equipment, cash generated from operations and, if required, borrowings available under our revolving credit facility.

We plan to increase the weighted average age of our fleet, which is approximately 36 months, to 42 months by the end of 2003. Over the
longer term we may further increase the average age of our fleet to about 45 months. This plan reflects our belief that the optimum age of our fleet is somewhat higher than where it is today. In estimating the optimum age of our fleet, we have
taken into account a number of factors, including our current estimates regarding the relationship between age and reliability and maintenance costs and the capital



expenditures required to maintain the fleet at a particular age. We will continue to evaluate these factors and, if our estimates prove
inaccurate, may modify our plan.

While
emphasizing internal growth, we may also continue to expand through a disciplined acquisition program. We will consider potential transactions of varying size and may, on a selective basis, pursue acquisition or consolidation opportunities involving
other public companies or large privately-held companies. We expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash, capital stock, notes and/or assumption of indebtedness. To the extent that our existing sources of cash described above are not sufficient
to fund such future acquisitions, we will require additional debt or equity financing and, consequently, our indebtedness may increase or the ownership of existing stockholders may be diluted as we implement our growth strategy.

Certain Information Concerning Contractual Obligations

The table below provides certain information concerning the
payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations:

(1)

The payments due with respect to a period represent (i) in the case of debt and capital leases, the scheduled principal payments due in such period, and (ii) in the
case of operating leases, the minimum lease payments due in such period under non-cancelable operating leases.

(2)

Includes $160.5 million that is payable should our accounts receivable securitization facility terminate in 2003. As described under “—Certain Information
Concerning Receivables Securitization,” subject to the lenders’ consent being obtained, the term of this facility may be extended. Extension of the facility in 2003 would reduce the debt payable in 2003 from $163.3 million to $2.8 million
and increase by a corresponding amount the debt payable in the year during which the extended facility terminates.

Certain Information Concerning Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Restricted Stock.

We have granted to employees other than executive officers
and directors approximately 1,165,000 shares of restricted stock that contain the following provisions. The shares vest in 2004, 2005 or 2006 or earlier upon a change in control of the Company, death, disability, retirement or certain terminations
of employment, and are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting on certain other terminations of employment, the violation of non-compete provisions and certain other events. The grants provide that we will pay to employees who vest in their
restricted stock, and who sell their restricted stock within five trading days after vesting, a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of: (i) approximately $300,000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales are less
than $27.26 but more than $15.17; (ii) a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of approximately $500,000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales



are less than $15.17 but more than $9.18; and (iii) a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of approximately $1,165,000 for each
dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales are less than $9.18.

Operating Leases.

We lease real estate, rental equipment and non-rental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity. As part of many of our equipment
operating leases, we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value. The use of these guarantees helps to lower our monthly operating lease payments. We believe that the
projected residual values are reasonable and, accordingly, that we are not likely to incur material obligations pursuant to such guarantees. However, we cannot be certain that the actual residual values will not turn out to be significantly below
the projected values that we guaranteed. Our maximum potential liability under these guarantees is $231.6 million, which represents the aggregate amount that we would be required to pay if the residual value was zero for all equipment subject to
such guarantees. In conformity with applicable accounting standards, this potential liability is not recorded on our balance sheet. For additional information concerning lease payment obligations under our operating leases, see “—Certain
Information Concerning Contractual Obligations” and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.

Certain Information Concerning Trust Preferred Securities

In August 1998, a subsidiary trust of United Rentals, Inc. sold six million shares of 6½% Convertible
Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”) for aggregate consideration of $300 million. During 2002, we repurchased 1,469,000 of these shares for aggregate consideration of approximately $38.1 million, which
represents a discount of approximately 48% relative to the aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $73.5 million.

Relationship Between Holdings and URI

United Rentals, Inc. (“Holdings”) is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly
owned subsidiary United Rentals (North America), Inc. (“URI”) and subsidiaries of URI. Holdings provides certain services to URI in connection with its operations. These services principally include: (i) senior management services, (ii)
finance related services and support, (iii) information technology systems and support, and (iv) acquisition related services. In addition, Holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by URI and its
subsidiaries. URI has made, and expects to continue to make, certain payments to Holdings in respect of the services provided by Holdings to URI. The expenses relating to URI’s payments to Holdings are reflected on URI’s financial
statements as selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, although not legally obligated to do so, URI has in the past, and expects that it will in the future, make distributions to Holdings to, among other things, enable Holdings to
pay dividends on the Trust Preferred Securities that were issued by a subsidiary trust of Holdings as described above.

The Trust Preferred Securities are the obligation of a subsidiary trust of Holdings and are not the obligation of URI. As a result, the
dividends payable on these securities are reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of Holdings, but are not reflected as an expense on the consolidated financial statements of URI. This is the principal reason why the net
income reported on the consolidated financial statements of URI is higher than the net income reported on the consolidated financial statements of Holdings.

Fluctuations in Operating Results

We expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term. Certain of the general
factors that may cause such fluctuations are discussed under “—Factors that May Influence Future Results and Accuracy of Forward Looking Statements—Fluctuations of Operating Results.”

Accounting For Certain Expenses Relating to Potential Acquisitions

In accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, we capitalize certain direct out-of-pocket expenditures (such as legal and accounting fees) relating to potential or pending acquisitions.



Indirect acquisition costs, such as executive salaries, general corporate overhead, public affairs and other corporate services, are expensed
as incurred. Our policy is to charge against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to any potential or pending acquisition that we determine will not be consummated. There can be no assurance that in future periods we will not be required
to incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy, which charge, depending upon the magnitude thereof, could adversely affect our results of operations.

Seasonality

Our business is seasonal with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months. The seasonality of our business is
heightened because we offer for rent traffic control equipment. Branches that rent a significant amount of this type of equipment tend to generate most of their revenues and profits in the second and third quarters of the year, slow down during the
fourth quarter and operate at a loss during the first quarter.

Inflation

Although we
cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations, we believe that inflation has not had, and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have, a material impact on our results of operations.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” effective January 1, 2002. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill
and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, “Intangible Assets.” Under this standard, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment
tests on a reporting unit level. For additional information, see “-Change in Accounting Treatment For Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Other intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of”. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission
of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”. This standard rescinds SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt”, and an amendment of that Statement,
SFAS No. 64, “Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements”. This standard also rescinds SFAS No. 44, “Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers”. This standard amends SFAS No. 13, “Accounting
for Leases”, to eliminate an inconsistency related to the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and certain lease modifications. This standard also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical
corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2003, and we will reclassify a pre-tax extraordinary loss of approximately $18.1 million recognized during the second
quarter of 2001 to operating income. The adoption of the remaining provisions of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. This standard nullifies EITF Issue



No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs
Incurred in a Restructuring)”. This standard is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. This interpretation requires certain guarantees entered into after December 31, 2002 to be initially recognized and recorded at fair value and also requires new disclosures related to
guarantees even if the likelihood of a guarantor having to make payments under the guarantees is remote. We adopted this interpretation as of December 31, 2002 and such adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

In December 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure”. This standard provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” but does not require us to use the fair value method. This standard also amends certain disclosure requirements related to stock-based employee compensation. We adopted the
disclosure portion of this standard as of December 31, 2002 and such adoption is reflected in Note 2 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Factors that May Influence Future Results and Accuracy of Forward-Looking Statements

Sensitivity to Changes in Construction and Industrial Activities

Our equipment is principally used in connection with
construction and industrial activities. Consequently, decreases in construction or industrial activity due to a recession or other reasons may lead to a decrease in the demand for our equipment or the prices that we can charge. Any such decrease
could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. For example, as discussed above, our 2002 revenues, pricing and operating results were adversely affected by a significant decline in non-residential construction activity.

We have identified below certain factors that may cause a
further downturn in construction and industrial activity, either temporarily or long-term:

•

a continuation or a worsening of the current recessionary environment;

•

an increase in interest rates;

•

adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular region; or

•

terrorism or hostilities involving the United States.

In addition, demand for our equipment may not reach projected levels in the event that funding for highway and other construction projects
under government programs is reduced.

Fluctuations of
Operating Results

We expect that our
revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors. These factors include:

•

seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter;

•

completion of acquisitions;

•

changes in the amount of revenue relating to renting traffic control equipment, since revenues from this equipment category tend to be more seasonal than the rest of
our business;

•

changes in the size of our rental fleet or in the rate at which we sell our used equipment;



•

changes in demand for our equipment or the prices therefor due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors;

•

changes in the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt;

•

increases in the cost of fuel due to the current military conflict or other factors;

•

if we determine that a potential acquisition will not be consummated, the need to charge against earnings any expenditures relating to such transaction (such as
financing commitment fees, merger and acquisition advisory fees and professional fees) previously capitalized;

•

the possible need, from time to time, to take goodwill write-offs as described below or other write-offs or special charges due to a variety of occurrences such as
the adoption of new accounting standards, store consolidations or closings or the refinancing of existing indebtedness.

Substantial Goodwill

At December 31, 2002, we had on our balance sheet net goodwill in the amount of $1,705.2 million, which represented approximately 36.4% of
our total assets at such date. This goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that we paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the net assets of those businesses. We are required to test our
goodwill for impairment at least annually. In general, this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill, calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards, is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our
balance sheet. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value, we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense. Any write-off would adversely affect our results, as was the case in 2002 as described above.

We test for goodwill impairment on a
branch-by-branch basis rather than on an aggregate basis. This means that a goodwill write-off is required even if only one or a limited number of our branches has impairment and even if there is no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate
basis. Factors that may cause future impairment at a particular branch, in addition to macro economic factors that affect all our branches, include changes in local demand and local competitive conditions. The fact that we test for impairment on a
branch-by-branch basis increases the likelihood that we will be required to take additional non-cash goodwill write-offs in the future, although we cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future write-off.

Substantial Indebtedness

At December 31, 2002, our total indebtedness was
approximately $2,512.8 million. Our substantial indebtedness has the potential to affect us adversely in a number of ways. For example, it will or could:

•

require us to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt service, reducing the funds available for other purposes;

•

constrain our ability to obtain additional financing, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing
indebtedness; or

•

make it difficult for us to cope with a downturn in our business or a decrease in our cash flow.

Furthermore, if we are unable to service our indebtedness and
fund our business, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include:

•

reducing or delaying capital expenditures;

•

limiting our growth;

•

seeking additional capital;

•

selling assets; or

•

restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness.



We cannot be
sure that any of these strategies could be effected on favorable terms or at all.

A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense
and our debt service obligations. At December 31, 2002, we had $844.9 million of variable rate indebtedness.

Need to Satisfy Financial and Other Covenants in Debt Agreements

Under the agreements governing our credit facility and our term loan, we are required to, among other things, satisfy certain financial
tests relating to: (a) minimum interest coverage ratio, (b) the ratio of funded debt to cash flow, (c) the ratio of senior debt to tangible assets and (d) the ratio of senior debt to cash flow. If we are unable to satisfy any of these covenants, the
lenders could elect to terminate the credit facility and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and our term loan. In such event, unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the revolving
credit facility, we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above. We cannot be sure that any alternative strategy could be effected on favorable terms or at all.

We are also subject to various other covenants
under the agreements governing our credit facility, term loan and other indebtedness. These covenants limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, make prepayments of certain indebtedness, pay dividends, make
investments, create liens, make acquisitions, sell assets and engage in mergers and acquisitions. These covenants could adversely affect our business by significantly limiting our operating and financial flexibility.

Dependence on Additional Capital

If the cash that we generate from our business, together with
cash that we may borrow under our credit facility, is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing. We cannot, however, be certain that any additional financing will be available or, if
available, will be available on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business, including those
relating to purchasing equipment, making acquisitions, opening new rental locations and refinancing existing indebtedness.

Certain Risks Relating to Acquisitions

We have grown in part through acquisitions and may continue to do so. The making of acquisitions entails certain risks, including:

•

unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations;

•

difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company with our existing operations or in maintaining uniform standards; and

•

loss of key employees of the acquired company.

We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will not be harmed as
a result of acquisitions.

Dependence on Management

Our success is highly dependent on the
experience and skills of our senior management team. If we lose the services of any member of this team and are unable to find a suitable replacement, we may not have the depth of senior management resources required to efficiently manage our
business and execute our strategy. We do not maintain “key man” life insurance on the lives of members of senior management.



Competition

The equipment rental industry is highly
fragmented and competitive. Our competitors primarily include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations, regional competitors which operate in one or more states, public companies or divisions of public companies, and equipment
vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and
operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing the prices that we can charge.

Dependence on Information Technology Systems

Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions.
Any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our
operations and adjust to changing market conditions.

Liability and Insurance

We are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business. These possible claims include those relating to (1) personal injury or death caused by equipment rented or sold by us, (2) motor vehicle accidents involving our
delivery and service personnel and (3) employment related claims. We carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations. However, such insurance may not fully protect us for a number of reasons, including:

•

our coverage is subject to deductibles of $2 million for general liability and $3 million for automobile liability and limited to a maximum of $100 million per
occurrence;

•

we do not maintain coverage for environmental liability (other than legally required fuel storage tank coverage), since we believe that the cost for such coverage is
high relative to the benefit that it provides; and

•

certain types of claims, such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct, which are often alleged in third party lawsuits,
might not be covered by our insurance.

If we are
found liable for any significant claims that are not covered by insurance, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, if at all.

Environmental and Safety Regulations

Our operations are subject to numerous laws governing
environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous wastes and materials, and air quality. Under these laws, we may be liable for, among other things,
(1) the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and (2) fines and penalties for non-compliance. Our operations generally do
not raise significant environmental risks, but we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment, and dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from underground and
above-ground storage tanks located at certain of our locations.

Based on the conditions currently known to us, we do not believe that any pending or likely remediation and compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be certain, however, as to the potential
financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered or environmental and safety requirements become more stringent. If we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently
anticipated by us, our business could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost.



Labor Matters

We have 1,063 employees that are
represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. If we should experience a prolonged labor dispute involving a significant number of our employees, our ability to serve our customers could be adversely affected. Furthermore,
our labor costs could increase as a result of the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes.

Operations Outside the United States

Our operations in Canada and Mexico are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (1) the need
to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates, (2) the need to comply with foreign laws and (3) the possibility of political or economic instability in foreign countries.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk primarily consists of (1) interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and (2) foreign currency
exchange rate risk primarily associated with our Canadian operations.

Interest Rate Risk.

We periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2002, we had interest rate protection
in the form of swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million. The effect of some of these agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to 9.5% on $200.0 million of our term loan. The effect of the remainder of these
agreements is to convert $300.0 million of our fixed rate 9


/


% Notes to a floating rate instrument through
2009.

We have the following indebtedness
that bears interest at a variable rate: (i) all borrowings under our $650 million revolving credit facility ($45.3 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002), (ii) our term loan ($639.0 million remaining outstanding as of December 31, 2002), and
(iii) all borrowings under our $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility ($160.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002). The weighted average interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt as of December 31, 2002 were (i)
5.3% for the revolving credit facility, (ii) 4.8% for the term loan, and (iii) 2.2% for the receivables securitization facility. Based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, taking into account our interest rate swap agreements, as of
December 31, 2002 (approximately $944.9 million in the aggregate), our earnings would decrease by approximately $5.8 million for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt. The amount of our
variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility from time to time. For additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt,
see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.

Currency Exchange Risk.

The functional currency for our Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. As a result, our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in
the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. Based upon the level of our Canadian operations during 2002 relative to the company as a whole, a 10% change in this exchange rate would have caused our earnings to change by approximately
$1.8 million. In addition, we periodically enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our transaction exposures. At December 31, 2002, we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts. We do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts
for speculative purposes.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors

United Rentals, Inc.

UNITED
RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Organization and Basis of Presentation

United Rentals, Inc. (“Holdings”) is principally a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary United Rentals (North America), Inc.
(“URI”) and subsidiaries of URI. Holdings was incorporated in July 1998 and became the parent of URI on August 5, 1998, pursuant to the reorganization of the legal structure of URI. Prior to such reorganization, the name of URI was United
Rentals, Inc. References herein to the “Company” refer to Holdings and its subsidiaries, with respect to periods following the reorganization, and to URI and its subsidiaries, with respect to periods prior to the reorganization. As a
result of the reorganization, Holdings’ primary asset is its sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of URI. URI’s various credit agreements and debt instruments place restrictions on its ability to transfer
funds to its shareholder.

The Company rents a
broad array of equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and others in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition to renting equipment, the
Company sells used rental equipment, acts as a dealer for new equipment and sells related merchandise, parts and service. The nature of the Company’s business is such that short-term obligations are typically met by cash flow generated from
long-term assets. Therefore, the accompanying balance sheets are presented on an unclassified basis.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, giving
retroactive effect for the reorganization for all periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts.
This allowance reflects the Company’s estimate of the amount of its receivables that it will be unable to collect.

Inventory

Inventory consists of equipment, tools, parts, fuel and related supply items. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is
net of a reserve for obsolescence and shrinkage of $6.5 million and $9.4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cost is determined on either a weighted average or first-in, first-out method.

Rental Equipment

Rental equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of the equipment using the straight-line method. The range of estimated useful lives for rental equipment is two to ten years. Rental equipment is depreciated to a salvage value of zero to ten percent of cost. Ordinary repair
and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred.



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost
and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The range of estimated useful lives for property and equipment is two to thirty-nine years. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as
incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or the remaining life of the lease, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill

Goodwill consists of the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a
straight-line basis over forty years. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is tested on at least an annual basis for impairment, see Note 4.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets consists of non-compete agreements.
The non-compete agreements are being amortized on a straight-line basis for periods ranging from three to eight years.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As part of an ongoing review of the valuation of long-lived
assets, the Company assesses the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired. If this review indicates that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, as determined by a nondiscounted cash
flow analysis over the remaining useful life, the carrying value would be reduced to its estimated fair value. There have been no material impairments recognized in these financial statements.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”, all derivatives are required to be recorded as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives are recognized immediately or deferred,
depending on the use of the derivative and whether or not it qualifies as a hedge. Derivative financial instruments are periodically used by the Company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivative financial
instruments are not used for trading purposes.

Translation of
Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities of
the Company’s subsidiaries operating outside the United States which account in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the year. Revenues and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates effective during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders’ equity.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the immediate to short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of the revolving credit facility, term loan, and
receivables securitization are determined using current interest rates for similar instruments as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and approximate the carrying value of these financial instruments due to the fact that the underlying instruments



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

include provisions to adjust interest rates to approximate fair market value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s other financial
instruments at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are based upon available market information and are as follows:

Preferred Stock

The Company issued Series A Perpetual
Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) and Series B Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”) in 1999 and included such preferred stock in stockholders’ equity. In July 2001, the SEC issued
guidance to all public companies as to when redeemable preferred stock may be classified as stockholders’ equity. This guidance indicates that preferred stock that would be subject to redemption on the occurrence of an event outside the control
of the issuer may not be classified as equity and that the probability of the event occurring is not a factor to be considered. Under this guidance, the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred would not be included in stockholders’ equity
because this stock would be subject to mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control. On September 28, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement effecting the exchange of new Series C Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C
Preferred”) for the Series A Preferred and new Series D Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series D Preferred”) for the Series B Preferred (see Note 11). The Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred stock is not subject to
mandatory redemption on a hostile change of control, and is classified as stockholders’ equity under the recently issued SEC guidance.

The effect of the foregoing is that the Company’s perpetual convertible preferred stock is classified as stockholders’ equity as
of September 28, 2001 and thereafter, but is classified outside of stockholders’ equity for earlier dates. Accordingly, the Company has restated the 2000 balance sheet to show its $430.8 million of perpetual convertible preferred stock under
“Series A and B Preferred Stock” rather than under “Stockholders’ Equity.” The Company has also made a corresponding change to the related Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. In all other respects, the
financial statements remain unchanged, including total assets and liabilities, revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue related to the sale of equipment and merchandise is recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer. Revenue
related to rental equipment is recognized over the contract term.

Advertising Expense

The
Company advertises primarily through trade publications and Yellow Pages. Advertising expense is recognized over the period of related benefit. Advertising expense was $7.8 million, $11.9 million and $23.8 million for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely than not realized in future periods.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates include restructuring
charges, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation, goodwill and other asset impairments, loss contingencies and fair values of financial instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Concentration of credit risk with respect to
accounts receivable is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base. The Company’s largest customer in 2002 represented approximately 1% of total revenues and no single customer
represented greater than 1% of total accounts receivable. The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. At December 31, 2002, the Company had six stock-based compensation plans (see Note 12). Since stock options are granted by the Company with
exercise prices at or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Restricted stock awards granted by the Company are recognized as deferred compensation. The Company recognizes compensation
expense related to these restricted stock awards over their vesting periods. The following table provides additional information related to the Company’s stock-based compensation arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
(in thousands):



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The weighted average fair value of options granted was $5.57, $7.34 and $7.70 during
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which uses subjective assumptions which can materially affect fair value estimates and, therefore, does not necessarily
provide a single measure of fair value of options. The Company used a risk-free interest rate average of 2.01%, 3.74% and 5.15% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, a volatility factor for the market price of the Company’s common stock of 66%,
49% and 69% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and a weighted-average expected life of options of approximately three years in 2002, 2001 and 2000. For purposes of these pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of options is amortized
over the options’ vesting period. Since the number of options granted and their fair value may vary significantly from year to year, the pro forma compensation expense in future years may be materially different.

Insurance

The Company is insured for general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation, and group
medical claims up to a specified claim and aggregate amounts (subject to deductibles of two million dollars for general liability and three million dollars for automobile liability). Insured losses subject to this deductible are accrued based upon
the aggregate liability for reported claims incurred and an estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported. These liabilities are not discounted.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” effective January 1, 2002. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17,
“Intangible Assets.” Under this standard, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests on a reporting unit level. For additional information see
Note 4. Other intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of”. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2002 and such adoption did not
have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”. This standard rescinds SFAS No.
4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt”, and an amendment of that Statement, SFAS No. 64, “Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements”. This standard also rescinds SFAS No. 44,
“Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers”. This standard amends SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases”, to eliminate an inconsistency related to the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and certain lease
modifications. This standard also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The Company adopted this standard on January 1,
2003, and will reclassify a pre-tax extraordinary loss of approximately $18.1 million recognized during the second quarter of 2001 to operating income. The adoption of the remaining provisions of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

activities and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the
date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. This standard nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)”. The restructuring charge in 2002 was recorded in accordance with EITF Issue No. 94-3. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. This interpretation requires certain guarantees entered into after December 31, 2002 to be initially
recognized and recorded at fair value and also requires new disclosures related to guarantees even if the likelihood of a guarantor having to make payments under the guarantees is remote. The Company adopted this interpretation as of December 31,
2002 and such adoption did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure”. This
standard provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” but does not require the Company to use the
fair value method. This standard also amends certain disclosure requirements related to stock-based employee compensation. The Company adopted the disclosure portion of this standard as of December 31, 2002 and such adoption is reflected under
“—Stock-Based Compensation” above.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

3.    Acquisitions

The acquisitions completed during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 include 2, 3 and 53 acquisitions, respectively, that were accounted for as purchases. The results of operations of the
businesses acquired in these acquisitions have been included in the Company’s results of operations from their respective acquisition dates.

On June 30, 2002, the Company acquired 35 rental locations from National Equipment Services, Inc. for initial consideration of
approximately $111.6 million in cash, which was determined based primarily on the number of locations acquired and their financial performance. The acquisition of these rental locations was made to complement the Company’s existing network of
rental locations. The results of operations of the acquisitions are included in the Company’s statement of operations as of the date of acquisition. The initial consideration paid by the Company for the other 2002 acquisition was approximately
$45.9 million in cash. The Company estimates that approximately $93.1 million of goodwill related to the 2002 acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes.

The aggregate initial consideration paid by the Company for 2001 acquisitions that were accounted for as purchases was approximately $12.1
million and consisted of approximately $11.5 million in cash and $0.6 million in seller notes. In addition, the Company repaid or assumed outstanding indebtedness in the aggregate amount of approximately $4.9 million.

During 2000, the Company purchased the outstanding stock and
certain assets of (i) Liddell Brothers Inc., in February, (ii) Safety Lites Sales and Leasing, Inc., in March, (iii) Durante Equipment Corp., Inc., in June, (iv) Horizon High Reach, Inc., in September, and (v) Wiese Planning & Engineering Inc.,
in December. The aggregate initial consideration paid for these five acquisitions that were accounted for as purchases was



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

approximately $153.1 million and consisted of $83.8 million in cash and 761,905 shares of common stock and $59.3 million in seller notes. In
addition, the Company repaid or assumed outstanding indebtedness of these companies acquired in the aggregate amount of approximately $5.5 million.

The aggregate initial consideration paid by the Company for other 2000 acquisitions that were accounted for as purchases was $210.2
million and consisted of approximately $184.6 million in cash and $6.2 million in seller notes. In addition, the Company repaid or assumed outstanding indebtedness of the companies acquired in the other 2000 acquisitions in the aggregate amount of
$77.5 million.

The purchase prices for all
acquisitions accounted for as purchases have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at their respective acquisition dates. However, the Company has not completed its valuation of all of
its purchases and, accordingly, the purchase price allocations are subject to change when additional information concerning asset and liability valuations are completed. The preliminary purchase price allocations that are subject to change primarily
consist of rental and non-rental equipment valuations. These allocations are finalized within 12 months of the acquisition date and are not expected to result in significant differences between the preliminary and final allocations.

The following table summarizes, on an unaudited pro forma
basis, the combined results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 as though each acquisition described above was made on January 1, 2001 (in thousands, except per share data).

The
unaudited pro forma results are based upon certain assumptions and estimates which are subject to change. These results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that might have occurred, nor are they necessarily indicative
of expected results in the future.

4.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Changes in the Company’s carrying amount of goodwill for 2002 are as follows (in thousands):

The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” issued by the Financial Accountants Standards Board (“FASB”). Under this standard, goodwill, which was previously amortized over 40 years, is no longer
amortized. The Company amortized approximately $58.4 million of goodwill in 2001. The



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company’s approximately $5.8 million of other intangible assets, will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Under
the new accounting standard, the Company is required to periodically review its goodwill for impairment. In general, this means that the Company must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill, calculated in accordance with applicable
accounting standards, is at least equal to the recorded value shown on its balance sheet. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value, the Company is required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense.

The Company completed its initial impairment analysis in the
first quarter of 2002 and recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $348.9 million ($288.3 million, net of tax). The Company completed a subsequent impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2002 and recorded an additional non-cash impairment
charge of approximately $247.9 million. The first impairment charge, net of tax, was recorded on the statement of operations as a “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle.” The second impairment charge was recorded on the
statement of operations as “goodwill impairment.” The Company’s stockholders’ equity was reduced by the amount of both charges.

The impairment charges recognized in 2002 related to certain branches that decreased in value. The factors that negatively affected the
value of these branches included the following: (i) continued weakness in non-residential construction spending which negatively affected the earnings of the Company’s branches and (ii) to a lesser extent, operational weakness at some branches
and increased competition for some branches. Fair values used in impairment testing were based upon valuation techniques using multiples of earnings and revenues.

The Company is required to review its goodwill for further impairment at least annually. Any future goodwill
impairment charge would be recorded on the statement of operations as “goodwill impairment” and would reduce operating income.

The Company tests for goodwill impairment on a branch-by-branch basis rather than on an aggregate basis. This means that a goodwill
write-off is required even if only one or a limited number of the Company’s branches has impairment and even if there is no impairment for all its branches on an aggregate basis. Factors that may cause future impairment at a particular branch,
in addition to macroeconomic factors that affect all the Company’s branches, include changes in local demand and local competitive conditions. Since the Company tests for impairment on a branch-by-branch basis, the Company believes that it may
be required to take additional non-cash goodwill write-offs in the future, although it cannot quantify at this time the magnitude of any future write-offs.



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The
reconciliation of previously reported net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding goodwill amortization is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands, except per share
data):

Other
intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements and are amortized over periods ranging from three to eight years. The cost of other intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2002 were $17.0 million and $11.2
million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2001 were $15.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Amortization expense of other intangible assets was $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

As of
December 31, 2002, estimated amortization expense of other intangible assets for each of the next five years is as follows (in thousands):

5.    Restructuring Charges

The Company adopted a restructuring plan in 2001 and a second restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2002 as described below. In connection with these plans, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $28.9 million
in 2001 (including a non-cash component of approximately $10.9 million) and $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 (including a non-cash component of approximately $2.5 million).

The 2001 plan involved the following principal elements: (i) 31 underperforming branches were closed or
consolidated with other locations, (ii) five administrative offices were closed or consolidated with other locations, (iii) the reduction of the Company’s workforce by 489 through the termination of branch and administrative personnel, and (iv)
certain information technology hardware and software was no longer used.

The 2002 plan involved the following key elements: (i) 42 underperforming branches and five administrative offices will be closed or consolidated with other locations (including 26 closed or consolidated as of December 31,
2002); (ii) the Company’s workforce will be reduced by 412 (including 232 terminated as of December 31, 2002), and (iii) a certain information technology project was abandoned.

The costs to vacate facilities primarily represent the payment of obligations under leases offset by
estimated sublease opportunities, the write-off of capital improvements made to such facilities and the write-off of related goodwill (only in 2001). The workforce reduction costs primarily represent severance. The information technology costs
represent the payment of obligations under equipment leases relating to the abandonment of certain information technology projects.

The aggregate balance of the 2001 and 2002 charges was $27.1 million as of December 31, 2002. The Company estimates that approximately
$13.4 million of this amount will be incurred by December 31, 2003 (comprised of approximately $12.4 million of the cash component and approximately $1.0 million of the non-cash component) and approximately $13.7 million will be paid in future
periods.

Components of the restructuring charges
are as follows:

Refinancing Transaction in 2002

.    On December 24, 2002, URI issued an additional $210.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 10


/


% Senior Notes (the
“new 10


/


% Notes”) which are due April 15, 2008 for approximately $203.8 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the new 10


/


% Notes were
approximately $199.4 million (after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses). The new 10


/


% Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to limited exceptions,
URI’s domestic subsidiaries. The new 10


/


% Notes mature on April 15, 2008 and may be redeemed by URI on or after April 15, 2005, at specified redemption prices that range from 105.375% in 2005 to 100.0% in 2007 and
thereafter. In addition, on or prior to April 15, 2004, URI may, at its option, use the proceeds of a public equity offering to redeem up to 35% of the outstanding new 10


/


% Notes at a
redemption price of 110.75%. The indenture governing the new 10


/


% Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on (i) additional indebtedness, (ii) restricted payments, (iii) liens, (iv) dividends
and other payments, (v) preferred stock of certain subsidiaries, (vi) transactions with affiliates, (vii) the disposition of proceeds of asset sales and (viii) the Company’s ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its
assets. The Company used the net proceeds from the new 10


/


% Notes to (i) permanently repay approximately $99.7 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s existing term loan and (ii) repay
approximately $99.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As a result of the refinancing, the Company recorded in other (income) expense a charge of approximately $1.6 million ($0.9 million, net of tax) related to
the write-off of financing fees.

Refinancing Transaction in 2001

.    In April 2001, the Company obtained a new senior secured credit facility and issued $450.0 million in 10


/


% senior notes. The
senior secured credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan. The proceeds from the senior secured credit facility and senior notes were used to refinance outstanding secured indebtedness of approximately $1,664.5
million and obligations under a synthetic lease of $31.2 million. As a result of the refinancing, the Company recorded an extraordinary charge of approximately $18.1 million ($11.3 million, net of tax), primarily related to the write-off of
financing fees, and a charge of approximately $7.8 million recorded in other (income) expense, net related to refinancing costs of the synthetic lease.

Revolving Credit Facility.

The revolving credit facility enables URI to borrow up to $650 million on a
revolving basis and enables one of its Canadian subsidiaries to borrow up to $50 million (provided that the aggregate borrowings of URI and the Canadian subsidiary may not exceed $650 million). Up to $175 million of the revolving credit facility is
available in the form of letters of credit ($111.6 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002). The revolving credit facility will mature and terminate on October 20, 2006.

As of December 31, 2002, borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the
Company’s option, at either (A) the ABR Rate (which is equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate

plus

0.5% or (ii) the Chase Manhattan Bank’s prime rate) plus a margin of 1.50% or (B) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of
2.50%. The above interest rate margins are adjusted quarterly based on the Company’s financial leverage ratio, up to maximum margins of 1.75% and 2.75%, for revolving loans based on the ABR rate and the adjusted LIBOR rate, respectively, and
down to minimum margins of 0.75% and 1.75%, for revolving loans based on the ABR rate and the adjusted LIBOR rate, respectively.

As of December 31, 2002, borrowings by the Canadian subsidiary under the revolving credit facility accrue interest, at such
subsidiary’s option, at either (X) the Prime rate (which is equal to the Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada’s prime rate) plus a margin of 1.50% or (Y) the B/A rate (which is equal to the Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada’s B/A rate) plus a
margin of 2.50%. The above interest rate margins are adjusted quarterly based on the Company’s financial leverage ratio, up to maximum margins of 1.75% and 2.75%, for revolving loans based on the Prime rate and the B/A rate, respectively, and
down to minimum margins of 0.75% and 1.75%, for revolving loans based on the Prime rate and the B/A rate, respectively. If at any time an event of default exists, the interest rate applicable to each loan will increase by 2% per annum.

The Company is also required to pay the lenders a commitment
fee equal to 0.5% per annum in respect of undrawn commitments under the revolving credit facility.

Term Loan.

On April 20, 2001, URI obtained a $750 million term loan. Amounts repaid in respect of the term
loan may not be reborrowed. URI must repay the principal of the term loan in installments. After giving effect to the prepayment of approximately $99.7 million of the term loan described above, remaining principal installments are: (i) on December
31, 2006, URI must repay approximately $107.5 million and (ii) on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter up to and including September 30, 2007, URI must repay approximately $177.2 million.

Borrowings under the term loan accrue interest, at URI’s
option, at either (a) the ABR rate (which is equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the Chase Manhattan Bank’s prime rate) plus a margin of 2.0%, or (b) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.0%.

Covenants.

The agreements
governing the senior secured credit facility contain certain covenants that require the Company to, among other things, satisfy certain financial tests relating to: (a) the ratio of senior debt



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

to cash flow, (b) minimum interest coverage ratio, (c) the ratio of funded debt to cash flow, and (d) the ratio of senior debt to tangible
assets. These agreements also contain various other covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) permit liens to attach to its assets, (iii) pay dividends or make other restricted
payments on its common stock and certain other securities, and (iv) make acquisitions unless certain financial conditions are satisfied.

Guarantees and Security.

URI’s obligations under the senior secured facility are, subject to limited
exceptions, (i) guaranteed by Holdings and URI’s United States subsidiaries and (ii) secured by substantially all of URI’s assets, the stock of URI and the stock of Holding’s other United States subsidiaries and a portion of the stock
of Holding’s Canadian subsidiaries. The obligations of the Canadian subsidiary that may borrow under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the Company’s other Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the
assets of this Canadian subsidiary and the stock of its subsidiaries.

(vii) the disposition of proceeds of asset sales, and (viii) the Company’s ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.

Receivables Securitization

.    The Company has an accounts receivable securitization facility under which one
of its subsidiaries can borrow up to $250 million against a collateral pool of accounts receivable. The borrowings under the facility and the receivables in the collateral pool are included in the liabilities and assets, respectively, reflected on
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Key terms of this facility include: (i) borrowings may be made only to the extent that the face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool exceeds the outstanding loans by a specified amount, (ii)
the facility is structured so that the receivables in the collateral



UNITED RENTALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

pool are the lenders’ only source of repayment, (iii) prior to expiration or early termination of the facility, amounts collected on the
receivables may, subject to certain conditions, be retained by the borrower, provided that the remaining receivables in the collateral pool are sufficient to secure the then outstanding borrowings, and (iv) after expiration or early termination of
the facility, the Company will repay the borrowings.

As of December 31, 2002, (i) the outstanding borrowings under the facility were approximately $160.5 million and (ii) the aggregate face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool was approximately $346.8 million. The agreement
governing this facility, which was amended in June 2001, contemplates that the term of the facility may extend for up to three years from the date of the amended facility. However, on each anniversary of such date, the consent of the lender is
required for the facility to renew for the next year. The next anniversary date is in June 2003. The Company plans to seek the lenders’ approval for renewal. However, the Company cannot be certain it will be able to obtain such renewal with
comparable terms or at all.

Interest Rate
Swap Agreements.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements that convert $200 million of its variable rate term loan to a fixed rate instrument through 2003. These swap agreements
are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair values of the Company’s cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.
The Company also had outstanding interest rate swap agreements that convert $300 million of its fixed rate 9


/


% Notes to a floating rate instrument through 2009. These swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair values of the Company’s fair value hedges, as well as the offsetting fair value changes in the hedged items, are recorded on the statement of operations. The Company estimates the amount that will be reclassified into
earnings in 2003 is approximately $2.1 million. There is no ineffectiveness related to the Company’s hedges.

Maturities

.    Maturities of the Company’s debt for each of the next five years at December 31, 2002 are
as follows (in thousands):

The
maturities in 2003 are comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility. As described above, the annual renewal of the Company’s accounts receivable securitization facility requires the
lenders’ consent. If the Company does not obtain this consent, then the facility will terminate in June 2003 and the Company will repay the borrowings thereunder.

The
current and deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2002 include the effects of certain reclassifications related to differences between the income tax provisions and tax returns for prior years. These reclassifications had no effect on
net income.

For financial reporting purposes,
income before income taxes and extraordinary items for the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $9.2 million, $8.6 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
unremitted earnings (deficit) of foreign subsidiaries were approximately $(1.7) million and $27.6 million, respectively. Since it is the Company’s intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings, no United States taxes have been provided.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted taxes is not practicable.

The Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL’s”) of $564.2 million for federal income tax purposes that expire
through 2022.

Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust and Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock

Trust
Securities.

In August 1998, a subsidiary trust (the “Trust”) of Holdings issued and sold in a private offering (the “Preferred Securities Offering”) $300.0 million of 30 year, 6


/


% Convertible Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (the “Preferred Securities”). The Trust used the proceeds from the Preferred Securities Offering to purchase 6


/


% convertible
subordinated debentures due 2028 (the “Debentures”) from Holdings which resulted in Holdings receiving all of the net proceeds of the Preferred Securities Offering. Holdings in turn contributed the net proceeds of the Preferred Securities
Offering to URI. The Preferred Securities are non-voting securities, carry a liquidation value of $50 per security and are convertible into the Company’s common stock at an initial rate of 1.146 shares per security (equivalent to an initial
conversion price of $43.63 per share). They are convertible at any time at the holders’ option and are redeemable, at the Company’s option, after three years, subject to certain conditions.

Holders of the Preferred Securities are entitled to
preferential cumulative cash distributions from the Trust at an annual rate of 6


/


% of the liquidation value, accruing from the original issue date and payable quarterly in arrears beginning
February 1, 1999. The distribution rate and dates correspond to the interest rate and payment dates on the Debentures. Holdings may defer interest payments on the Debentures for up to twenty consecutive quarters, but not beyond the maturity date of
the Debentures. If interest payments on the Debentures are deferred, so are the payments on the Preferred Securities. Under this circumstance, Holdings will be prohibited from paying dividends on any of its capital stock or making payments with
respect to its debt that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures.

shares of common
stock subject to adjustment (representing a conversion price of $30 per share based on the liquidation preference); (iii) the holders of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred (on an as converted basis) and the holders of the common stock
vote together as a single class on all matters (except that the Series C Preferred may vote as a separate class as described in the next clause); (iv) the holders of the Series C Preferred, voting separately as a single class, may elect two
directors (subject to reduction to one, if the shares of Series C Preferred owned by specified holders cease to represent, on an as converted basis, at least eight million shares of common stock, and reduction to zero, if such shares of Series C
Preferred cease to represent at least four million shares of common stock), (v) there are no stated dividends on the Series C Preferred or Series D Preferred, but the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred, on an as converted basis, will
participate in any dividends declared on the common stock, (vi) upon the occurrence of specified change of control transactions, other than a Non-Approved Change of Control (as defined below), the Company must offer to redeem the Series C Preferred
and Series D Preferred at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to 6.25% of the liquidation preference compounded annually from the date of the issuance of the Series A Preferred, in the case of the Series C
Preferred, and the date of the issuance of the Series B Preferred, in the case of the Series D Preferred, to the redemption date, (vii) if the Company issues for cash common stock (or a series of preferred stock convertible into common stock) and
the price for the common stock is below the conversion price of the Series C Preferred, then the Company must offer to repurchase a specified portion of the outstanding Series C Preferred at the price per share set forth in the preceding clause, and
(viii) if the Company issues for cash common stock (or a series of preferred stock convertible into common stock) for a price for the common stock below the conversion price of the Series D Preferred, then the Company must offer to repurchase a
specified portion of the outstanding Series D Preferred at the price per share specified in the second preceding clause.

Special Rights of Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred Upon Non-Approved Change of Control.

In general,
a Non-Approved Change of Control transaction is a change of control transaction that the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has disapproved and which the Board has not facilitated by such actions as weakening or eliminating the
Company’s Stockholder Rights Plan. If a Non-Approved Change of Control occurs, and the Board does not offer the holders of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred essentially the same redemption

15.    Commitments and Contingencies

Operating Leases

The
Company leases rental equipment, real estate and certain office equipment under operating leases. Certain real estate leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance, taxes and certain other expenses in addition to the stated rentals.
Future minimum lease payments, by year and in the aggregate, for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows at December 31, 2002:

As part
of certain of its equipment operating leases, the Company guarantees that the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term will not be less than a specified projected residual value. The use of these guarantees helps to lower the
Company’s monthly operating lease payments. The Company believes that the projected residual values are reasonable and, accordingly, that it is not likely to incur material obligations pursuant to such guarantees. However, the Company cannot be
certain that the actual residual values will not turn out to be significantly below the projected values that the Company guaranteed. The Company’s maximum potential liability under these guarantees is $231.6 million, which represents the
aggregate amount that it would be required to pay if the residual value was zero for all equipment subject to such guarantees. In conformity with applicable accounting standards, this potential liability is not recorded on the Company’s balance
sheet.

The Company was the seller-lessee in
sale-leaseback transactions with unrelated third parties in which it sold rental equipment for aggregate proceeds of $3.4 million in 2002, rental equipment and real estate for aggregate proceeds of $51.0 million in 2001, and rental equipment for
aggregate proceeds of $218.8 million in 2000. For the 2002 transactions, the Company leased back the rental equipment for a minor period of one to eight months. For the 2001 transactions, the Company leased back the real estate over a 10-year period
and the rental equipment for a minor period of one to eight months. For the 2000 transactions, the Company leased back a portion of the rental equipment for a minor period of one to eight months, and the balance over a five-year period. The total
gains related to these transactions in 2002, 2001, and 2000 were, respectively, approximately $1.5 million of which none was deferred, $21.6 million of which $1.4 million was deferred, and approximately $16.5 million of which $4.0 million was
deferred. The deferred gains are amortized over the respective lease periods on a straight-line basis.

Rent expense under all non-cancelable real estate, rental equipment and other equipment operating leases totaled $185.0 million, $170.9
million, and $137.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Company’s real estate leases provide for varying terms, including leases subject to customary escalation clauses, and include 43 leases that
are on a month-to-month basis and 36 leases that provide for a remaining term of less than one year and do not provide a renewal option.

Restricted Stock Awards

The Company has granted to employees other
than executive officers and directors approximately 1,165,000 shares of restricted stock that contain the following provisions. The shares vest in 2004, 2005 or 2006 or earlier upon a change in control of the Company, death, disability, retirement
or certain terminations of employment, and are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting on certain other terminations of employment, the violation of non-compete provisions and certain other events. The grants provide that the Company will pay to
employees who vest in their restricted stock, and who sell their restricted stock within five trading days after vesting, a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of approximately $300,000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of
these sales are less than $27.26 but more than $15.17, a maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of approximately $500,000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales are less than $15.17 but more than $9.18, and a
maximum aggregate amount for all these employees of approximately $1,165,000 for each dollar by which the per share proceeds of these sales are less than $9.18.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company currently sponsors one defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan which is subject to the provisions of ERISA. The Company
also sponsors a deferred profit sharing plan for the benefit of the full-time employees of its Canadian subsidiaries. Under these plans, the Company matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions up to a specified amount. Company
contributions to the plans were $5.2 million, $6.0 million, and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Legal and Insurance Matters

The Company is party to legal proceedings and potential claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of
management, the Company has adequate legal defenses, reserves, or insurance coverage with respect to these matters so that the ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. The Company had accrued $22.2 million and $28.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, to cover the uninsured portion of estimated costs arising from these pending claims and other potential unasserted
claims.

Environmental Matters

The Company and its operations are subject to various laws
and related regulations governing environmental matters. Under such laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such
property, as well as investigation of property damage. The Company incurs ongoing expenses associated with the removal of underground storage tanks and the performance of appropriate remediation at certain of its locations. The Company believes that
such removal and remediation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

16.    Segment Information

Each of the Company’s branch locations is an operating segment which consists of the rental and sales of equipment and related
merchandise and parts. Certain of the Company’s branches also provide specialty traffic control services as a product line. Of the total revenues for these branches, the amount of revenue attributable to such traffic control services was $291.6
million, $272.2 million, and $245.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. All of the Company’s branches have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they offer similar products and services
in similar markets and the factors determining strategic decisions are comparable.

all wholly-owned and the guarantees are made on a joint and several basis and are full and unconditional (subject to subordination provisions and subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor
will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws). Separate consolidated financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented because management
believes that such information would not be material to investors. However, condensed consolidating financial information as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, are presented. The

of Directors

United

Rentals, Inc. (Parent Company of United Rentals (North America), Inc.)

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Rentals (North America), Inc. as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of United Rentals (North America), Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Rentals (North America), Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Accounting
Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” effective January 1, 2002.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation

United Rentals (North America), Inc., (“URI”) and subsidiaries is a wholly owned subsidiary of United Rentals, Inc., which is principally a holding company (“Holdings” or “Parent”). Holdings was
incorporated in July 1998 and became the parent of URI on August 5, 1998, pursuant to the reorganization of the legal structure of URI. Prior to such reorganization, the name of URI was United Rentals, Inc. References herein to the
“Company” refer to URI and its subsidiaries.

Certain footnotes are not provided for the accompanying financial statements as the information in Notes 1 through 10, 12, 13 and 15 through 17 to the consolidated financial statements of United Rentals, Inc. included elsewhere in
this report is substantially equivalent to that required for the consolidated financial statements of URI and its subsidiaries. Earnings per share data is not provided for the operating results of URI and subsidiaries, as they are wholly owned
subsidiaries of Holdings. URI’s various credit agreements and debt instruments place restrictions on its ability to transfer funds to its shareholder.

Holdings provides certain services to URI in connection with its operations. These services principally include: (i) senior management
services, (ii) finance related services and support, (iii) information technology systems and support and (iv) acquisition related services. In addition, Holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by URI and
its subsidiaries. URI has made, and expects to continue to make, certain payments to Holdings in respect of the services provided by Holdings to the Company. The expenses relating to URI’s payments to Holdings are reflected on URI’s
financial statements as selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, although not legally obligated to do so, URI has in the past made, and expects that it will in the future make, distributions to Holdings for, among other things,
enabling Holdings to pay dividends on its preferred securities.

2.    Capital Stock and Contributions

At December 31, 2002, the Company had authorized 3,000 shares of its $0.01 par value common stock of which 1,000 shares were issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding common shares of
URI are owned by its Parent.

Pursuant to the
reorganization described in Note 1, the net proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering completed in December 1997 and the public offering completed in March 1998 have been reflected as Contributed Capital from the Parent in the
accompanying statement of stockholder’s equity. Holdings also contributed the net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred securities in August 1998 to URI. During 1999, Holdings contributed the net proceeds from the
issuance of common stock in a public offering and the net proceeds from the issuance of perpetual convertible preferred stock to URI.

3.    Condensed Consolidating Financial Information of Guarantor Subsidiaries

Certain indebtedness of URI is guaranteed by URI’s
United States subsidiaries (the “guarantor subsidiaries”) but is not guaranteed by URI’s foreign subsidiaries (the “non-guarantor subsidiaries”). The guarantor subsidiaries are all wholly-owned and the guarantees are made on
a joint and several basis and are full and unconditional (subject to subordination provisions and subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws). Separate consolidated financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented because management believes that such

information would not be material to investors. However, condensed consolidating financial information as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
