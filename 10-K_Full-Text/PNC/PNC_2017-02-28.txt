PART I

Forward-Looking Statements: From time to time, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC or the Corporation) has made and may continue to make written or oral forward-looking statements regarding our
outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations or the impact of legal, regulatory
or supervisory matters on our business operations or performance. This Annual Report on Form

10-K

(the Report or Form

10-K)

also includes forward-looking statements.
With respect to all such forward-looking statements, you should review our Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A, our Risk Management, Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgments, and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information sections
included in Item 7, and Note 19 Legal Proceedings and Note 20 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. See page 75 for a glossary of certain terms used in this Report.

ITEM 1 – BUSINESS

Business Overview

Headquartered
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management, and residential mortgage
banking, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our primary geographic markets are located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware,
Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We also provide certain products and services internationally. At December 31, 2016, our consolidated total assets, total deposits and total shareholders’ equity were
$366.4 billion, $257.2 billion and $45.7 billion, respectively.

We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation. Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through internal growth, strategic
bank and

non-bank

acquisitions and equity investments, and the formation of various

non-banking

subsidiaries.

Review of Business Segments

In addition to the following information relating to
our lines of business, we incorporate the information under the caption Business Segments Review in Item 7 of this Report here by reference. Also, we include the financial and other information by business in Note 22 Segment Reporting in the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report here by reference.

Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to
foreign activities were not material in the periods presented. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new
methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period. See Note 22 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report
for information on enhancements made in the first quarter of 2015 to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology.

Retail Banking

provides deposit, lending, brokerage, investment management and cash management
services to consumer and small business customers within our primary geographic markets. Our customers are serviced through our branch network, ATMs, call centers, online banking and mobile channels. The branch network is located primarily in
Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina.

Our core strategy is to acquire and retain customers who maintain their primary checking and transaction relationships with us. We also seek to deepen
relationships by meeting the broad range of our customers’ financial needs with savings, liquidity, lending, investment and retirement solutions. A strategic priority for us is to redefine the retail banking business in response to changing
customer preferences. A key element of this strategy is to expand the use of lower-cost alternative distribution channels, with an emphasis on mobile and online banking capabilities, while continuing to optimize the traditional branch network. In
addition, we have a disciplined process to continually improve the engagement of both our employees and customers, which is a strong indicator of customer growth, retention and relationship expansion.

Corporate & Institutional Banking

provides lending, treasury management, and capital markets-related products and services
to

mid-sized

and large corporations, government and

not-for-profit

entities. Lending products include secured and unsecured
loans, letters of credit and equipment leases. Treasury management services include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services, funds transfer services, information reporting and global trade services. Capital
markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. We also provide commercial loan servicing and
technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry. Products and services are generally provided within our primary geographic markets, with certain products and services offered nationally and internationally.

Corporate & Institutional Banking’s strategy is to be the leading relationship-based provider of traditional banking products and services
to its customers through the economic

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



cycles. We aim to expand our market share and drive higher returns by growing and deepening customer relationships through solutions-based selling, while maintaining prudent risk and expense
management.

Asset Management Group

provides personal wealth management for high net worth and ultra high net worth
clients and institutional asset management. Wealth management products and services include investment and retirement planning, customized investment management, private banking, tailored credit solutions, and trust management and administration for
individuals and their families. Our Hawthorn unit provides multi-generational family planning including estate, financial, tax planning, fiduciary, investment management and consulting, private banking, personal administrative services, asset
custody and customized performance reporting to ultra high net worth families. Institutional asset management provides advisory, custody and retirement administration services. The business also offers PNC proprietary mutual funds. Institutional
clients include corporations, unions, municipalities,

non-profits,

foundations and endowments, primarily located in our geographic footprint.

Asset Management Group is focused on being one of the premier bank-held individual and institutional asset managers in each of the markets it serves. The business seeks to deliver high quality banking,
trust and investment management services to our high net worth, ultra high net worth and institutional client sectors through a broad array of products and services. Asset Management Group’s primary goals are to service our clients, grow the
business and deliver solid financial performance with prudent risk and expense management.

Residential Mortgage Banking

directly
originates first lien residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis with a significant presence within the retail banking footprint. Mortgage loans represent loans collateralized by

one-to-four-family

residential real estate. These loans are typically underwritten to government agency and/or third-party standards, and either sold with servicing
retained, or held on PNC’s balance sheet. Loan sales are primarily to secondary mortgage conduits of Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Federal Home Loan Banks and third-party
investors, or are securitized and issued under the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) program, as described in more detail in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in Item 8 of this Report and
included here by reference. The mortgage servicing operation performs all functions related to servicing mortgage loans, primarily those in first lien position, for various investors and for loans owned by us.

Residential Mortgage Banking is focused on adding value to the PNC franchise by building stronger customer relationships and providing quality investment
loans and mortgage servicing opportunities. A strategic focus for us is to transform the home lending process by integrating our mortgage and home equity

lending into a common platform for improved efficiency and a better customer experience. Our national distribution capability provides volume that drives economies of scale, risk dispersion and
cost-effective extension of the retail banking footprint to serve our customers with home financing needs and offer them our full suite of retail products.

BlackRock

, in which we hold an equity investment, is a leading publicly traded investment management firm providing a broad range of investment and risk management services to institutional and
retail clients worldwide. Using a diverse platform of active and index investment strategies across asset classes, BlackRock develops investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset
class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. BlackRock also offers an investment and risk management technology platform, risk analytics, advisory and technology services and solutions to a broad
base of institutional and wealth management investors. Our equity investment in BlackRock provides us with an additional source of noninterest income and increases our overall revenue diversification. BlackRock is a publicly traded company, and
additional information regarding its business is available in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Non-Strategic

Assets Portfolio

consists of a consumer portfolio of mainly residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans and lines of credit and a small commercial lending portfolio. We obtained a
significant portion of these

non-strategic

assets through acquisitions of other companies.

Total
business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income, as presented in Note 22 Segment Reporting in Item 8 of this Report. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category. “Other”
includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net
securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not
allocated to business segments, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results
exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we intend to realign
our segments with how we began managing our businesses in 2017 and we intend to change the basis of presentation of our segments as follows:

•

Residential Mortgage Banking will be combined into Retail Banking,


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


•

Non-Strategic

Assets Portfolio will be eliminated and the assets will be moved to Other and
Corporate & Institutional Banking,

•

Residential mortgages within Other will be moved to Retail Banking, and

•

A portion of business banking will be moved from Retail Banking to Corporate & Institutional Banking.

We also are making certain adjustments to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Prior periods will be restated to conform to the new segment
alignment and to our change in methodology.

Subsidiaries

Our corporate legal structure at December 31, 2016 consisted of one domestic subsidiary bank, including its subsidiaries, and approximately 60 active

non-bank

subsidiaries, in addition to various affordable housing investments. Our bank subsidiary is PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank), a national bank headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. For additional information on our subsidiaries, see
Exhibit 21 to this Report.

Supervision and Regulation

PNC is a bank holding company (BHC) registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act).

We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our regulatory matters. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments, impose conditions and requirements on the products
and services we offer and the manner in which they are offered and sold, and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, investment management and other customers, among other things. They also restrict our ability
to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. The consequences of noncompliance with these, or other applicable laws or regulations, can include
substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.

In addition, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and periodic examination by, among
other regulatory bodies, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
supervisory policies of the agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors. The results of examination activity by any of our federal
bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated
entity and take enforcement action, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements, against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines, among other things, that such operations fail to comply
with applicable law or regulations or are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner. This supervisory framework, including the examination reports and supervisory ratings (which are not publicly available) of the agencies, could materially impact the
conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is responsible for examining PNC Bank
and its affiliates (including PNC) for compliance with most federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws relating to fair lending and prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or
provision of consumer financial products or services, and for enforcing such laws with respect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The results of the CFPB’s examinations (which are not publicly

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



available) also can result in restrictions or limitations on the operations of a regulated entity as well as enforcement actions against a regulated entity, including the imposition of
substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements.

We also are subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of our status as a public
company and by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) due to the nature of some of our businesses. Our banking and securities businesses, as well as those conducted by BlackRock, with operations outside the United States are
also subject to regulation by appropriate authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which they do business.

As a regulated financial
services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the operation and growth of our businesses. The Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad
enforcement powers, and certain of the regulators have the power to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our applications or notices to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses, assets or deposits, or reconfigure existing operations.

We anticipate new legislative and regulatory initiatives over the next several years, focused specifically on banking and other financial
services in which we are engaged. Legislative and regulatory developments to date, as well as those that come in the future, have had and are likely to continue to have an impact on the conduct of our business. The more detailed description of the
significant regulations to which we are subject included in this Report is based on the current regulatory environment and is subject to potentially material change. See also the additional information included as Risk Factors in Item 1A of
this Report discussing the impact of financial regulatory reform initiatives, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), and regulations promulgated to implement it, on the regulatory environment for us and
the financial services industry.

Among other areas that have been receiving a high level of regulatory focus over the last several years are
compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws, capital and liquidity management, cyber-security, the oversight of arrangements with third-party vendors and suppliers, the protection of confidential customer information, and the
structure and effectiveness of enterprise risk management frameworks. In addition, there is an increased focus on fair lending and other consumer protection issues, including retail sales practices and fee assessment and collection.

New legislation, changes in rules promulgated by federal financial regulators, other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory
organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of our

businesses. The profitability of our businesses could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial sectors in general, including changes to the laws governing
taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

The new presidential administration has laid out certain regulatory policy objectives
and core principles to guide financial law and regulation in a series of recent executive orders and other actions. For example, the new presidential administration has directed the heads of executive departments and agencies to, among other things,
temporarily suspend rulemaking until a new agency principal nominated by the administration has reviewed and approved any new regulations and to identify two existing regulations for repeal in connection with the issuance of any new rule. The
administration also has announced a set of core principles intended to guide financial regulation, which include, among other things, rebalancing the goals of financial regulation to foster job and economic growth in addition to promoting financial
stability, and that direct the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the heads of the federal agencies that comprise the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to conduct a review of existing financial laws, regulations, guidance and other
requirements to determine the extent to which these promote the announced core principles. Whether and how these developments may impact the rules and policies applicable to us remains at this point unclear.

There are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, the following discussion
is general in nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws, regulations and supervisory policies that apply to us. To a substantial extent, the purpose of the regulation and supervision of financial services institutions
and their holding companies is not to protect our shareholders and our

non-customer

creditors, but rather to protect our customers (including depositors) and the financial markets and financial system in
general.

Dodd-Frank Act

Dodd-Frank, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, comprehensively reformed the regulation of financial institutions, products and services.
Dodd-Frank requires various federal regulatory agencies to implement numerous new rules and regulations. Among other things, Dodd-Frank established the CFPB and the FSOC, a

10-member

inter-agency body that is
charged with identifying and monitoring systemic risks and strengthening the regulation of financial holding companies and certain

non-bank

companies deemed to be “systemically important”; provided
for new capital standards that eliminate the treatment of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 regulatory capital; required that deposit insurance assessments be calculated based on an insured depository institution’s assets rather than its
insured deposits; raised the minimum


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


Designated Reserve Ratio (the balance in the Deposit Insurance Fund divided by estimated insured deposits) to 1.35%; established a comprehensive regulatory regime for the derivatives activities
of financial institutions; prohibited banking entities, after a transition period and subject to certain exceptions and exemptions, from engaging in proprietary trading, as well as acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring, and
having certain types of relationships with hedge funds, private equity funds, and other private funds (through provisions commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”); placed limitations on the interchange fees charged for debit card
transactions; and established new minimum mortgage underwriting standards for residential mortgages. Certain of the rules required by Dodd-Frank have not been proposed or finalized.

Banking Regulation and Supervision

Enhanced Prudential Requirements

.

Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to establish enhanced prudential standards for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as PNC, as well as systemically important

non-bank

financial companies designated by the FSOC for Federal Reserve supervision. For such BHCs, these enhanced standards must be more stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to BHCs with less than $50 billion in assets, and must
increase in stringency based on the Federal Reserve’s assessment of a BHC’s risk to the financial system. The FSOC may make recommendations to the Federal Reserve concerning the establishment and refinement of these enhanced prudential
standards.

The Federal Reserve has adopted enhanced prudential standards related to liquidity risk management and overall risk management,
which took effect for us on January 1, 2015. These rules, among other things, require that covered BHCs conduct liquidity stress tests at least monthly, maintain a contingency funding plan and sufficient highly liquid assets to meet net stress

cash-flow

needs (as projected under the company’s liquidity stress tests) for 30 days, and establish certain oversight and governance responsibilities for the chief risk officer, the board of directors, and the
risk committee of the board of directors of a covered company. These standards also require the Federal Reserve to impose a maximum

15-to-1

debt to equity ratio on a BHC
if the FSOC determines that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States and that the imposition of such a

debt-to-equity

requirement
would mitigate such risk.

In March 2016, the Federal Reserve requested comment on a revised set of proposed rules that would establish a
single counterparty credit limit for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. Under the proposed rules, the aggregate net credit exposure by us, including our subsidiaries, to any single, unaffiliated counterparty, including
its subsidiaries, would be calculated on a daily basis and could not exceed 25 percent of our Tier 1 capital. The proposed limit would cover credit exposure resulting from, among other

transactions, extensions of credit, repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, purchases or investments in securities, and derivative transactions, although certain exposures, including,
among others, exposures to the United States government, are excluded. Compliance with the proposed rules would be required one year after the effective date. The comment period on the proposal closed on June 3, 2016. The proposed rule, if
finalized, would not have a material impact on our credit relationships with third parties.

The Federal Reserve continues to work towards
finalizing the early remediation requirements that it must establish under Dodd-Frank for BHCs with more than $50 billion in total assets. In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to continue to develop the set of enhanced
prudential standards that apply to large BHCs in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the U.S. financial system. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.

Regulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital Planning

. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements
established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. The foundation of the agencies’ regulatory capital rules is the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee),
the international body responsible for developing global regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted rules to implement the new
international regulatory capital standards established by the Basel Committee, known as “Basel III”, as well as to implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. Many provisions are

phased-in

over a
period of years, with the rules generally fully

phased-in

as of January 1, 2019.

The rules
adopted in July 2013 generally have three fundamental parts. The first part, referred to as the Basel III capital rule, among other things, narrowed the definition of regulatory capital, requires banking organizations with $15 billion or
more in assets (including PNC) to

phase-out

trust preferred securities from Tier 1 regulatory capital, establishes a new common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital regulatory requirement for banking organizations,
and revises the capital levels at which PNC and PNC Bank would be subject to prompt corrective action. These rules also require that significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as mortgage servicing rights
and deferred tax assets, be deducted from CET1 regulatory capital to the extent such items individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the organization’s adjusted Basel III CET1 regulatory capital. Our common stock investment in
BlackRock is treated as a significant common stock investment in an unconsolidated financial institution for these purposes. The Basel III capital rule also significantly limits the extent to which minority interests in consolidated

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



subsidiaries (including minority interests in the form of REIT preferred securities) may be included in regulatory capital. In addition, for banking organizations, like PNC, which are subject to
the advanced approaches (described below), the rule includes other comprehensive income related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans as a component of CET1 capital. The Basel III capital rule became
effective on January 1, 2014 for PNC and PNC Bank, although many provisions are

phased-in

over a period of years.

The Basel III rule generally divides regulatory capital into three components: CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital (which, together with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.
CET1 capital is generally common stock, retained earnings, qualifying minority interest and, for advanced approaches banking organizations, accumulated other comprehensive income, less the deductions required to be made from CET1 capital. Additional
Tier 1 capital generally includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests, less the deductions required to be made from additional Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital generally comprises qualifying subordinated
debt, less any required deductions from Tier 2 capital. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, less the deductions required from total capital.

The second major part of the rules adopted in July 2013 is referred to as the standardized approach and materially revises the framework for the risk-weighting of assets under Basel I. Under the
regulatory capital rules, a banking organization’s risk-based capital ratios are calculated by allocating assets and specified

off-balance

sheet financial instruments into risk-weighted categories (with
higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk), which are used to determine the amount of a banking organization’s total risk-weighted assets. The standardized approach for risk-weighted
assets takes into account credit and market risk. To calculate risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach for credit risk, the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of

off-balance

sheet items are generally multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages set forth in the rules and that increase as the perceived credit risk of the relevant asset increases. For certain
types of exposures, such as securitization exposures, the standardized approach establishes one or more methodologies that are to be used to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the exposure. The standardized approach took effect on
January 1, 2015 for PNC.

The third part of the rules adopted in July 2013 is referred to as the advanced approaches and materially
revises the framework for the risk-weighting of assets under Basel II. The Basel II framework, which was adopted by the Basel Committee in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk

management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. Advanced approaches risk-weighted assets take into account credit, market and operational risk and rely to a
significant extent on internal models. The advanced approaches modifications adopted by the U.S. banking agencies became effective on January 1, 2014, and generally apply to banking organizations (such as PNC and PNC Bank) that have
$250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or that have $10 billion or more in

on-balance

sheet foreign exposure. Prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches to calculate risk-weighted
assets, PNC and PNC Bank must successfully complete a “parallel run” qualification phase. PNC and PNC Bank entered this parallel run qualification phase on January 1, 2013. As discussed further in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report,
the Basel Committee continues to consider additional, significant changes to the international capital framework for banking organizations. The timing of the Basel Committee’s work, the likelihood that these or similar changes would be
implemented by the U.S. banking agencies in the United States, and the implications of any such developments on the U.S. regulatory capital framework (including the advanced approaches and the parallel run qualification period for PNC and PNC Bank)
are not fully known at this time.

As a result of the

phase-in

periods included in the Basel III
rules, as well as the fact that we remain in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2016 were based on the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under Basel III
(as such definitions and deductions were

phased-in

for 2016) and the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Until we have exited parallel run, our regulatory risk-based Basel III ratios
will be calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are

phased-in

through 2019). Once we exit parallel run, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios will be the lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the

phased-in

Basel III provisions as the Transitional Basel III ratios. The Transitional Basel III regulatory capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank as of December 31, 2016 exceeded the applicable minimum levels in
effect for 2016. For additional information regarding the Transitional Basel III capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank as of December 31, 2016, as well as the levels needed to be considered “well capitalized”, see the Capital Management
portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

The Federal Reserve has adopted rules to apply an additional risk-based
CET1 capital surcharge to U.S. firms identified as globally systemically important banks (GSIBs) using a scoring methodology that is based on five measures of global systemic importance (size, interconnectedness, substitutability,


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity). In addition, in December 2016, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that require U.S. GSIBs and the U.S. operations of foreign-based GSIBs to meet a
new minimum long-term debt requirement and a new minimum total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirement. The GSIB surcharge and the new minimum long-term debt and TLAC requirements are subject to a phase in period and will be fully effective on
January 1, 2019. We are not a GSIB based on the methodology described above and, therefore, are not subject to these requirements.

The
risk-based capital rules that the federal banking regulators have adopted require the

capital-to-assets

ratios of banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank, to
meet certain minimum standards. Banking organizations must maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets, to be considered “adequately
capitalized.” Banking organizations also must maintain a capital conservation buffer requirement above the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividends and repurchases
of any Tier 1 capital instrument, including common and qualifying preferred stock) and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. The multi-year

phase-in

of the capital conservation buffer
requirement began on January 1, 2016, and, for 2017, banking organizations (including PNC and PNC Bank) are required to maintain a risk-based CET1 capital ratio of at least 5.75%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.5%, and a total capital
ratio of at least 9.5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. When fully

phased-in

on January 1, 2019, banking organizations must maintain
a CET1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of at least 10.5%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets, to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary
incentive compensation payments.

For banking organizations that are subject to the advanced approaches (such as PNC and PNC Bank), these
higher capital conservation buffer levels above the regulatory minimums could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer based on U.S. credit exposures of up to an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets (once fully

phased-in).

This buffer is currently set at zero in the United States. In September 2016, the Federal Reserve finalized a policy statement on the framework and factors the Federal Reserve would use in setting and
adjusting the amount of the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer. Covered banking organizations would generally have 12 months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement,
unless the Federal Reserve determines to establish an earlier effective date. Under the

phase-in

schedule for the countercyclical capital buffer, the maximum potential countercyclical capital buffer amount is
1.25% in 2017, 1.875% in 2018, and 2.5% in 2019 and thereafter. When fully

phased-in

and if the full buffer amount is implemented, covered banking organizations would be required to maintain a risk-based CET1 capital ratio of at
least 9.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 11%, and a total capital ratio of at least 13% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments.

The regulatory capital framework adopted by the federal banking regulators also requires that banking organizations maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1
capital to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. Banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%. As of December 31, 2016, the leverage ratios of PNC
and PNC Bank were above the required minimum level.

Banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches (such as PNC and PNC Bank) also
will be subject to a new minimum 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio that becomes effective on January 1, 2018. The supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure, which takes into account

on-balance

sheet assets as well as certain

off-balance

sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. BHCs with total
consolidated assets of more than $700 billion or assets under custody of more than $10 trillion, as well as the insured depository institution subsidiaries of these BHCs, are subject to a higher supplementary leverage ratio requirement. These
higher supplementary leverage requirements do not apply to PNC or PNC Bank.

Failure to meet applicable capital requirements could subject a
banking organization to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal bank regulatory agencies, including a limitation on the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital and, in
severe cases, the termination of deposit insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. In some cases, the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is
considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, the smaller an institution’s capital
base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers. Business activities may also be affected by an institution’s capital classification. For example, in order for PNC to remain
a financial holding company and engage in the broader range of financial activities authorized for such a company, PNC and PNC Bank must remain “well capitalized.” At December 31, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required ratios
for classification as “well capitalized.” The thresholds at which an insured depository institution is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” are based on (i) the institution’s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



ratios; (ii) the institution’s leverage ratio; and (iii) for the definitions of “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized”, the institution’s
supplementary leverage ratio (if applicable) once the supplementary leverage ratio takes effect as a minimum requirement in 2018. For additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, we refer you to the Capital Management portion of the Risk
Management section of Item 7 of this Report and to Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

In addition to these regulatory capital requirements, we are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, annual capital stress testing requirements and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review (CCAR) process, as well as the annual and

mid-year

Dodd-Frank capital stress testing (DFAST) requirements of the Federal Reserve (annual and

mid-cycle)

and the
OCC (annual). As part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of BHCs, including PNC, that have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For us, this capital adequacy
assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve that describes the company’s planned capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase common stock
repurchase programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve under different hypothetical
macro-economic scenarios, including a supervisory adverse scenario and severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve can object to our capital plan for qualitative or quantitative reasons. If the Federal Reserve
objects to a BHC’s capital plan, the BHC cannot make capital distributions without specific Federal Reserve approval.

In evaluating
capital plans of BHCs with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in

on-balance

sheet foreign exposure, or $75 million or more in nonbank assets, the Federal
Reserve considers a number of qualitative factors, which have become increasingly important in the CCAR process in recent years. The Federal Reserve’s supervisory expectations for the capital planning and stress testing processes at large and
complex BHCs, including PNC, are heightened relative to smaller and less complex BHCs. In assessing a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes, the Federal Reserve considers whether the BHC has sound and effective governance to
oversee these processes. The Federal Reserve’s evaluation focuses on whether a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes are supported by a strong risk management framework to identify, measure and assess material risks and that
provides a strong foundation to capital planning. The Federal Reserve also considers the comprehensiveness of a BHC’s control framework and evaluates a BHC’s policy guidelines for capital planning and assessing capital adequacy. A
BHC’s scenario design

processes and approaches for estimating the impact of stress on its capital position are comprehensively reviewed to ensure that projections reflect the impact of appropriately stressful
conditions, as well as risks idiosyncratic to the BHC, on its capital position. Significant deficiencies in a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes may result in a qualitative objection by the Federal Reserve to its capital plan.

From a quantitative perspective, the Federal Reserve considers whether under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including the
supervisory severely adverse scenario, the company would be able to maintain throughout each quarter of the nine quarter planning horizon, even if it maintained its base case planned capital actions, projected regulatory risk-based and leverage
capital ratios that exceed the minimums that are, or would then be, in effect for the company, taking into account the Basel III capital rules and any applicable

phase-in

periods. Failure to meet a minimum
regulatory risk-based or leverage capital requirement on a projected stress basis is grounds for objection to a BHC’s capital plan. In addition, the Federal Reserve evaluates a company’s projected path towards compliance with the Basel III
regulatory capital framework on a fully implemented basis.

In connection with the 2017 CCAR exercise, we must file our capital plan and
stress testing results using financial data as of December 31, 2016 with the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2017. We expect to receive the Federal Reserve’s response (either a

non-objection

or
objection) to the capital plan submitted as part of the 2017 CCAR in June 2017.

As part of the CCAR and annual DFAST processes, both we and
the Federal Reserve release certain revenue, loss and capital results from their stress testing exercises. For the 2017 exercises, the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to publish its supervisory revenue, loss and capital projections for
participating BHCs under the supervisory adverse and severely adverse macro-economic scenarios using the common assumptions concerning capital distributions established by the Federal Reserve in its DFAST regulations (DFAST capital action
assumptions), as well as capital ratio information using the company’s proposed base case capital actions. Within 15 days after the Federal Reserve publishes its DFAST results, we also are required to publicly disclose our own estimates of
certain capital, revenue and loss information under the same hypothetical supervisory severely adverse macro-economic scenario and applying the DFAST capital action assumptions.

Federal Reserve regulations also require that we and other large BHCs conduct a separate,

mid-cycle

stress test using financial data as of June 30 and three
company-derived macro-economic scenarios (base, adverse and severely adverse) and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario. For the 2017

mid-cycle

stress test cycle, we must publish
our results in the period between October 5 and November 4, 2017.

The Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule provides that a BHC must resubmit a new capital plan prior to
the annual submission date if, among other things, there has been or will be a material change in the BHC’s risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. Under the “de minimis” safe
harbor of the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, we may make limited repurchases of common stock or other capital distributions in amounts that exceed the amounts included in our most recently approved capital plan subject to certain
conditions, including that the Federal Reserve does not object to the additional repurchases or distributions. Such distributions may not exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of Tier 1 capital for the CCAR 2016 planning period, and 0.25% of Tier 1 capital
for the CCAR 2017 planning period and thereafter.

In September 2016, Governor Daniel Tarullo of the Federal Reserve outlined in a speech
additional changes that the Federal Reserve is considering to its capital plan rule and the CCAR process, including the establishment of a new “stress capital buffer”. Governor Tarullo indicated that such potential changes would be issued
for public comment at a later date and, accordingly, the precise nature of these additional potential changes is not known at this time.

Basel III Liquidity and Other Requirements

. The Basel III framework adopted by the Basel Committee included short-term liquidity standards
(Liquidity Coverage Ratio or LCR) and long-term funding standards (Net Stable Funding Ratio or NSFR).

The rules adopted by the U.S. banking
agencies to implement the LCR took effect on January 1, 2015. The LCR rules are designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA) to meet estimated net
liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions prescribed in the rules (net cash outflow). A company’s LCR is the amount of its HQLA, as defined and calculated in accordance with the haircuts and
limitations in the rule, divided by its net cash outflow, with the quotient expressed as a percentage.

Top-tier

BHCs (like PNC) that are subject to the advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes, as well as
any subsidiary depository institution of such a company that has $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets (such as PNC Bank), are subject to the full LCR (rather than the less stringent modified LCR). The minimum required ratio under
the Full LCR was subject to a

phase-in

schedule, with the minimum in 2016 being 90%, increasing to the fully

phased-in

minimum of 100% effective January 1, 2017.
Effective July 1, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank were required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis. An institution required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis must promptly provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the
minimum if its LCR is below the minimum for three consecutive business days.

The Federal Reserve has adopted a rule that requires large BHCs, including PNC, to publicly disclose
certain quantitative and qualitative measures of their

LCR-related

liquidity profile. These disclosures include major components used to calculate the LCR (e.g., HQLA, cash outflows and inflows for the
consolidated parent company), and a qualitative discussion of the BHC’s LCR results, including, among other things, key drivers of the results, composition of HQLA and concentration of funding sources. We will be required to make these
disclosures starting with the second quarter of 2018.

The NSFR is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and liabilities
of banking organizations over a

one-year

time horizon. The Basel Committee, in October 2014, released the final NSFR framework. In April 2016, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC requested comment on proposed
rules that would implement the NSFR in the United States. The proposed rules would require a covered BHC to calculate its NSFR as the ratios of its available stable funding (ASF) and its required stable funding (RSF) amount, each as defined in the
proposed rules, over a

one-year

horizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all covered banking organizations is 100 percent. For BHCs with assets of $50 billion or more, but less than
$250 billion, and

on-balance

sheet foreign exposure of less than $10 billion, the RSF amount is scaled by a factor of 70 percent. The proposal also includes requirements for quarterly
quantitative and qualitative NSFR disclosures. The requirements of the proposed rules would take effect January 1, 2018. The comment period on the proposed rules closed on August 5, 2016. Although the impact on us will not be fully known
until the rules are final, we have taken several actions to prepare for implementation of the NSFR and we expect to be in compliance with the NSFR requirements when they become effective.

The Federal Reserve also has adopted new liquidity risk management requirements for BHCs with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets (like PNC). These rules require covered BHCs to, among
other things, conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the BHC’s

30-day

liquidity
stress test, and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets detailed requirements.

For additional discussion of regulatory liquidity
requirements, please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends

. The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from PNC Bank. PNC
Bank is subject to various restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent, which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of PNC. PNC Bank is also subject to federal laws limiting extensions of credit to its parent
holding company and

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

non-bank

affiliates as discussed in Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Further
information on bank level liquidity and parent company liquidity and on certain contractual restrictions is also available in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, and in Note 10
Borrowed Funds and Note 15 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Federal Reserve rules
provide that a BHC is expected to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks if necessary. Dodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve jointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the
FDIC to implement this source of strength requirement. These joint rules have not yet been proposed. Consistent with the “source of strength” policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking,
a BHC generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the
corporation’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating in the 2017 CCAR, discussed above, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects capital plans submitted in
2017 to reflect conservative dividend payout ratios and net share repurchase programs, and that requests that imply common dividend payout ratios above 30% of projected

after-tax

net income available to common
shareholders will receive particularly close scrutiny.

The Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided guidance regarding incentive and other
elements of compensation provided to executives and other employees at financial services companies they regulate, both as general industry-wide guidance and guidance specific to select larger companies, including PNC. Acting under provisions of
Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC and two other regulatory agencies have jointly proposed regulations to, among other things, prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk-taking.
These regulations were initially proposed in 2011 and

re-proposed

in 2016 and have not been finalized, with the timing of final adoption and the form of any final regulations uncertain. Regulation of
compensation provided by us to our executives and other employees, whether through guidance or rules and regulations, could hamper our ability to attract and retain quality employees.

Additional Powers Under the GLB Act

. The GLB Act permits a qualifying BHC to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in, or affiliate with financial companies
engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a BHC. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by

the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be
“complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000. In order to be and remain a financial holding company, a BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions must be “well
capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, a financial holding company generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new activity, if any of its insured
depository institutions received a less than Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct merchant
banking activities and securities underwriting and dealing activities. As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our

non-bank

subsidiaries are generally allowed to conduct new financial
activities, and we are generally permitted to acquire

non-bank

financial companies that have less than $10 billion in assets, with

after-the-fact

notice to the Federal Reserve.

In addition,
the GLB Act permits qualifying national banks to engage in expanded activities through the formation of a “financial subsidiary.” PNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance
agency activities through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity by the Secretary of the Treasury,
in consultation with the Federal Reserve (other than insurance underwriting activities, insurance company investment activities and merchant banking). In order to have a financial subsidiary, a national bank and each of its depository institution
affiliates must be and remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, a financial subsidiary generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new
financial activity, if the national bank or any of its insured depository institution affiliates received a less than Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation under the CRA.

If a financial holding company or a national bank with a financial subsidiary fails to continue to meet the applicable “well capitalized” or “well managed” criteria, the financial
holding company or national bank must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among other things, identifies how the capital or management deficiencies will be corrected. Until such deficiencies are
corrected, the relevant agency may impose limits or conditions on the activities of the company or bank, and the company or bank may not engage in, or acquire a company engaged in, the types of expanded activities only permissible for a financial
holding company or financial subsidiary without prior approval of the relevant agency.

Volcker Rule

.

In December 2013, the U.S. banking agencies, SEC and CFTC issued final
rules to implement the “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank. The Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and restrictions generally became effective on July 21, 2015. The rules prohibit banks and their affiliates (collectively, banking
entities) from trading as principal on a short-term basis in securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments, but also include several important exclusions and exemptions from this prohibition. These exclusions and exemptions, for
example, permit banking entities, subject to a variety of conditions and restrictions, to trade as principal for securities underwriting, market making and risk-mitigating hedging purposes, and to trade in U.S. government and municipal securities.
We currently do not expect the proprietary trading aspects of the final rules to have a material effect on our businesses or revenue. However, the limits and restrictions of the Volcker Rule could, depending on the agencies’ approach to
interpreting the rules, cause us to forego engaging in hedging or other transactions that it would otherwise undertake in the ordinary course of business and, thus, to some extent, may limit our ability to most effectively hedge our risks, manage
our balance sheet or provide products or services to our customers.

The rules also prohibit banking entities from acquiring and retaining
ownership interests in, sponsoring, and having certain relationships with private funds (such as, for example, private equity and hedge funds) that would be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 but for the
exemptions in sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that act (covered funds). Again there are exemptions from these restrictions which themselves are subject to a variety of conditions. Moreover, the rules prohibit banking entities from engaging in
permitted trading or covered fund activities if the activity would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties, result in a material exposure by the banking entity to
a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy, or pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States. Banking entities, like PNC, that have $50 billion or more in total assets
are required to establish and maintain an enhanced compliance program designed to ensure that the entity complies with the requirements of the final rules.

In July 2016, the Federal Reserve, exercising authority granted by the Volcker Rule, granted all banking entities until July 21, 2017 to conform their investments in, and relationships with, covered
funds that were held or existed prior to December 31, 2013 (legacy covered funds) to the requirements of the Volcker Rule. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to provide banking entities up to an additional 5 years to conform investments
in and other relationships with covered funds that qualify as “illiquid funds” under the Volcker Rule and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulation. In February 2017, PNC received such an additional 5 year period, ending on
July 21, 2022, to conform or divest its interests in approximately $300 million illiquid legacy covered funds.

Other Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision

. Laws and regulations limit the
scope of our permitted activities and investments. The federal banking agencies also possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured depository institution and its holding company, and the Federal Reserve and the
OCC have the ability to take enforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank, respectively, to prevent and remedy acts and practices that the agencies determine to be unfair or deceptive.

Moreover, examination ratings of “3” or lower, lower capital ratios than peer group institutions, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors, can all
potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends, or to continue to conduct existing activities. The OCC, moreover, has
established certain heightened risk management and governance standards for large banks, including PNC Bank, as enforceable guidelines under section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). The guidelines, among other things, establish
minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework, describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, internal audit, and the board of directors, and
provide that a covered bank should have a comprehensive written statement that articulates its risk appetite and serves as a basis for the framework (a risk appetite statement). If the OCC determines that a covered national bank is not in compliance
with these or other guidelines established under section 39 of the FDI Act (including the guidelines relating to information security standards), the OCC may require the bank to submit a corrective action plan and may initiate enforcement action
against the bank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or the bank fails to comply with an approved plan.

Sections 23A and 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulation, Regulation W, place quantitative and qualitative restrictions on covered transactions between a bank and its affiliates (for example between PNC Bank, on the one hand, and
PNC and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the other hand). In general, section 23A and Regulation W limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and any single affiliate to 10 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus,
limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and all its affiliates to 20 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing

low-quality

assets from an
affiliate, and require certain covered transactions to be secured with prescribed amounts of collateral. Section 23B generally requires that transactions between a bank and its affiliates be on terms that are at least as favorable to the bank as the
terms that would apply in comparable transactions between the bank and a third party. Dodd-Frank amended section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include as a covered transaction the credit exposure of a

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



bank to an affiliate arising from a derivative transaction with the affiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to propose rules to implement these revisions.

The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, to acquire
direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or consolidate with any other BHC. The BHC Act and other federal law enumerates the factors the Federal Reserve must consider
when reviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks, or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or BHC. These factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial
resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the United States; the organizations’ compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations;
the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the records of performance under the CRA of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is also required, and similar
factors are considered, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a savings association or savings and loan holding company, or to merge or consolidate with a savings and loan holding
company. In cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. Under Dodd-Frank, a BHC is generally prohibited from merging or consolidating
with, or acquiring, another company if the resulting company’s liabilities upon consummation would exceed 10% of the aggregate liabilities of the U.S. financial sector (including the U.S. liabilities of foreign financial companies). In
extraordinary cases, the FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, could order the

break-up

of financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States.
OCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to acquire another insured bank or savings association by merger or to acquire deposits or substantially all of the assets of such institutions. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, the OCC
is required to consider factors similar to those that must be considered by the Federal Reserve in connection with the acquisition of a bank or BHC. Approval of the FDIC is required to merge a nonbank entity into PNC Bank. Our ability to grow
through acquisitions or reorganize our operations could be limited by these approval requirements.

At December 31, 2016, PNC Bank had an
“Outstanding” rating with respect to the CRA.

Based on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal
Reserve has indicated that it considers BlackRock to be a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act due to PNC’s current and historical ownership interest in, and other relationships with, BlackRock and, thus, subject to the supervision and
regulation of the Federal Reserve.

FDIC Insurance and Related Matters

. PNC Bank is insured by the FDIC and subject to deposit
premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based.” Therefore, higher fee percentages would be charged to banks that
have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the primary banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings
of assets or liabilities classified as higher risk by the FDIC. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that
of competing banks in a lower risk category.

Federal banking laws and regulations also apply a variety of requirements or restrictions on
insured depository institutions with respect to brokered deposits. For instance, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, brokered deposits are
generally subject to higher outflow assumptions than other types of deposits for purposes of the LCR.

Dodd-Frank mandated an increase in the
Designated Reserve Ratio (the balance in the Deposit Insurance Fund divided by estimated insured deposits) from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and required that insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total
assets, such as PNC, bear the cost of the increase. As a result, the FDIC adopted rules that impose a deposit insurance assessment surcharge (Surcharge) on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more
(including PNC Bank), which became effective on July 1, 2016. The Surcharge will continue in effect until the reserve ratio reaches 1.35 percent (estimated by the FDIC to occur before the end of 2018).

Recovery and Resolution Planning

. Dodd-Frank requires BHCs that have $50 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, to periodically
submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress.
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not credible or would not
facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable resolution framework), and additionally could require the company to divest assets or take other actions if the company did not submit an
acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. The FDIC also requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, to periodically submit a resolution plan to the FDIC that includes, among other
things, an analysis of


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


how the institution could be resolved under the FDI Act in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. Depending on how
the agencies conduct their review of the resolution plans submitted by PNC and PNC Bank, these requirements could affect the ways in which PNC structures and conducts its business and result in higher compliance and operating costs. PNC and PNC Bank
are required to submit their next resolution plans by December 31, 2017.

The OCC has adopted final enforceable guidelines under section
39 of the FDI Act that establish standards for recovery planning for insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, including PNC Bank. These guidelines require a covered bank to develop and maintain a
recovery plan that, among other things, identifies a range of options that could be undertaken by the covered bank to restore its financial strength and viability should identified triggering events occur. For PNC Bank the compliance date for these
guidelines is January 1, 2018. The recovery plan guidelines are enforceable in the same manner as the other guidelines the OCC has established under section 39 of the FDI Act.

CFPB Regulation and Supervision

. Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB authority to examine PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations,
including the laws and regulations that relate to deposit products, credit card, mortgage, automobile and other consumer loans, and other consumer financial products and services we offer. The CFPB also has the power to issue regulations and take
enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, and to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or
service. In addition to these authorities, on July 21, 2011, and pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the CFPB assumed authorities under other consumer financial laws in effect on that date governing the provision of consumer financial products and
services.

The CFPB has engaged in extensive rulemaking activities, including adopting comprehensive new rules on mortgage related topics
required under Dodd-Frank, including borrower

ability-to-repay

and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards and loan originator compensation standards.
In October 2015, broad new regulations took effect that substantially revised the disclosures we provide to prospective residential mortgage customers. These regulations, among other things, require the provision of new disclosures near the time a
prospective borrower submits an application and three days prior to closing of a mortgage loan. The CFPB is also engaged or expected to engage in rulemakings that impact products and services offered by PNC Bank, including regulations affecting
prepaid cards, overdraft fees charged on deposit accounts and arbitration and class-action waiver provisions included in customer account agreements. If adopted, it is possible that CFPB regulations in

these or other areas could reduce the fees that we receive, alter the way we provide our products and services, or expose us to greater private litigation risks.

Securities and Derivatives Regulation

Our registered broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.

Several of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and may provide investment advisory services to clients, other of our
affiliates or related entities, including registered investment companies.

Broker-dealer subsidiaries are registered with the SEC and subject
to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related regulations. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is the primary self-regulatory organization for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Investment adviser
subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related regulations. Our investment adviser subsidiary that serves as adviser to registered investment companies is also subject to the requirements of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and related regulations. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.

Over the past several years, the SEC and other regulatory agencies have increased their focus on the asset management, mutual fund and broker-dealer industries. Congress and the SEC have adopted
regulatory reforms and are considering additional reforms that have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, the extent of regulation of the mutual fund, investment adviser and broker-dealer industries and impose additional compliance
obligations and costs on our subsidiaries involved with those industries. Under provisions of the federal securities laws applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers and registered investment companies and their service providers, a
determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and
an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations also can affect our ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a
broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and
disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.

Title VII of Dodd-Frank imposes comprehensive and significant regulations on the activities of
financial institutions that are active in the U.S.

over-the-counter

derivatives and

Form 10-K



foreign exchange markets. Title VII was enacted to (i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures
and protection to customers, and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, Title VII: (i) requires the registration of both “swap dealers” and “major swap participants” with one or both of the CFTC (in the case
of non security-based swaps) and the SEC (in the case of security-based swaps); (ii) requires that most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility;
(iii) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and margin requirements in excess of historical practice; (iv) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to comprehensive new recordkeeping and real-time public
reporting requirements; (v) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to new business conduct requirements, including the provision of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties

(pre-execution)

the material risks, material incentives, and any conflicts of interest associated with their swap; (vi) imposes special duties on swap dealers and major swap participants when transacting
a swap with a “special entity” (

e.g.

, governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment); and (vii) effective March 1, 2017, will impose variation margin requirements
on swaps that are not centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house.

As PNC Bank is registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC, it is
subject to the regulations and requirements imposed on registered swap dealers, and the CFTC (and for certain delegated responsibilities, the National Futures Association) has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank’s derivatives
and foreign exchange businesses. Because of the limited volume of our security-based swap activities, PNC Bank has not registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. The regulations and requirements applicable to swap dealers will
collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on PNC Bank and introduces additional legal risks (including as a result of newly applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action).

BlackRock has subsidiaries in securities and related businesses subject to SEC, other governmental agencies, state, local and FINRA regulation, and a
federally chartered nondepository trust company subsidiary subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC. For additional information about the regulation of BlackRock by these agencies and otherwise, we refer you to the discussion under the
“Regulation” section of Item 1 Business in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form

10-K,

which may be obtained electronically at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Regulations of Other Agencies

In
addition to regulations issued by the federal banking, securities and derivatives regulators, we also are subject to regulations issued by other federal agencies with respect to

certain financial products and services we offer. For example, certain of our fiduciary and investment management activities are subject to regulations issued by the Department of Labor (DOL)
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and certain of our student lending and servicing activities are subject to regulation by the Department of Education. The DOL has issued final rules expanding the
definition of “investment advice” related to retirement accounts and certain other accounts that are subject to DOL interpretive authority. The rule will increase the scope of activities that give rise to fiduciary status under ERISA and
the Internal Revenue Code. The rules, which will primarily apply to aspects of our retail and asset management business lines, require new disclosures, development of policies and procedures, and contractual obligations for some account types, among
other things. The rules are currently scheduled to take effect on April 10, 2017 with a transition period between April 10, 2017 and January 1, 2018 during which time reduced requirements apply. Full compliance is currently required
on January 1, 2018. A presidential memorandum issued on February 3, 2017 directed the DOL to review the rules to determine whether, among other things, the rules harm investors or increase costs. In a statement issued that same day, the
DOL indicated that it is considering its legal options to delay the rules’ applicability date. Whether and how these developments may impact the April 10, 2017 applicability date remains unclear.

ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS

We are subject to a
number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the
business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.

Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our
business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. We categorize the risks we face as credit, liquidity, capital, market (including interest rate, trading, and investment risk), operational (including
operations, compliance (including legal), data management, model, technology and systems, information security, business continuity, and third party risk), strategic and reputational. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in
appropriate places, related historical performance and other metrics in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.

The following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, including those described below. These risk factors and other risks we face are also discussed further in other sections of this
Report.

Difficult economic conditions or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

As a financial services company, our business and overall financial performance are
vulnerable to the impact of poor economic conditions. Poor economic conditions generally result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the demand for our products and services, can impair the ability of borrowers to repay loans, and may
lead to turmoil and volatility in financial markets. Such effects would likely have an adverse impact on financial institutions such as PNC, with the significance of the impact generally depending on the severity of the adverse or recessionary
economic conditions.

Even when economic conditions are relatively good or stable, specific economic factors can negatively affect the
performance of financial institutions. For example, low commodity prices in the energy sector had an impact in 2016, particularly during the early part of the year.

Political factors can also impact our business through changes in customer behavior or in the types of transactions we seek to pursue, in response to economic instability or market volatility or to
proposed or adopted changes in governmental policy resulting from events such as changes in control of Congress, the election of a new President or political events outside the United States that impact the U.S. economy or our customers. In the
recent past, uncertainty regarding the ability of Congress and the President collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary, taxing and spending matters has also created the risk of economic instability or market volatility. Proposed changes
in law and policy accompanying the new presidential administration create the possibility of significant impacts on business activity in the United States and globally and provide uncertainty pending efforts to enact them. The impact of such
political factors can have an adverse effect on our performance together with that of others in the industry.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Significant business tax reform is being considered by the new administration and Congress, with a number
of proposals having been made. The proposals thus far generally seek to broaden the tax base by eliminating certain deductions and credits in favor of providing lower tax rates for all businesses. It is unknown what specific deductions or credits
might be eliminated and it is uncertain the extent corporate tax rates might be reduced. Changes to deductions, credits, and rates could have a material impact on us, either directly or by changing the behavior of our customers.

Given the geographic scope of our business and operations, we are most exposed to problems within the United States economy and financial markets and,
within the United States, most exposed to issues in our primary geographic footprint concentrated in the Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern United States.

International economic conditions, however, can impact our business and financial performance both directly to the extent of our international business activities and, possibly more significantly,
indirectly due to the possibility that poor economic conditions impacting other major economies around the world will have an impact on the United States. For example, a repetition of concerns such as those arising out of the financial crisis of
2007-2009 related to the solvency of several European countries could have an adverse effect on financial markets throughout the world, including those relevant to our business. Currently, the prospect of the United Kingdom’s impending exit
from the European Union has led to uncertainty regarding the impact on the United Kingdom’s economy and capital markets as well as that of the remaining countries in the European Union. It is also possible that other countries might seek to
exit the European Union in the future. The extent to which these uncertainties will affect the United States economy and capital markets is unclear.

Other risk factors, presented below, address specific ways in which we may be adversely impacted by economic conditions.

Our business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.

Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions
and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and securities and the importance of lending activity to our overall
business. We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties, by diversifying our loan portfolio and by investing primarily in high quality securities. Many factors impact credit risk.

A borrower’s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by several factors, such as business performance, job losses or

health issues. A weak or deteriorating economy and changes in the United States or global markets also could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. Any decrease
in our borrowers’ ability to repay loans would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.

Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to
many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other
institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.

Despite
maintaining a diversified loan and securities portfolio, in the ordinary course of business, we may have concentrated credit exposure to a particular person or entity, industry, region or financial market. Loans secured by commercial and residential
real estate represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio as well as of the assets underlying our investment securities. Events adversely affecting specific customers or counterparties, industries, regions or financial markets,
including a decline in their creditworthiness or overall risk profile, could adversely affect us.

Our credit risk may be exacerbated when
collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.

We reserve for credit losses through our Allowance for loan and lease losses, with changes in the Allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in Net
income through Provision for credit losses. An increase in credit risk would likely lead to an increase in Provision for credit losses with a resulting reduction in our Net income and would increase our Allowance for loan and lease losses.

Our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax
and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, over which we have no control, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance.

As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in
interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:

•

Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay
on liabilities, which impacts our overall net interest income and profitability.

•

Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in
turn, affect our loss rates on those assets.

•

Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.

•

Such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in
helping to manage such risks.

•

Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the
profitability of such assets.

•

Increases in interest rates can lower the price we would receive on fixed-rate customer obligations if we were to sell them.

Governmental monetary, tax and other policies, including those of the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on
interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as PNC. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national
supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of our

on-balance

sheet and

off-balance

sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, the
Federal Reserve’s policies also significantly influence our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial
results. The very low interest rate environment that has prevailed since the financial crisis has had a negative impact on our ability to increase our net interest income. Although the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate in
December 2015 and again in December 2016, ending approximately seven years of near zero rates, and is expected to continue raising rates through 2017, there is no assurance that it will do so. The failure on the part of the Federal Reserve to
continue raising rates could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us in addition to continuing to affect our net interest income. Even if the Federal Reserve continues to increase the interest rates it directly
influences, there may be a prolonged period before interest rates return to more historically typical levels.

In addition, monetary and
fiscal policy actions by governmental and regulatory decision makers in other countries or in the European Union could have an impact on global interest rates, affecting rates in the United States as well as rates on instruments denominated in
currencies other than the United States dollar, any of which could have one or

more of the potential effects on us described above. While we have not experienced negative interest rates in the United States, some central banks in Europe and Asia have cut interest rates
below zero. It is unclear what the impact of these actions will be. If U.S. interest rates were to fall below zero, it could significantly affect our businesses and results of operation.

Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.

As a financial institution, a substantial majority of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature (items such as loans, securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings). Such assets and
liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in question. Credit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in
value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of borrowers or other counterparties and also due to changes in market interest rates.

In addition, changes in loan prepayment speeds, usually based on fluctuations in market interest rates, could adversely impact the value of our mortgage
servicing rights. Additionally, the underlying value of assets under lease or securing an obligation may decrease due to supply and demand for the asset or the condition of the asset. This could cause our recorded lease value or the value of the
secured obligation to decline.

In many cases, we mark our assets and liabilities to market on our financial statements, either through our
Net income and Retained earnings or through adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet. We may need to record losses in the value of financial assets even where our expectation of realizing the face value of the
underlying instrument has not changed.

In addition, asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets
being managed and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income.

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services, which may be negatively impacted by a lack of
consumer and business economic confidence as well as our actions, including our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer demands for products and services.

As a financial institution, our performance is subject to risks associated with the loss of customer confidence and demand. Economic and market developments may affect consumer and business confidence
levels. If customers lose confidence due to a weak or deteriorating economy or uncertainty surrounding


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


the future of the economy, the demand for our products and services could suffer. We may also fail to attract or retain customers if we are unable to develop and market products and services that
meet evolving customer needs or demands or if we are unable to deliver them effectively and securely to our customers, particularly to the extent that our competitors are better able to do so.

News or other publicity that impairs our reputation, or the reputation of our industry generally, also could cause a loss of customers. Financial
companies are highly vulnerable to reputational damage when they are found to have harmed customers, particularly retail customers, through conduct that is illegal or viewed as unfair, deceptive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful.

If we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans and other financial products and services could decrease and we could experience adverse
changes in payment patterns. We could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and fee income from a decline in product sales, investments and other transactions. Our customers could remove money from checking and savings accounts and
other types of deposit accounts in favor of other banks or other types of investment products. Deposits are a low cost source of funds. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income.

The United States is just starting to emerge from an extended period of very low interest rates. Very low interest rates decrease the attractiveness of
alternatives to bank checking and savings accounts, which may lack deposit insurance and some of the convenience associated with more traditional banking products and which may no longer be able to offer much higher interest rates. If interest rates
were to rise significantly, customers may be less willing to maintain balances in

non-interest

bearing or low interest bank accounts, which could result in a relatively higher cost of funds to us. This could
also result in a loss of fee income.

In our asset management business, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of
assets that we manage. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might
diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to
a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on
our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.

As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and the
financial services industry as a whole continues to be subject to significant regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and elsewhere.

PNC is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company and is subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both its business and organization.

Our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple banking, consumer protection, securities and derivatives regulatory bodies. In recent years, we,
together with the rest of the financial services industry, have faced intense regulation, with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory bodies. Legislatures and regulators have pursued
a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection. As a result, we have
experienced significantly increased compliance costs and have needed to adjust our business practices to accommodate new requirements and limitations, impacting some of our revenue opportunities. We expect these effects to continue.

Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from subsidiaries that operate in the banking and
securities businesses and impose capital adequacy requirements. PNC’s ability to service its obligations and pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on the receipt of dividends and advances from its subsidiaries, primarily PNC Bank.
The Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its
shareholders or creditors.

Applicable laws and regulations also restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with
provisions designed to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We are also subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering,
terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities.

Although the new
presidential administration has indicated an intent to pursue the regulation of the financial services industry differently than was the case under the previous administration, there is significant uncertainty regarding the direction this
presidential administration will take and its ability to implement its policies and objectives, as well as the ultimate impact on potential new regulatory initiatives and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



There are currently pending numerous additional regulatory proposals, and other new initiatives are likely
to be pursued in the future. The implementation of new regulatory requirements and limitations could further increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with

non-compliance

and could affect our
ability to pursue or take full advantage of some desirable business opportunities.

A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and
procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory actions or consequences, such as limitations on activities otherwise permissible for us or additional
requirements for engaging in new activities, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.

See
Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for more information concerning the regulation of PNC and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, including some of the matters discussed in this Risk Factor. Note 18
Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report also discusses some of the regulation applicable to us.

Current and likely future capital and liquidity standards will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically
been the case.

We are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, and
discuss these requirements and standards in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report and the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

The regulatory capital requirements applicable to banks and BHCs have undergone, and continue to undergo, significant changes. For example, the final
rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 to implement the new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital established by the Basel Committee known as “Basel III,” as well as to implement certain provisions of
Dodd-Frank, fundamentally altered the U.S. regulatory capital requirements for U.S. BHCs and banks. Significant parts of these rules are now effective for us, although as a result of the staggered effective dates of the rules many provisions are
being

phased-in

over a period of years, with the rules generally to be fully

phased-in

as of January 1, 2019. The Basel Committee, moreover, continues to consider
additional, significant changes to the international capital framework for banking organizations, including modifications that would significantly alter the international frameworks governing the market risk capital requirements for trading
positions and the standardized risk weighting approach for credit risk, establish a capital floor for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches

for the risk weighting of assets, modify the framework for operational risk under the advanced approaches, modify the treatment of securitization positions, and seek to enhance the transparency
and consistency of capital requirements amongst banks and jurisdictions. It is unclear how these or other initiatives by the Basel Committee may be finalized and implemented in the United States and, thus, we are unable to estimate what potential
impact such initiatives may have on us.

The liquidity standards applicable to large U.S. banking organizations also are expected to be
supplemented in the coming years. For example, the Basel Committee, in October 2014, released the final framework for the NSFR standard, which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation
to their asset composition and

off-balance

sheet activities. Under that framework, the NSFR would take effect as a minimum regulatory standard on January 1, 2018. In May 2016, the U.S. banking agencies
proposed rules to implement the NSFR but these rules have not yet been finalized. Thus, the potential impact of the rules on us remains unclear.

The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required could limit our business activities, including lending, and our
ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in us taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders, being limited in our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to
shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets, for which the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets’ underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity standards require us to maintain holdings of highly liquid
short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased
in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as
dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. In addition, PNC, as a BHC that is subject to the advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes, is subject to a higher LCR requirement than other BHCs that have more than
$50 billion in total assets but are not subject to the advanced approaches. Until the scope and terms of pending or future rulemakings relating to capital, liquidity, or liability composition are known, the extent to which such rules may apply
to us and the potential impact of such rules on us will remain uncertain.

We operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms of the
products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our labor markets where we compete for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.

We are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in many similar activities
without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is described in Item 1 of this Report under “Competition.” Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of
financial services companies, in connection with current industry conditions or otherwise.

In all, the principal bases for competition are
pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest-bearing deposits), product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer
needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to
deliver the products and services that customers desire and in a manner that they find convenient and attractive. Banks generally are facing the risk of increased competition from products and services offered by non-bank financial technology
companies, particularly related to payment services and lending.

Another increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry
is the competition to attract and retain talented employees across many of our business and support areas. This competition leads to increased expenses in many business areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business opportunities.
Limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions can compensate their officers and employees may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions to compete with unregulated financial institutions for talent.

A failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our
businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate
sensitive businesses, pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income.

We depend on the effectiveness and integrity of our employees, systems and controls to manage operational risks.

We are a large organization that offers a wide variety of products to a broad and diverse group of customers. We are dependent on our employees, systems, and controls to assure that we properly enter
into, record and manage processes,

transactions and other relationships with customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business, as well as to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in these
relationships.

We necessarily rely on our employees or, in some cases, employees of third parties to perform these tasks and manage the
resulting risks. As a result, we are vulnerable to human error, misconduct or malfeasance, leading potentially to operational breakdowns or other errors. In addition, when we change processes or procedures or introduce new products or services, we
may fail to adequately identify or manage operational risks resulting from such changes. We have taken measures to manage and mitigate this risk, but our controls may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from human involvement in our
business, including risks associated with the design, operation, and monitoring of automated systems.

Errors by our employees or those of
third parties, whether accidental, intentional or fraudulent, or other failures of our systems and controls could result in customer remediation costs, regulatory fines or penalties, litigation or enforcement actions, or limitations on our business
activities. They also could result in damage to our reputation and to our ability to attract and retain customers, with the reputational impact likely greater to the extent that the mistakes or failures are pervasive, long-standing or affect a
significant number of customers, particularly retail consumers.

It is not possible to prevent all errors of these types, particularly to the
extent that human activity is involved, and over the last several years, other financial services organizations have been reported to have failed to prevent, identify or respond to a broad range of operational risk matters with resulting
consequences to the other organizations of these types described above. Recent examples include unauthorized account openings, assessment of inappropriate fees, and failure to report information timely to the government.

We depend on technology, both internally and through third-parties, to conduct our business and could suffer a material adverse impact from
interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, those systems.

As a large financial company, we handle a
substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions on a continuous basis. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, and monitor our transactions and those of our customers. Over
time, we have increased substantially in size, scope and complexity. We have also seen more customer usage of technological solutions for financial needs and higher expectations of customers and regulators regarding effective and safe systems
operation. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. The need to ensure proper functioning and resiliency of these systems has become more challenging, and the costs involved in that effort are greater than ever.

The risks to these systems result from a variety of factors, both internal and external. In some cases,
these factors relate to the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, foreign governments or their agents, employees and others, and to some extent will be beyond our ability to prevent. In other cases, our systems could fail to
operate as needed, including failures to prevent access in an unauthorized manner, due to factors such as design or performance issues, human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or inadequate measures to protect against unauthorized access or
transmissions. We are also at risk for the impact of natural or other disasters, terrorism, international hostilities and the like on our systems or for the effect of outages or other failures involving power, communications, or payment, clearing
and settlement systems operated by others. In addition, we face a variety of types of cyber attacks, some of which are discussed in more detail below. Cyber attacks often include efforts to disrupt our ability to provide services or to gain access
to, or destroy, confidential or proprietary company and customer information.

We rely on other companies for the provision of a broad range
of products and services. Many of these products and services include information systems or involve the use of such systems in connection with providing the products or services. In some cases, these other companies provide the infrastructure that
supports communications, payment, clearing and settlement systems, or information processing and storage. These other companies are generally subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our systems. To the extent we rely on these other
companies, we could be adversely affected if they are impacted by system failures, cyber attacks or employee misconduct.

All of these types
of events, whether resulting from cyber attacks or other internal or external sources, expose customer and other confidential information to security risks. They also could disrupt our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems
and could cause errors in transactions or system functionality with customers, vendors or other parties.

In addition, our customers often use
their own devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us and may provide their PNC customer information (including passwords) to a third party in connection with obtaining services from the third party. Although we take
steps to provide safety and security for our customers’ transactions with us and their customer information to the extent they are utilizing their own devices or providing third parties access to their accounts, our ability to assure such
safety and security is necessarily limited.

We are faced with ongoing efforts by others to breach data security at financial institutions or
with respect to financial transactions. Some of these involve efforts to enter our systems directly by going through or around our security protections. Others involve the use of schemes such as “phishing” to gain access to identifying
customer information, often from customers themselves. Most corporate and commercial

transactions are now handled electronically, and our retail customers increasingly use online access and mobile devices to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with us in this manner
depends on the transmission of confidential information, which increases the risk of data security breaches.

In addition, individuals or
organizations sometimes flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, in what is referred to as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process
transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. Starting in late 2012, we and other financial services companies were subject to DDoS attacks, although no customer data has been lost or
compromised to this point as a result of such attacks against us, and they have not had a material impact on us. More recently, several major DDoS attacks outside of the US financial services industry have demonstrated an evolution in scope and
potential impact of such attacks, including coupling them with other types of attacks and enhancing their impact by exploiting vulnerabilities in “Internet of Things” devices. Although we have made improvements in our security posture with
respect to such attacks, we cannot provide assurance that future attacks of this type, or attacks of other types, might not have a greater effect on us, particularly given the evolution in the maliciousness and scale of recent attacks.

As our customers regularly use

PNC-issued

credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other
businesses, there is the risk of data security breaches at those other businesses covering PNC account information. When our customers use

PNC-issued

cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account
information may be provided to the business. If the business’s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach, holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on
their card accounts. We may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers’ card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards
associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, we provide card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Under these agreements, we may be
responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach.

Over the last few years,
several large companies disclosed that they had suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials. To date, our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material, but other similar
events in the future could be more significant to us.

There have been other recent publicly announced cyber attacks that were not focused on
gaining access to credit card


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


or user credential information but instead sought access to a range of other types of confidential information including internal emails and other forms of customer financial information.
Ransomware attacks have sought to deny access to data and possibly shut down systems and devices maintained by target companies. In a ransomware attack, system data is encrypted or access is otherwise denied, accompanied by a demand for ransom to
restore access to the data. To date, we have not been impacted financially by these types of attacks, but attacks on others demonstrate the risks to confidential information and systems operations potentially posed by new and evolving types of cyber
attacks.

Methods used by others to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication), often are not
recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to address these methods in
advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventive measures.

In addition to threats from people external to us, insider
threats represent a significant risk to us. Insiders, having legitimate access to our systems and the information contained in them, have the easiest opportunity to make inappropriate use of the systems and information. Addressing that risk requires
understanding not only how to protect us from unauthorized use and disclosure of data, but also how to engage behaviorial analytics to identify potential internal threats before any damage is done.

We have policies, procedures and systems (including business continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures,
interruptions or breaches in security of information systems. We design our business continuity and other information and technology risk management programs to manage our capabilities to provide services in the case of an event resulting in
material disruptions of business activities affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. We regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance these policies, procedures and systems. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee the
effectiveness of our policies, procedures and systems to protect us in any particular future situation.

Our ability to mitigate the adverse
consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business continuity planning, our ability to understand threats to us from a holistic perspective, and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that
occurs. The adverse impact of natural and other disasters, terrorist activities, international hostilities and the like could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional governments, including
emergency responders, or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal, particularly those on which we depend, some of which we have little or no control over.

In recent years, we have incurred significant expense towards improving the reliability of our systems and
their security against external and internal threats. Even with our proactive and defensive measures in place, there remains the risk that one or more adverse events might occur. If one does occur, we might not be able to remediate the event or its
consequences timely or adequately, particularly to the extent that it represents a novel or unusual threat. To the extent that the risk relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit
the risk, but here, as well, we cannot eliminate it. Should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur, we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect
us from the consequences.

The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our information or communications systems,
or the systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to us. This risk is greater if the issue is widespread or results in financial losses to our customers. Possible adverse consequences include
damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or
reimbursement of customers adversely affected by a systems problem or security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or systems failures at other financial
institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions, including us. Also, systems problems, including those resulting from third party attacks, whether at PNC or at our competitors, would likely increase
regulatory and customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and security of such systems generally. In that case, we would expect to incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks.

We continually encounter technological change and we could falter in our ability to remain competitive in this arena.

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and
services. Examples at the present time include expanded use of cloud computing, biometric authentication, data protection enhancements, and increased

on-line

and remote device interaction with customers. The
effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. We have been investing in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually, to
facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise to enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. On the retail side, this has included developments such as

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



more sophisticated ATMs and expanded access to banking transactions through the internet, smart phones, tablets and other remote devices. These efforts have all been in response to actual and
anticipated customer behavior and expectations. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands, including demands for
faster and more secure payment services, and create efficiencies in our operations. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our
technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, may cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense.

There are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.

We rely on
quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks,
predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the
risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or
implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the
models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.

Our asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount
of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets are highly subjective. Inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.

We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of
financial statement volatility. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, it may
be more difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become
illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any

particular market could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements.

The determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the
respective asset class. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and
asset impairments, due to the substantial subjective nature of this area, there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore,
additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.

Our business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings.

Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some
cases from the activities of companies we have acquired). In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related
to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, mortgage lending, servicing, sales,
securitization and other aspects of the mortgage business have been a significant contributor to our overall legal risk, which may continue going forward, particularly given additional borrower protections provided as part of regulatory initiatives
to reform the mortgage industry. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.

Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that
a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the
outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss
contingencies. We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

We grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services companies or assets from time to
time, and these acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.

Acquisitions of other financial services companies, financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to us in
addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired.

In general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive or take
longer to complete than anticipated (including unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company). Anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, for example resulting from being
able to offer product sets to a broader potential customer base) may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events.

Our ability to achieve anticipated results from acquisitions is often dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and
the extent of deposit attrition, which are, in part, related to the state of economic and financial markets.

Also, litigation and
governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of the acquisition or be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to us. Note 19 Legal
Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes several legal proceedings related to

pre-acquisition

activities of companies we have acquired, including
National City. Other such legal proceedings may be commenced in the future.

Integration of an acquired company’s business and operations
into PNC, including conversion of the acquired company’s different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to the acquired company’s or our
existing businesses. In some cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks and uncertainties in instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas.

Our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for
integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the target, which is more limited than the information we have regarding companies we already own.

As a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition
opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. In addition, our ability to make large acquisitions in the future may be negatively impacted by regulatory rules or future regulatory initiatives designed to
limit systemic risk and the potential for a financial institution to become “too big to fail.”

Our business and financial
performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.

Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions, pandemics, dislocations, fires, explosions, and other
catastrophic accidents or events), terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from
conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters,
terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that
could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.

Our ability to
mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist
activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with,
particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.

PART II

ITEM 5 – MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

(a) (1) Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is traded under the symbol “PNC.” At the close of business on
February 16, 2017, there were 60,763 common shareholders of record.

Holders of PNC common stock are entitled to receive dividends when
declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for this purpose. Our Board of Directors may not pay or set apart dividends on the common stock until dividends for all past dividend periods on any series of outstanding preferred
stock and certain outstanding capital securities issued by the parent company have been paid or declared and set apart for payment. The Board of Directors presently intends to continue the policy of paying quarterly cash dividends. The amount of any
future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, our financial condition and operating results, and other factors, including contractual restrictions and applicable government regulations and policies (such as those relating to the
ability of bank and

non-bank

subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company and regulatory capital limitations). The amount of our dividend is also currently subject to the results of the supervisory
assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve and our primary bank regulators as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process as described in the Supervision and Regulation
section in Item 1 of this Report.

The Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit us from paying dividends without its approval. For
further information concerning dividend restrictions and other factors that could limit our ability to pay dividends, as well as restrictions on loans, dividends or advances from bank subsidiaries to the parent company, see the Supervision and
Regulation section in Item 1, Item 1A Risk Factors, the Capital and Liquidity Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7, and Note 10 Borrowed Funds, Note 15 Equity and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which we include here by reference.

We include here by reference additional information
relating to PNC common stock under the Common Stock Prices/Dividends Declared section in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report.

We include here by reference the information regarding our compensation plans under which PNC equity
securities are authorized for issuance as of December 31, 2016 in the table (with introductory paragraph and notes) that appears in Item 12 of this Report.

Our stock transfer agent and registrar is:

Computershare Trust Company, N.A.

250 Royall Street

Canton, MA 02021

800-982-7652

Registered shareholders may contact this phone number regarding dividends and other shareholder services.

We include here by reference the information that appears under the Common Stock Performance Graph caption at the end of this Item 5.

(a)(2)

None.

(b)

Not applicable.

(c)

Details of our repurchases of PNC common stock during the fourth quarter of 2016 are included in the following table:

In thousands, except per share data

(a)

Includes PNC common stock purchased in connection with our various employee benefit plans generally related to forfeitures of unvested restricted stock awards and
shares used to cover employee payroll tax withholding requirements. Note 11 Employee Benefit Plans and Note 12 Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report include additional information
regarding our employee benefit and equity compensation plans that use PNC common stock.

(b)

On March 11, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the establishment of a stock repurchase program authorization in the amount of
100 million shares of PNC common stock, effective April 1, 2015. Repurchases are made in open market or privately negotiated transactions and the timing and exact amount of common stock repurchases will depend on a number of factors
including, among others, market and general economic conditions, regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, and contractual and regulatory limitations, including the results of the
supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process.

In June 2016, we announced share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four quarter period beginning with the third quarter of 2016, including
repurchases of up to $200 million related to employee benefit plans. In January 2017, we announced a $300 million increase in our share repurchase programs for this period. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased 4.9 million
shares of common stock on the open market, with an average price of $101.47 per share and an aggregate repurchase price of $.5 billion. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report for
more information on the share repurchase programs under the share repurchase authorization for the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017 included in the 2016 capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve.

Common Stock Performance Graph

This graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return (

i.e.

, price change plus reinvestment of dividends) on our common stock during the
five-year period ended December 31, 2016, as compared with: (1) a selected peer group as set forth below and referred to as the “Peer Group;” (2) an overall stock market index, the S&P 500 Index; and (3) a published
industry index, the S&P 500 Banks. The yearly points marked on the horizontal axis of the graph correspond to December 31 of that year. The stock performance graph assumes that $100 was invested on January 1, 2012 for the five-year
period and that any dividends were reinvested. The table below the graph shows the resultant compound annual growth rate for the performance period.

Fifth Third Bancorp; KeyCorp; The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.; SunTrust Banks, Inc.; U.S. Bancorp; Regions Financial Corporation; Wells Fargo & Company; Capital One Financial Corporation; Bank of America Corporation; M&T Bank

Each yearly point for the Peer Group is determined by calculating the cumulative total shareholder return for each company in the Peer Group from
December 31, 2011 to December 31 of that year (End of Month Dividend Reinvestment Assumed) and then using the median of these returns as the yearly plot point.

In accordance with the rules of the SEC, this section, captioned “Common Stock Performance Graph,” shall not be incorporated by reference into any of our future filings made under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933. The Common Stock Performance Graph, including its accompanying table and footnotes, is not deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.

(a)

Includes assets and liabilities for which we have elected the fair value option. See Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

(b)

Includes balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland of $25.1 billion, $30.0 billion, $31.4 billion, $11.7 billion and
$3.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(c)

Includes our equity interest in BlackRock.

(d)

Includes long-term borrowings of $38.3 billion, $43.6 billion, $41.5 billion, $27.6 billion and $19.3 billion for 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively. Borrowings which mature more than one year after December 31, 2016 are considered to be long-term.

(e)

As a result of certain investment advisory services performed by one of our registered investment advisors, certain assets are reported as both discretionary client
assets under management and nondiscretionary client assets under administration. The amount of such assets was approximately $9 billion, $6 billion, $5 billion, $4 billion and $4 billion at December 31, 2016, 2015,
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(f)

Calculated as taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially
exempt from federal income tax. As such, these

tax-exempt

instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we use net interest
income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on

tax-exempt

assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable
investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $.2 billion, $.2 billion,
$.2 billion, $.2 billion and $.1 billion, respectively. For additional information, see Statistical Information (unaudited) in Item 8 of this Report.

(g)

Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(h)

See capital ratios discussion in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 and in the Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this
Report for additional discussion on these capital ratios.

(i)

See additional information on the pro forma ratios, the 2015 Transitional Basel III ratio and Basel I ratios in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item
8 of this Report.

(j)

Pro forma ratios as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were calculated under the standardized approach
and the pro forma ratio as of December 31, 2012 was calculated under the advanced approaches. The 2012 and 2013 ratios have not been updated to reflect the first quarter 2014 adoption of ASU

2014-01

related to investments in low income housing tax credits.

Key Strategic Goals

At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and revenue and improving
profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our commitments to our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities where we do
business.

We strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering a broad range of deposit,

fee-based

and credit products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services to our customers with the goal of addressing their financial objectives and putting customers’ needs
first. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers’ financial goals and offering our diverse products and services to help them achieve financial wellbeing. Our approach is concentrated on
organically growing and deepening client relationships across our lines of business that meet our risk/return measures.

Our strategic
priorities are designed to enhance value over the long term. One of our priorities is to build a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated geographic markets. We are focused on reinventing the retail banking experience by transforming the
retail distribution network and the home lending process for a better customer experience and improved efficiency, and growing our consumer loan portfolio. In addition, we are seeking to attract more of the investable assets of new and existing
clients and we continue to focus on expense management while investing in technology to bolster critical business infrastructure and streamline core processes.

Our capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic conditions and the Basel III framework and return excess capital to
shareholders, in accordance with the currently effective capital plan included in our Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submission to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). For more detail, see the
Capital Highlights portion of this Executive Summary and the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of this Report.

Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance

We face a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors
such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this Report.

Our financial performance is substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following:

•

Domestic and global economic conditions, including the continuity, speed and stamina of the current U.S. economic expansion in general and its impact
on our customers in particular;

•

The monetary policy actions and statements of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC);

•

The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve;

•

The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets;

•

Changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape and in counterparty creditworthiness and performance;

•

The impact of legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives and actions, including the form and timing of any further implementation, or
changes to, certain reforms enacted by the Dodd-Frank legislation;

•

The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations;

•

Asset quality and the ability of customers, counterparties and issuers to perform in accordance with contractual terms;

•

Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit; and

•

Customer demand for

non-loan

products and services.

In addition, our success will depend upon, among other things:

•

Effectively managing capital and liquidity including:

•

Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a

low-cost

stable funding source;

•

Prudent liquidity and capital management to meet evolving regulatory capital, capital planning, stress testing and liquidity standards; and

•

Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets.

•

Managing credit risk in our portfolio;

•

Execution of our strategic priorities;

•

Our ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment;

•

The impact of legal and regulatory-related contingencies; and

•

The appropriateness of reserves needed for critical accounting estimates and related contingencies.

Business Outlook

Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that
economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our current view that the U.S.
economy and the labor market will grow moderately in 2017, boosted by stable oil/energy prices, improving consumer spending and housing activity, and expanded federal fiscal policy stimulus as a result of the 2016 elections. Short-term interest
rates and bond yields are expected to continue rising in 2017, along with inflation. Specifically, our business outlook reflects our expectation of two 25 basis point increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in June and
December of 2017. See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Item 7 and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

For the full year 2017 compared to full year 2016, we expect:

•

Loan growth to be up

mid-single

digits, on a percentage basis;

•

Revenue to increase

mid-single

digits, on a percentage basis;

•

Purchase accounting accretion to decline $75 million;

•

Noninterest expense to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis; and

•

The effective tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%, absent any tax reform.

In 2017, we expect quarterly other noninterest income to be between $250 million to $275 million, excluding debt securities gains and net Visa
activity.

For the first quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect:

•

Modest loan growth;

•

Stable net interest income;

•

Fee income to decrease by

mid-single

digits, on a percentage basis, mainly attributable to seasonality and
lower first quarter client activity. Fee income consists of asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits;

•

Provision for credit losses to be between $75 million and $125 million; and

•

Noninterest expense to decrease by low single digits, on a percentage basis.

Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report.

Net income for 2016 was $4.0 billion, or $7.30 per diluted common share, a decrease of 4% compared with $4.1 billion, or $7.39 per diluted
common share, for 2015. The decrease was driven by higher provision for credit losses and a 3% decline in noninterest income, partially offset by 1% increase in net interest income.

(a)

Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal
income tax. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest
margins by increasing the interest income earned on

tax-exempt

assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the
Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report.

Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of
interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net
Interest Analysis and Analysis Of

Year-To-Year

Changes In Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this Report.

Net interest income increased $113 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared with 2015 due to increases in loan and securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by an increase in borrowing
costs and lower securities yields.

Average investment securities increased due to higher average agency residential mortgage-backed
securities and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, partially offset by a decrease in average

non-agency

residential mortgage-backed securities.

Total investment securities increased to 23% of average interest- earning assets in 2016 compared to 20% in 2015.

The increase in average loans was driven by growth in average commercial real estate loans of $3.6 billion and average commercial loans of $2.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease in
consumer loans of $2.6 billion. The decline in consumer loans was primarily attributable to declines in the nonstrategic consumer and government guaranteed education loan portfolios. Loans represented 66% of average interest-earning assets in
2016 and 2015.

Average interest-bearing deposits increased $8.8 billion primarily due to higher average savings deposits, which largely
reflected a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products, as well as higher average interest-bearing demand deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased to 77% of average interest-bearing liabilities in 2016
compared to 74% in 2015.

Noninterest Income

Table 2: Noninterest Income

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 45% for 2016 and 46% for 2015.

Asset management revenue decreased mainly due to lower earnings from BlackRock and the impact from a $30 million trust settlement in 2015 in our
asset management business segment. Discretionary client assets under management in the Asset Management Group were $137 billion at December 31, 2016 compared with $134 billion at December 31, 2015.

Consumer service fees increased primarily from growth in payment-related products including debit card and credit card, as well as higher brokerage fees.

Corporate service fees increased reflecting higher treasury management fees and a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights
valuation, net of economic hedge, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.

Other noninterest income decreased
primarily attributable to the impact of lower net gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares and lower revenue from private equity investments. Net gains on the sale of Visa shares for 2016 were $32 million compared with
$166 million in 2015. Net gains on Visa sales include derivative fair value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date.

Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Further details
regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Further details regarding private and other equity
investments are included in the Market Risk Management – Equity and Other Investment Risk section, and further details regarding gains or losses related to our equity investment in BlackRock are included in the Business Segments Review
section of this Item 7.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses increased to $433 million in 2016 compared with $255 million in 2015, primarily attributable to a higher provision for energy related loans in the oil, gas, and
coal sectors. Additionally, overall credit portfolio performance and loan growth contributed to the higher provision.

The Credit Risk
Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.

Noninterest Expense

Table 3: Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased slightly in the comparison to the prior year as we continued to focus on disciplined
expense management. The increase reflected higher 2016 contributions to the PNC Foundation, a new FDIC deposit insurance surcharge and investments in technology and business infrastructure mostly offset by net lower contingency accruals.

During 2016, we completed actions and achieved our 2016 continuous improvement program savings goal of $400 million, which largely funded our
investments in technology and business infrastructure. In 2017, we have a goal of $350 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which we expect will substantially fund our 2017 business and technology investments.

Effective Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate was 24.1% for 2016 compared with 24.8% for 2015. The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive from our
investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments. The decline in the comparison reflected the tax favorability of the 2016 PNC Foundation contributions.

•

Total assets increased primarily due to higher investment securities and loan balances, partially offset by lower interest-earning deposits with banks.

•

Higher total liabilities were driven by deposit growth.

•

The increase to total equity reflected increased retained earnings driven by net income, partially offset by share repurchases.

(c)

Collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed education loans and other consumer credit products.

(d)

Includes state and municipal securities.

(e)

Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities.

Investment securities increased $5.4 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31,
2015. Growth in investment securities was driven by net purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agencies and agency residential mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by prepayments of

non-agency

commercial mortgage-backed and

non-agency

residential mortgage-backed securities.

Table 6 presents
the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, which could affect
our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction
or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.

At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level
impairment assessment on all securities. If economic conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to
increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement.

The duration of investment securities was 3.0 years at December 31, 2016. We estimate that at
December 31, 2016 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.9 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable
amounts at December 31, 2015 for the effective duration of investment securities were 2.8 years and 2.6 years, respectively.

Based on
expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stock and other) was 5.0 years at December 31, 2016 compared to 4.8 years at December 31, 2015.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our 2016 capital and
liquidity activities.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2016 grew $1.0 billion compared to December 31, 2015 due to an increase in retained earnings and higher capital surplus, which included
the issuance of Series S preferred stock, partially offset by common share repurchases of $2.0 billion and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily related to net unrealized securities losses. The growth in retained
earnings resulted from 2016 net income of $4.0 billion, reduced by $1.3 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. Common shares outstanding were 485 million and 504 million at December 31, 2016, and
December 31, 2015, respectively, reflecting repurchases of 22.8 million shares during 2016.

Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 22 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Certain amounts
included in this Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 differ from those amounts shown in Note 22, primarily due to the presentation in Item 7 of this Report of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Note 22 presents
results of businesses for 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing
methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors. In the first quarter of 2015,
enhancements were made to our funds transfer pricing methodology primarily for costs related to the new regulatory short-term liquidity standards. The enhancements incorporate an additional charge assigned to assets, including for unfunded loan
commitments. Conversely, a higher transfer pricing credit has been assigned to those deposits that are accorded higher value under Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules for liquidity purposes. Please see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item
1 and the Liquidity and Capital Management section in this Item 7 for more information about the LCR. These adjustments affected business segment results, primarily favorably impacting Retail Banking and adversely impacting Corporate &
Institutional Banking.

(a)

Presented as of December 31, except for customer-related statistics, which are averages for the year ended, and net charge-offs, which are for the year ended.

(b)

Percentage of total consumer and business banking deposit transactions processed at an ATM or through our mobile banking application.

(c)

Represents consumer checking relationships that process the majority of their transactions through

non-teller

channels.

(d)

Includes nonperforming loans of $1.0 billion at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

(e)

Excludes satellite offices (

e.g.

,

drive-ups,

electronic branches and retirement centers) that provide limited products
and/or services.

(f)

Included in total branches; represents branches operating under our universal model.

(g)

Includes cash and money market balances.

Retail Banking earned $1.0 billion in 2016 compared with $907 million for 2015. The increase in
earnings was driven by higher net interest income and a decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by lower noninterest income and increased provision for credit losses. Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with
refinements to product offerings that drive product value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products.

Retail Banking continued to focus on the strategic priority of transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch network
transformation and multi-channel engagement and service strategies.

•

In 2016, approximately 58% of consumer customers used

non-teller

channels for the majority of their
transactions compared with 52% for 2015.

•

Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 49% of total deposit transactions in 2016 compared with 43% for 2015.

•

We had a network of 2,520 branches and 9,024 ATMs at December 31, 2016. Approximately 21% of the branch network operates under the universal
model.

•

Instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print a customer’s debit card in minutes, was available in 2,207 branches, or 88% of the branch
network, as of December 31, 2016.

Net interest income increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to growth in deposit
balances partially offset by lower loan balances and interest rate spread compression on the value of loans and deposits.

The decline in
noninterest income compared to the prior year reflected the impact of lower net gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares in 2016 of $32 million compared with net gains of $166 million in 2015. Net gains on Visa sales include
derivative fair value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa Class B common shares in connection with all prior sales to date.

Other forms of noninterest income grew in the comparison, reflecting execution on our strategy to provide diverse product and service offerings. Higher transaction volumes in 2016 contributed to consumer
service fee growth from payment-related products, specifically in debit and credit card, as well as increased service charges on deposits and brokerage fees.

The decline in noninterest expense in the comparison was due to a decrease in personnel expense, lower marketing expense,

and reduced branch network expenses as a result of network transformation and transaction migration to lower cost digital and ATM channels.

Provision for credit losses increased compared to 2015, reflecting overall credit portfolio performance.

The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on
market specific deposit growth strategies, and providing a source of

low-cost

funding and liquidity to PNC. In 2016, average total deposits increased compared to 2015, driven by growth in savings deposits
reflecting in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Additionally, demand deposit categories increased, partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit due to the net runoff of maturing accounts.

Retail Banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy. The decrease in average total loans in 2016 compared to 2015 was
due to a decline in home equity and commercial loans, as well as runoff of certain portions of the portfolios, as more fully described below.

•

Average home equity loans decreased as

pay-downs

and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated volume. Retail
Banking’s home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with over 97% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. The weighted-average updated FICO scores for this portfolio were 746 at December 31,
2016 and 752 at December 31, 2015.

•

Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined as

pay-downs

and payoffs on loans exceeded new
volume.

•

Average automobile loans, which consisted of both direct and indirect auto loans, increased primarily due to portfolio growth in previously
underpenetrated markets.

•

Average credit card balances increased as a result of organic growth.

•

In 2016, average loan balances for the education and other loan portfolios declined $988 million, or 11%, compared to 2015, driven by declines in
the discontinued government guaranteed education, indirect other, and residential mortgage portfolios, which are primarily runoff portfolios.

Nonperforming assets decreased compared to December 31, 2015 driven by declines in both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans.

(h)

Includes nonperforming loans of $.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and $.4 billion at December 31, 2015.

Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $2.0 billion in both 2016 and 2015. Earnings
remained stable as higher revenue was offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses. We continue to focus on building client relationships with appropriate risk-return profiles.

Net interest income increased modestly compared with 2015, reflecting the impacts of higher average loans and interest rate spread expansion on deposits, as well as interest rate spread compression on
loans.

Growth in noninterest income in the comparison was driven by higher treasury management fees, an equity investment gain in 2016,
increased fees from underwriting activities and higher structuring fees on asset securitizations. These increases were partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.

Overall credit quality in 2016 remained relatively stable, except for deterioration related to certain energy related loans, which was the primary driver for the increase in provision for credit losses,
net charge-offs and nonperforming assets in the year over year comparisons. Increased provision for credit losses also reflected the impact of continued loan growth.

Noninterest expense increased nominally in the comparison reflecting disciplined expense management.

Average loans increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to strong growth in Real Estate:

•

PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Higher average loans for
this business were primarily due to growth in both commercial real estate and commercial lending.

•

Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to midsized and large corporations,
government and

not-for-profit

entities. Average loans for this business increased slightly in the comparison, reflecting increased lending to large corporate clients
mostly offset by the impact of capital and liquidity management activities.

•

PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured
by short-term assets. Average loans for this business increased in the comparison due to new originations.

•

PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment financing solutions for clients throughout the U.S. and Canada. Average loans, including commercial loans and
finance

leases, and operating leases were $11.9 billion in 2016, compared with $11.8 billion in 2015.

Average deposits increased modestly compared with 2015, as growth in other deposits, driven by interest-bearing demand deposit growth, was mostly offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits
and money market deposits.

Growth in the commercial loan servicing portfolio was reflected by servicing additions from new and existing
customers exceeding portfolio

run-off.

Product Revenue

In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury
management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income,
corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is
reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 10 includes the consolidated revenue for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.

Treasury management revenue consists of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances. Compared with 2015, revenue from treasury management
increased driven by liquidity-related revenue associated with customer deposit balances and interest rate spread expansion.

Capital
markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. Revenue from capital markets-related products and
services decreased slightly in the comparison as both lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and loan syndication fees were mostly offset by increased fees from underwriting activities and higher structuring fees on asset securitizations.

Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and
noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total commercial mortgage banking activities increased marginally in the comparison as a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing
rights valuation, net of economic hedge, was mostly offset by lower revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Asset Management Group earned $210 million in 2016 compared to $194 million in 2015. Earnings
increased due to declines in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, as well as an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income.

The decline in revenue in the comparison was driven by lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income. The decline in noninterest income reflected the impact from a
$30 million trust settlement in 2015, which was partially offset by new sales production and stronger average equity markets. Increased net interest income in the comparison was primarily due to higher average deposit balances, partially offset
by a decrease in loan balances.

The reduction in noninterest expense in 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to lower
compensation expense. Asset Management Group remains focused on disciplined expense management as it invests in strategic growth opportunities.

Asset Management Group’s strategy is focused on growing investable assets by continually evolving the client experience and products and services.
The business offers an open architecture platform with a full array of investment products and banking solutions. Key growth opportunities include:

maximizing front line productivity, ensuring a relationship-based approach with other lines of business partners, and optimizing market presence across our footprint.

Wealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100 offices operating in seven out of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority

co-located

with retail banking branches. The businesses provide customized investments, wealth planning, trust and estate administration and private banking solutions to affluent individuals and ultra-affluent
families.

Institutional Asset Management provides advisory, custody, and retirement administration services to institutional clients such as
corporations, unions, municipalities,

non-profits,

foundations, and endowments. The business also offers PNC proprietary mutual funds and investment strategies. Institutional Asset Management is strengthening
its partnership with Corporate & Institutional Banking to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.

The increase in assets under administration in the comparison to the prior year reflected growth in discretionary client assets under management, which was driven by higher equity markets.

Form 10-K



Residential Mortgage Banking earned $85 million in 2016 compared to $26 million 2015. The
increase was primarily driven by a decline in noninterest expense and higher noninterest income.

The business is focused on acquiring new
customers, with an emphasis on home purchase transactions, through a retail loan officer sales force by leveraging our bank footprint and competing on the basis of superior service.

Residential Mortgage Banking overview:

•

Total loan originations increased 1% compared to 2015. Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under Federal National
Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)/Department of Veterans Affairs agency guidelines. Refinancings were 60% of originations in 2016 and 55% in 2015.

•

Lower net interest income was primarily due to reduced loans held for sale and portfolio loan balances as well as compressed interest rate margins.

•

Higher noninterest income was driven by increased servicing fee income.

•

Noninterest expense declined primarily as a result of lower legal reserves and residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses.

Non-Strategic

Assets Portfolio overview:

•

Lower net interest income resulted primarily from the impact of the declining average balance of the loan portfolio.

•

The reduced benefit from provision for credit losses was driven by higher releases of reserves in 2015.

•

Noninterest expense declined driven by lower costs of managing and servicing the loan portfolios as they continue to decline.

•

Average loans decreased mainly due to customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under-performing assets.

Consolidated Income Statement Review

Summary Results

Net income for 2015 of $4.1 billion, or $7.39 per diluted common share, decreased compared to 2014 net income of $4.2 billion, or $7.30 per
diluted common share. A decrease in revenue of 1% was partially offset by reductions in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses. Lower revenue was driven by a 3% decrease in net interest income, offset in part by a 1% increase in
noninterest income reflecting strong fee income growth.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $8.3 billion in 2015 and decreased by $247 million, or 3%, compared with 2014 due to lower purchase accounting accretion and lower interest-earning asset yields driven by
the low rate environment, partially offset by commercial and commercial real estate loan growth and higher securities balances. The decline also reflected the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility
fees from net interest income to noninterest income.

Net interest margin was 2.74% in 2015 and 3.08% in 2014. The decrease was driven by a 32
basis point decline in the yield on total interest-earning assets, which was principally due to the impact of increasing the company’s liquidity position, lower loan and securities yields, and lower benefit from purchase accounting accretion.
The decline also included the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees.

Noninterest
Income

Noninterest income was $6.9 billion for 2015 and 2014, as strong growth in consumer and corporate services fees and asset
management revenue was partially offset by lower gains on asset sales and lower residential mortgage revenue. Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 46% for 2015, up from 45% for 2014.

Asset management revenue increased $54 million, or 4%, in 2015 to $1.6 billion, compared to 2014, driven by new sales

production and stronger average equity markets, as well as the benefit from a $30 million trust settlement in 2015. Discretionary client assets under management in the Asset Management Group
were $134 billion at December 31, 2015 compared with $135 billion at December 31, 2014.

Consumer service fees increased
$81 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to growth in customer-initiated transaction volumes related to debit card, credit card and merchant services activity, along with higher brokerage revenue.

Corporate service fees increased to $1.5 billion in 2015 compared to $1.4 billion in 2014, driven by higher treasury management, commercial
mortgage servicing and equity capital markets advisory fees, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees. The increase also reflected the impact of the correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest
income to noninterest income beginning in the second quarter of 2014.

Residential mortgage revenue decreased to $566 million in 2015
from $618 million in 2014, primarily due to lower loan sales and servicing revenue, partially offset by higher net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights.

Other noninterest income decreased to $1.3 billion in 2015 compared to $1.4 billion in 2014. The decline was primarily attributable to lower gains on asset dispositions, including the impact of
the 2014 gain of $94 million on the sale of our Washington, D.C. regional headquarters building and lower net gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares.

Net gains on sales of Visa Class B Common shares were $166 million in 2015 compared to $150 million in 2014. Net gains on Visa sales include derivative fair value adjustments related to
swap agreements with purchasers of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date.

Provision For Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses totaled $255 million in 2015 compared with $273 million in 2014, reflecting improved credit quality.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense
decreased $25 million to $9.5 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting our focus on expense management. Higher personnel expense associated with higher business activity and investments in technology and business infrastructure were
more than offset by lower legal and residential mortgage compliance costs and third party expenses, as well as the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 contribution to the PNC Foundation.

During 2015, we completed actions and exceeded our 2015 continuous improvement program goal of $500 million in cost

savings. The program focused on reducing costs in part to fund investments in technology and business infrastructure.

Effective Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate was 24.8% for 2015 compared with
25.1% for 2014. The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.

The effective tax rate for 2015 included tax benefits attributable to settling acquired entity tax contingencies.

Consolidated Balance Sheet Review

Summary Results

Our balance sheet
reflected asset growth and strong liquidity and capital positions at December 31, 2015. Total assets increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of $14.7 billion in investment securities driven by deposit growth. Total
liabilities increased in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in deposits. Total equity in 2015 remained relatively stable compared to 2014 mainly due to increased retained earnings driven by net income, offset by share repurchases and
redemption of preferred stock.

Loans

Loans increased $1.9 billion to $206.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014. Loan growth was the result of an increase in total commercial lending driven by
commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer lending due to lower home equity, education and automobile loans.

Average total loans increased by $5.7 billion to $205.3 billion in 2015, which was driven by increases in average commercial loans of
$5.7 billion and average commercial real estate loans of $2.5 billion. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans of $2.4 billion primarily attributable to lower home equity and education loans, which
included declines in the

non-strategic

consumer loan portfolio.

Investment Securities

Investment securities increased $14.7 billion to $70.5 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014, due
to deposit growth. The majority of increases were in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities.

Average investment securities increased to $61.7 billion during 2015 compared to $55.8 billion during 2014, primarily due to increases in average agency residential mortgage-backed securities
and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, partially offset by a decrease in average

non-agency

residential mortgage-backed securities.

The weighed-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stock and
other) was 4.8 years at December 31, 2015 and 4.3 years at December 31, 2014.

Funding Sources

Total deposits increased $16.8 billion to $249.0 billion at December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014 due to strong growth in
savings, demand and money market deposits, partially offset by a decline in retail certificates of deposit.

Average total deposits increased
$17.4 billion to $240.4 billion in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to increases in average money market deposits, average

non-interest-bearing

deposits and average interest-bearing demand
deposits driven by both commercial and retail deposit growth.

Total borrowed funds decreased $2.2 billion to $54.5 billion at
December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014, as declines in commercial paper, federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements and subordinated debt were partially offset by higher net issuances of bank notes and senior debt.

Average borrowed funds increased to $56.5 billion in 2015 from $48.8 billion in 2014 primarily due to an increase in average FHLB
borrowings and average bank notes and senior debt. These increases were partially offset by a decline in average commercial paper balances. The changes in the composition of funding sources were attributable to our actions to enhance our funding
structure in light of regulatory liquidity standards and a rating agency methodology change.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity increased $159 million to $44.7 billion at December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014, mainly
due to a $2.8 billion increase in retained earnings, partially offset by common share repurchases of $2.1 billion and the redemption of $500 million of preferred stock. The increase in retained earnings was driven by net income of
$4.1 billion, reduced by $1.3 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. Common shares outstanding were 504 million and 523 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

ANAGEMENT

Enterprise Risk Management

We have an Enterprise Risk Management Framework which is
structurally aligned with enhanced prudential standards that establish minimum requirements for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework. We encounter risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. Accordingly, we
design risk management processes to help manage this risk. We manage risk in light of our Risk Appetite to optimize long-term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers, and communities.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



This Risk Management section describes our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework which consists of
risk culture, enterprise strategy (including Risk Appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing), risk governance and oversight, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and
reporting. The overall Risk Management section of this Item 7 also provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance. Our use of financial
derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the risk management section.

We
operate within a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. Accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely adoption of regulatory pronouncements within our ERM Framework.

We view risk management as a cohesive combination of the following risk elements which form our ERM Framework:

Risk Culture

A strong risk culture helps us make well-informed decisions, ensures individuals conform to the established culture, reduces an individual’s ability to do something for personal gain, and rewards
employees working toward a common goal rather than individual interests. Our risk culture reinforces the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior. These protocols are especially critical in terms of our risk awareness, risk-taking
behavior and risk management practices.

Managing risk is every one of our employee’s responsibility. All of our employees individually
and collectively assume responsibility for ensuring the organization is performing with the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management practices and is striving to achieve our stated objectives rather than pursuing individual interests. All
employees are responsible for understanding our Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM Framework and how risk management applies to their respective roles and responsibilities.

Employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks, and elevate issues as required. We reinforce risk management responsibilities through a performance
management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to reinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.

Proactive communication, between groups and up to the Board of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of risk issues. Our multi-level risk committee structure provides a formal
channel to identify, decision, and report risk.

Enterprise Strategy

We ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within acceptable risk parameters through Risk Appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing processes. These components are reviewed
and approved at least annually by the Board of Directors.

Risk Appetite

: Our risk appetite represents the
organization’s desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. The Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement qualitatively describes the aggregate level
of risk we are willing to accept in order to execute our business strategies. Qualitative guiding principles further define each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. Risk Appetite metrics and limits, including
forward-looking metrics, quantitatively measure whether we are operating within our stated Risk Appetite. Our Risk Appetite metrics reflect material risks, align with our established Risk Appetite Framework, balance risk and reward, leverage
analytics, and adjust in a timely manner to changes in the external and internal risk environments.

Strategic
Planning

: Our enterprise and line of business strategic plans outline major objectives, strategies, and goals which are expected to be achieved over the next five years while seeking to ensure we remain compliant with all capital, Risk Appetite,
and liquidity targets and guidelines. Our CEO and CFO lead the development of the strategic plan, the strategic objectives, and the comprehensive identification of material risks that could hinder successful implementation and execution of
strategies. Strategic planning is linked to our risk management and capital planning processes.

Capital Planning and
Stress Testing

: Capital planning helps to ensure we are maintaining safe and sound operations and viability. The capital planning process and the resulting capital plan evolve as our overall risks, activities, and risk management practices
change. Capital planning aligns with our strategic planning process.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


Stress testing is an essential element of the capital planning process. Effective stress testing enables us to consider the estimated effect on capital of various hypothetical scenarios.

Risk Governance and Oversight

We employ a comprehensive risk management governance framework to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced decisions are made that consider risk
and return, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. Risk committees established within this risk governance and oversight framework provide oversight for risk management activities at the Board of Directors, executive, corporate, and
business levels. Committee composition is designed to provide effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense in accordance with the OCC’s heightened risk management and governance expectations and guidelines. See discussion of
the enhanced prudential standards in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report.

To ensure the appropriate risks are
being taken and effectively managed and controlled, risk is managed across three lines of defense. The Board’s and each line of defense’s responsibilities are detailed below:

Board of Directors

–

The Board of Directors oversees our risk-taking activities and
exercises sound, independent judgment when assessing risk.

First line of defense

– The front line units are
accountable for identifying, owning and managing risks to within acceptable levels while adhering to the risk management framework established by Independent Risk Management. Our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control
processes within their areas. Integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks which may significantly impact each business. The manner in which the first line of defense executes
its responsibilities must reflect our risk culture.

Second line of defense

–

The
second line of defense is independent from the first line of defense and is responsible for establishing the standards for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling aggregate risks. As the second line of defense, the independent risk areas
monitor the risks generated by the first line of defense, review and challenge the implementation of effective risk management practices, and report any issues or exceptions. The risk areas help to ensure the first line of defense is properly
designed and operating as intended, and they may intervene directly in modifying and developing first line of defense risk processes and controls

.

Third line of defense

– As the third line of defense, Internal Audit is independent from the first and second lines of defense. Internal audit provides the Board of

Directors and executive management comprehensive assurance on the effectiveness of risk management practices across the organization.

Within the three lines of defense, the independent risk organization has sufficient authority to influence material decisions. Our business oversight and decision-making is supported through a governance
structure at the Board of Directors and management level. Specific responsibilities include:

Board of
Directors

–

Our Board of Directors oversees our business and affairs as managed by our officers and employees. The Board of Directors may receive assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate
authority through the following standing committees:

•

Audit Committee

: monitors the integrity of our consolidated financial statements; monitors internal control over financial reporting; monitors
compliance with our code of ethics; evaluates and monitors the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and evaluates and monitors the performance of our internal audit function and our independent auditors.

•

Nominating and Governance Committee

: promotes our best interests and those of our shareholders through implementation of sound corporate
governance principles and practices.

•

Personnel and Compensation Committee

: oversees the compensation of our executive officers and other specified responsibilities related to
personnel compensation matters affecting us.

•

Risk Committee

: oversees enterprise-wide risk structure and the processes established to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the
organization’s risks and evaluates and approves our risk governance framework.

Corporate
Committees

– The corporate committees are responsible for overseeing risk standards and strategies, recommending risk limits, policies and metrics, monitoring risk exposures, reviewing risk profiles and key risk issues, and
approving significant transactions and initiatives. We have established several senior management-level corporate committees to facilitate the review, evaluation, and management of risk. The management-level Executive Committee is the corporate
committee that is responsible for developing enterprise-wide strategy and achieving our strategic objectives. The Executive Committee evaluates risk management, in part, by monitoring risk reporting from the other corporate committees which are the
supporting committees for the Executive Committee.

Working Committees

– The working committees are
generally subcommittees of the corporate committees. Working committees are intended to assist in the implementation of key enterprise-level activities within a business or function; recommend and/or approve Risk

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Appetite metrics and limits; recommend and/or approve policies that are generally within the standards outlined in the applicable enterprise policy; and review and/or approve certain significant
transactions or initiatives.

Policies and Procedures

– We have established risk management policies
and procedures to provide direction, guidance, and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the Board of Directors. These policies and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by
relevant committees within the governance structure.

We have established risk management policies, programs and procedures to support our ERM
Framework, articulate our risk culture, define the parameters and processes within which employees are to manage risk and conduct our business activities and to provide direction, guidance, and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and
the Board of Directors. These policies, programs and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant committees within the governance structure.

Risk Identification

Risk identification
takes place across a variety of risk types throughout the organization. These risk types consist of, but are not limited to, credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance. Risks are identified based on a balanced use of
analytical tools and management judgment for both

on-

and

off-balance

sheet exposures. Our governance structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment
of key risk issues, emerging risks, and idiosyncratic risks and implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. These risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and assessed against the Risk Appetite. Multiple tools
and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including Risk Appetite Metrics, Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Risk Control and Self-Assessments (RCSAs), scenario analysis, stress testing and special
investigations.

Risks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions or businesses. The aggregated risk information is reviewed
and reported at an enterprise level for adherence to the Risk Appetite framework as established through the policy framework and approved by the Board of Directors or by appropriate committees. This enterprise aggregation and reporting approach
promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to our Risk Appetite.

Risk Assessment

Once risks are
identified, they are evaluated based on quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether they are material. Risk assessments support the overall

management of an effective ERM Framework and allows us to control and monitor our actual risk level through the use of risk measures. Comprehensive, accurate and timely assessments of risk are
essential to an effective ERM Framework. The use of analytical tools and methods help identify and prioritize risks. Effective risk measurement practices will uncover reoccurring risks that have been experienced in the past; make the known risks
easy to see, understand, compare and report; and reveal unanticipated risks that may not be easy to understand or predict.

Risk Controls
and Monitoring

Our ERM Framework consists of policies, processes, personnel, and control systems. Risk controls and limits provide the
linkage from our Risk Appetite Statement and associated guiding principles to the risk taking activities of our businesses. In addition to Risk Appetite limits, a system of more detailed internal controls exists which oversees and monitors our
various processes and functions. These control systems measure performance, help employees make correct decisions, ensure information is accurate and reliable and document compliance with laws and regulations.

Our monitoring and evaluation of risks and controls provides assurance that policies, procedures and controls are effective and also results in the
identification of control improvement recommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily,

on-going

process used by both the first and second line of defense to ensure compliance with our ERM Framework. Risk
monitoring is accomplished in many ways, including performing risk assessments at the prime process and risk assessment unit level, monitoring an area’s key controls, the timely reporting of issues, and establishing a quality assurance and/or
quality control function, as applicable.

Risk Aggregation and Reporting

Risk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i) aggregate risks; (ii) identify concentrations; (iii) help ensure we remain within our established Risk Appetite; (iv) serve as a basis for
monitoring our risk profile in relation to our Risk Appetite and (v) communicate risks to the Board of Directors and executive management.

Risk reports are produced at the line of business, functional risk and the enterprise levels. The enterprise level risk report aggregates risks
identified in the functional and business reports to define the enterprise risk profile. The enterprise risk profile is a

point-in-time

assessment of enterprise risk.
The risk profile represents our overall risk position in relation to the desired enterprise Risk Appetite. The determination of the enterprise risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of risk limits and other measures along with
qualitative assessments. Quarterly aggregation of our risk profile enables a clear view of our risk level relative to our quantitative Risk Appetite. The enterprise level report is provided through the governance structure to the Board of Directors.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


Risk reports are produced at the enterprise level as well as the risk area, line of business, and support
area levels. Each individual risk report includes an assessment of inherent risk, quality of risk management, residual risk, Risk Appetite, and risk outlook. The enterprise risk report includes an aggregate view of risks identified in the individual
report and provides a summary of our overall risk profile compared to our Risk Appetite.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is
inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks.
Our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and
processes, measured and evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific

mitigation activities, to management and the Board of Directors through our governance structure. Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which
ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets. Loans held for sale, certain
government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included
in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. A summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 15. See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further detail of nonperforming asset categories.

As of December 31, 2016, approximately 84% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral
which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of December 31, 2016, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 66% of their unpaid principal balance, due to
charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the ALLL.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 70% of total residential real
estate nonperforming loans at December 31, 2016, up from 68% at December 31, 2015. Home equity TDRs comprise 52% of home equity nonperforming loans at December 31, 2016 and 51% at December 31, 2015. TDRs generally remain in
nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through
Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.

At December 31, 2016, our largest nonperforming asset was $46 million in the Mining, Quarrying,
Oil and Gas Extraction Industry and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was less than $1 million. The ten largest individual nonperforming assets are from the commercial lending portfolio and represented 40% and
11% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.

Loan
Delinquencies

We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset
quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired
loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

2015 driven by declines in government insured residential real estate and other consumer loans. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by
collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified

charge-off

timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed
loans.

Home Equity Loan Portfolio

Our home equity loan portfolio totaled $29.9 billion as of December 31, 2016, or 14% of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, $17.7 billion, or 59%, were outstanding under primarily
variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $12.2 billion, or 41%, consisted of

closed-end

home equity installment loans. Approximately 4% of the home equity portfolio was purchased impaired and 3% of
the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of December 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2016, we were in an originated
first lien position for approximately 55% of the total outstanding

portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we held or serviced the first lien position for an additional 3% of the portfolio. The remaining 42% of the portfolio was secured by second liens
where we do not hold the first lien position. The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien
position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally based upon original LTV at the time of origination. We use an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is
aggregated from public and private sources.

We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original LTVs and updated FICO scores
at least quarterly, updated LTVs semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for internal
reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (

e.g.

, home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit,


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, modification status and
bankruptcy status, as well as the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien).

In establishing our ALLL for

non-impaired

loans, we utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of
loans. The roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state to the next delinquency state and ultimately to

charge-off.

The roll through to

charge-off

is based on our actual loss experience for each type of pool. Each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens. Our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has
been consistent over time and the

charge-off

amounts for the pools, used to establish our allowance, include losses on both first and second lien loans.

Generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a

20-year

amortization term. During the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest only or principal and interest. We view home equity lines of credit where borrowers
are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. The risk associated
with the borrower’s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our ALLL. Based upon outstanding balances at December 31, 2016, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines
of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.

Table 18:

Home Equity Lines of Credit – Draw
Period End Dates

(a)

Includes all home equity lines of credit that mature in 2017 or later, including those with borrowers where we have terminated borrowing privileges.

(b)

Includes home equity lines of credit with balloon payments, including those where we have terminated borrowing privileges, of $35 million, $27 million,
$20 million, $71 million and $416 million with draw periods scheduled to end in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and thereafter, respectively.

Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at December 31, 2016, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (

e.g.

, draw period has
ended or borrowing privileges have been

terminated), approximately 3% were

30-89

days past due and approximately 6% were 90 days or more past due, which are accounted for as nonperforming.
Generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include loan modification resulting
in a loan that is classified as a TDR.

Auto Loan Portfolio

The auto loan portfolio totaled $12.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, or 6% of our total loan portfolio. Of that total, $10.8 billion resides in the indirect auto portfolio,
$1.3 billion in the direct auto portfolio, and $.3 billion in acquired or securitized portfolios, which has been declining as no pools have been recently acquired. Indirect auto loan applications are generated from franchised automobile
dealers. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail business.

We have elected not to pursue

non-prime

auto lending as evidenced by an average new loan origination FICO score during 2016 of 760 for indirect auto loans and 775 for direct auto loans. As of December 31, 2016, .4% of our auto loan
portfolio was nonperforming and .5% of the portfolio was accruing past due. We offer both new and used automobile financing to customers through our various channels. The portfolio was composed of 57% new vehicle loans and 43% used vehicle loans at
December 31, 2016.

The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained
monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type, and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our
overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes, and credit metrics which include FICO score,

loan-to-value

and
term.

Energy Related Loan Portfolio

Our portfolio of loans outstanding in the oil and gas industry totaled $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, or 1% of our total loan portfolio and 2% of our total commercial lending portfolio.
This portfolio comprised approximately $1.0 billion in the midstream and downstream sectors, $.8 billion to oil services companies and $.6 billion to upstream sectors. Of the oil services portfolio, approximately $.2 billion is
not asset-based or investment grade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas sector as of December 31, 2016 totaled $184 million, or 8% of total nonperforming assets.

Our portfolio of loans outstanding in the coal industry totaled $.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, or less than 1% of both our total loan portfolio and our total commercial lending portfolio.
Nonperforming loans in the coal industry as of December 31, 2016 totaled $61 million, or 3% of total nonperforming assets.

Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings

Consumer Loan Modifications

We modify
loans under government and

PNC-developed

programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification
under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend
the term and/or defer principal. Loans that are either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment
arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs.

A temporary modification, with a term between three and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms
for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed.
Permanent modification programs generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest-only period or deferral of principal.

We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our borrowers’
and servicing customers’ needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 19 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.

Table 19:

Consumer Real Estate Related Loan Modifications

Commercial Loan Modifications

Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or
forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial
difficulties.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate
reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court
imposed concessions (

e.g.

a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).

Table 20:

Summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings (a)

(a)

Amounts in table represent recorded investment, which includes the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest and net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs.
Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.

(b)

Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are
excluded from nonperforming loans.

Excluded from TDRs are $1.2 billion of consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted
for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 52% and 53% of
total nonperforming loans, and 50% and 48% of total TDRs at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual accounting after performing under the
restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit

We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated
probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2016 consisted of $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending
categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination
process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and
economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.

We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using
methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and
consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective
interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.

Reserves are established for

non-impaired

commercial loan classes based on probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) credit risk ratings.

Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan
commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower LGD compared
to loans not secured by collateral. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate
and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.

Allocations to

non-impaired

consumer loan classes are primarily based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data
that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately

charge-off.

A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative and measurement factors. These factors may include, but are
not limited to, the following:

•

Industry concentrations and conditions,

•

Recent credit quality trends,

•

Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,

•

Recent macro-economic factors,

•

Model imprecision,

•

Changes in lending policies and procedures,

•

Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and

•

Limitations of available historical data.

Our determination of the ALLL for

non-impaired

loans is sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and loss rates for consumer loans. There are
several other qualitative and quantitative factors considered in determining the ALLL. This sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. It is intended to provide insight into the impact of
adverse changes to risk grades and loss rates only and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given the current processes used, we believe the risk grades and loss rates currently assigned are
appropriate. In the hypothetical event that the aggregate weighted average commercial loan risk grades would experience a 1% deterioration, assuming all other variables remain constant, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by
approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2016. In the hypothetical event that consumer loss rates would increase by 10%, assuming all other variables remain constant, the allowance for consumer loans would increase by approximately
$25 million at December 31, 2016.

Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance
prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our
expectations as of the acquisition date. At December 31, 2016, we had established reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and

non-impaired)

acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition.

In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage
for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in
assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We
report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit
facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use
for determining our ALLL.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
of this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.

At December 31, 2016, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 121%. The comparable amount for December 31,
2015 was 128%. These ratios are 89% and 98%, respectively, when excluding the $.7 billion and $.6 billion of ALLL at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not
secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded from these ratios purchased impaired loans consumer loans and consumer lines of credit not secured by real estate that are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Table
15 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.

The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including
asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During 2016, overall credit quality remained relatively stable despite negative impacts from certain energy related loans, which resulted in an ALLL balance decline
of $138 million, or 5.1% to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.

Residential Mortgage Repurchase Obligations

As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, we have sold residential mortgage loans
directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


While residential mortgage loans are sold on a

non-recourse

basis,
we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors. These loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where we are alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and
representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements. Our historical exposure and activity associated with Agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to
transactions with FNMA and FHLMC, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with FHA and

VA-insured

and uninsured loans pooled in GNMA securitizations historically have been minimal. In addition to
indemnification and repurchase risk, we face other risks of loss with respect to our participation in these programs, some of which are described in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report
with respect to governmental inquiries related to

FHA-insured

loans. Repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment.

Origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity and, accordingly, management continually assesses the need to recognize
indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements. We establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or
for loans that are expected to be repurchased. To estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider the following factors: (i) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio
(both actual and estimated future defaults); (ii) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims; (iii) estimated probable future repurchase claims, considering information about expected investor behaviors, delinquent and liquidated
loans, resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions; (iv) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims (“rescission rate”); (v) the
availability of legal defenses; and (vi) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral, make-whole settlement or indemnification.

Our repurchase obligations involve Agency securitizations and other loan sales with FNMA and FHLMC subsequent to 2008, as well as Agency securitizations with GNMA and

Non-Agency

securitizations and other loan sales with private investors. The unpaid principal balance of loans associated with our exposure to repurchase obligations totaled $60.5 billion at
December 31, 2016, of which $.9 billion was 90 days or more delinquent. The comparative amounts were $65.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the residential mortgage indemnification and repurchase liability for estimated losses on indemnification and repurchase claims totaled $66 million and $94 million, respectively, and was included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

Liquidity and Capital Management

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is potential loss
assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available. We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated
company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances, and
to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.

Management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning
indicators that may indicate a potential market, or

PNC-specific,

liquidity stress event. In addition, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of
severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential stress event. In the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that our liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure.
The simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated

run-off

of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets
and heavy demand to fund committed obligations. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding

24-month

period. Liquidity-related risk limits are established within our Enterprise Liquidity Management Policy and supporting policies. Management committees, including the Asset and Liability Committee, and
the Board of Directors and its Risk Committee regularly review compliance with key established limits.

In addition to these liquidity
monitoring measures and tools described above, we also monitor our liquidity by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet
net liquidity needs over the course of a

30-day

stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as defined and calculated
in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC
Bank were required to maintain was 90% in 2016 and the minimum increased to 100% in 2017. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR on a daily basis and as of December 31, 2016, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the 2017 fully

phased-in

requirement of 100%.

Form 10-K



We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on
us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.

Sources of Funding

Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our retail and commercial banking
businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and

low-cost

funding. Total deposits increased to $257.2 billion at December 31, 2016 from $249.0 billion at December 31, 2015, driven
by growth in demand and savings deposits, which reflected in part a shift from money market deposits, partially offset by a decline in time deposits. Certain assets determined by us to be liquid and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources
are also available to maintain our liquidity position.

At December 31, 2016, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold,
resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $29.6 billion and securities available for sale totaling $60.1 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors,
including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Of our total liquid assets of $89.7 billion, we had $4.5 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to
secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $5.0 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.

We also obtain liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB
advances) and short-term borrowings (Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings).

Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note
program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior
notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At December 31, 2016, PNC Bank had $24.8 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $19.1 billion were senior bank notes and
$5.7 billion were subordinated bank notes. The following table details issuances for the three months ended December 31, 2016:

PNC Bank is a member of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh
secured generally by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2016, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $27.5 billion with the FHLB-Pittsburgh. Total FHLB
borrowings decreased to $17.5 billion at December 31, 2016 compared with $20.1 billion at December 31, 2015 as maturities outpaced draws.

The FHLB-Pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of PNC Bank to secure certain public deposits. If the FHLB-Pittsburgh is required to make payment for a
beneficiary’s draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized advance to PNC Bank. At December 31, 2016, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the FHLB-Pittsburgh totaled $4.4 billion.

PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2016, there
were no issuances outstanding under this program.

PNC Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window to meet short-term
liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. These
potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. At December 31, 2016, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $17.5 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank.

Borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short-term and long-term funding sources. See Note 10 Borrowed Funds and the Funding sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review for additional
information related to our Borrowings.

In addition to managing liquidity risk at the consolidated company level, we monitor the parent
company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding

affiliates. Additionally, the parent
company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2016, available parent company liquidity totaled $4.5 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which provide
for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.

The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank,
which may be impacted by the following:

•

Bank-level capital needs,

•

Laws and regulations,

•

Corporate policies,

•

Contractual restrictions, and

•

Other factors.

There are
statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its

non-bank

subsidiaries. The amount
available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Report for a further discussion of these limitations. We provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions in Note 15 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments
from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s

non-bank

subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and
equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of
December 31, 2016, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding. The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments.

See Note 23 Subsequent Events for information on the February 7, 2017 issuance of $575 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due August 7,
2018 off of the shelf registration statement.

Total parent company borrowings outstanding totaled $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016
compared with $7.5 billion at December 31, 2015. The decline was primarily attributable to maturities of $1.2 billion during the year. As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately $601 million of parent company
borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year.

Commitments

The following tables set forth contractual obligations and various other commitments as of December 31, 2016 representing required and potential cash outflows.

Table 25:

Contractual Obligations

(a)

Includes basis adjustment relating to accounting hedges.

(b)

Includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by noncancellable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees.

At December 31, 2016, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $22 million, which represents a reserve for tax positions that we have taken in our
tax returns which ultimately may not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimate has been excluded from the
contractual obligations table. See Note 17 Income Taxes in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Our contractual obligations totaled $79.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the comparison is primarily attributable to declines in borrowed funds and time deposits. See Funding
Sources in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our funding sources.

Table 26:

Other Commitments (a)

(a)

Other commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. Loan commitments are
reported net of syndications, assignments and participations.

(b)

Commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions.

(c)

Includes $3.9 billion of standby letters of credit that support remarketing programs for customers’ variable rate demand notes.

(d)

Reinsurance agreements are with third-party insurers related to insurance sold to or placed on behalf of our customers. Balances represent estimates based on
availability of financial information.

(e)

Includes other commitments of $215 million that were not on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $752 million of other commitments were included in
Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


Our total commitments were $155.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in the comparison is
primarily attributable to an increase in commitments to extend credit, partially offset by declines in net outstanding standby letters of credit.

Credit Ratings

PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short- and
long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, and the ability to offer certain products.

In general, rating
agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. In addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to scrutiny arising from the most recent financial crisis and could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, particularly
in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could impact our liquidity and financial condition. A
decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

Table 27:

Credit Ratings as of December 31, 2016 for PNC and PNC Bank

Capital Management

We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury
stock transactions and capital redemptions, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.

For the full year 2016, we returned
$3.1 billion of capital to shareholders. Repurchases totaled 22.8 million common shares for $2.0 billion and dividends on common shares were $1.1 billion.

We repurchase shares of PNC common stock under share repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors

in the amount of up to 100 million shares and consistent with capital plans submitted to, and accepted by, the Federal Reserve. Repurchases are made on the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions and the extent and timing of share repurchases under authorizations depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative
uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR
and DFAST processes.

For the five quarter period ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased 29.9 million shares of PNC common stock for
$2.7 billion, which was consistent with the 2015 capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve as part of our 2015 CCAR submission. Of the total repurchased, 12.0 million shares for $1.0 billion occurred in the first two quarters of
2016.

In connection with the 2016 CCAR process, the Federal Reserve accepted our capital plan, as approved by our Board of Directors, and did
not object to our proposed capital actions in April 2016. As provided for in the 2016 capital plan, we announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2016, including
repurchases of up to $200 million related to employee benefit plans. We repurchased 10.8 million common shares for $1.0 billion during the third and fourth quarters of 2016 under these share repurchase programs.

In January 2017, we announced a $300 million increase in our share repurchase programs for the four quarter period ended June 30, 2017.

The quarterly cash dividend on common stock was increased to 55 cents from 51 cents effective with the August 5, 2016 dividend payment
date.

On November 1, 2016 we issued 525,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100

th

interest in a share of our

Fixed-to-Floating

Rate

Non-Cumulative

Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series S, in an underwritten public offering resulting in gross proceeds of $525 million to us
before commissions and expenses. We issued 5,250 shares of Series S Preferred Stock to the depositary in this transaction. See Note 15 Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information on the
terms of the securities.

See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business in this Report for further information concerning the
CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans.

As a result of the phase-in periods included in the final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules (Basel
III rules), as well as the fact that we remain in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2016 were based on the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the
Basel III rules (as such definitions and deductions were phased-in for 2016) and the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Until we have exited parallel run, our regulatory risk-based Basel III ratios will be calculated using
the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in through 2019). Once we exit parallel run, our regulatory
risk-based capital ratios will be the lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the

phased-in

Basel III
provisions in effect for 2016 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2016 Transitional Basel III ratios. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally
assigned a

pre-defined

risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures, equity exposures and securitization exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than
other types of exposures.

Under the Basel III rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, significant common stock investments in
unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a

phase-in

schedule and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the
extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution’s adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes (subject to a

phase-in

schedule) accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.

Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have
required the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital
consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our December 31, 2016 capital levels were aligned with them.

At
December 31, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have
Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank

must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage
ratio of at least 5%.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us
in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of
this Report for details on our December 31, 2015 Transitional Basel III and Pro forma fully

phased-in

Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratios.

Market Risk Management

Market
risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our
involvement in the following activities, among others:

•

Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,

•

Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and

•

Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.

We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market
Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest
rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded
options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.

Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015 follow:

Table 29:

Interest Sensitivity Analysis

(a)

Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely
simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 30 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two

12-month

periods assuming (i) the PNC
Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between

and

rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates
are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and
the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing

on-

and

off-balance

sheet positions. These assumptions
determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other

interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 29 and 30 above. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.

The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.

Table 31:

Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward

The fourth quarter 2016 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to
benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and
market conditions.

Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk

We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These
transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) related to our customer derivatives portfolio are

marked-to-market

daily and reported as
customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.

We use

value-at-risk

(VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical
analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2016 and 2015 were within our acceptable
limits.

To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as
backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. Our VaR measure assumes that exposures remain constant and that recent
market variability is a good predictor of future variability. Actual observations include customer related revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce losses and can reduce the number of instances actual losses


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


exceed the prior day VaR measure. There were two and seven instances during 2016 and 2015, respectively under our diversified VaR measure where actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR
measure and those losses were insignificant. Our portfolio and enterprise-wide VaR models utilize a historical approach with a 500 day look back period.

Customer-related trading revenue was $203 million for full year 2016 compared with $210 million for full year 2015 and is recorded in Other noninterest income and Other interest income on our
Consolidated Income Statement. The decrease was mainly due to market interest rate changes impacting valuations for customer-related derivatives, partially offset by higher derivative and fixed income client sales.

Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk

Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, securities underwriting and
trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and

non-affiliated

funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity-oriented hedge funds. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights
are directly affected by changes in market factors.

Various of our business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our
businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

Tax Credit Investments

Included in our
equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated

entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $.7 billion at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These unfunded commitments are
included in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report has further information on Tax Credit Investments.

Private Equity
and Other

The majority of our other equity investments consists of our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an
illiquid portfolio consisted of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.3 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. See Item 1
Business – Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report for discussion of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in and of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule.

Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. At December 31, 2016, the fair
value of our investment in Visa Class B common shares was approximately $452 million and our cost basis was not significant. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be
converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of the pending interchange litigation. Please see Note 6 Fair Value and Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our Visa agreements.

We also have certain other equity investments, the
majority of which represent investments in affiliated and

non-affiliated

funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not significant during
2016 and 2015.

Impact of Inflation

Our assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and
determinable amounts of money. However, during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the need or demand for our
products and services. Should significant levels of inflation occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from
possible increased default rates.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Financial Derivatives

We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market and credit risk inherent in our business activities.
Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest
rate risk management. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.

Financial derivatives
involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Periodic cash payments are exchanged for interest rate swaps, options and future contracts. Premiums are also exchanged for options contracts. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit
risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.

Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in
Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 6 Fair Value and Note 13 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated here by reference.

Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their
intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or
systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization.

Operational risk
management is embedded in our culture and decision-making processes through a systematic approach whereby operational risks and exposures are: 1) identified and assessed; 2) managed through the design and implementation of controls; 3) measured and
evaluated against our risk tolerance limits; and 4) appropriately reported to management and the Risk Committee. Strong operational risk management and well-informed risk-based decisions benefit us by improving the customer experience, enhancing
compliance, reducing reputational risk, minimizing losses, and establishing an appropriate amount of required operational risk capital held by the bank.

The Operational Risk Management Framework supports our effective and consistent management of operational risk. The primary purpose of the framework is to enable us to understand our operational risks and
manage them to the desired risk profile, in line with our Risk Appetite.

Additionally, the guidance established within the framework enables management to make well-informed risk-based business decisions.

The framework provides a disciplined and structured process for us to manage operational risk across eight operational risk domains. These domains provide a comprehensive view of operational risk and
allow us to discuss operational risk in a standard way, facilitating reporting and ongoing risk mitigation.

The operational risk domains are:

•

Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, misconduct or errors of people or fraud.

•

Compliance: Risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations,
rules, self-regulatory standards, or other regulatory requirements.

•

Data Management: Risk associated with incomplete or inaccurate data.

•

Model: Risk associated with the design, implementation, and ongoing use and management of a model.

•

Technology and Systems: Risk associated with the use, operation, and adoption of technology.

•

Information Security: Risk resulting from the failure to protect information and ensure appropriate access to, and use and handling of information
assets.

•

Business Continuity: Risk of potential disruptive events to business activities.

•

Third Party: Risk arising from failure of third party providers to conduct activity in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with contract
provisions and applicable laws and regulations.

We utilize operational risk management programs within the framework,
including RCSAs, scenario analysis, and internal and external loss event review and analysis, to assess existing risks, determine potential/emerging risks and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. The program tools and methodology enable
our business managers to identify potential risks and control gaps.

Lines of business are responsible for identifying, owning, managing, and
monitoring the operational risks and controls associated with its business activities and product or service offerings to within acceptable levels. Centralized functions, such as Business Continuity, Enterprise Third Party Management, and
Information Security, are responsible for the development, implementation and management of their individual programs and for the development and maintenance of the policies, procedures, methodologies, tools, and technology utilized across the
enterprise to identify, assess, monitor, and report program risks. Additionally, independent risk management reviews and challenges line of business adherence to the framework to ensure proper controls are in place and appropriate risk mitigation
plans are established as necessary.

Compliance Risk

Enterprise Compliance is responsible for coordinating the compliance risk component of our Operational Risk Management Framework. Compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide
monitoring and tracking programs. Key compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of our
operational risk profile. A risk committee, chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for oversight of compliance and fiduciary risk management programs across PNC. In order to help understand and proactively address emerging
regulatory issues where appropriate, Enterprise Compliance communicates regularly with various regulators with supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to us, our subsidiaries, or businesses and participates in forums focused on
regulatory and compliance matters in the financial services industry.

UDGMENTS

Our consolidated financial statements are
prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies
require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.

Fair Value Measurements

We must
use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement
volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation
specialists, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these
areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.

We apply ASC 820 – Fair Value
Measurements. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance
requires a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement
are observable or unobservable.

The following table summarizes the
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit

We maintain the ALLL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate
to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and on these unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. Our determination of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease
portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other relevant factors. These critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. We have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality,
quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. These evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include,
among others:

•

Probability of default (PD),

•

Loss given default (LGD),

•

Outstanding balance of the loan,

•

Movement through delinquency stages,

•

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,

•

Value of collateral, which may be obtained from third parties, and

•

Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results.

For all loans, the ALLL is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific/individual impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative (formulaic or
pooled) reserves and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed
changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. For unfunded commitments, the reserve estimate also includes estimation of the probability of funding. Key reserve assumptions are
periodically updated.

To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that
would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information:

•

Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7, and

•

Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements and Allocation of
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report.

Goodwill

Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the Retail
Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking businesses.

The value of goodwill is supported by earnings, which is driven by our
invested assets and transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings and realized profitability resulting from a lack of growth or our
inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or
circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an
effect on the unit. For this review, inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount (“Step 1” of the goodwill impairment test) as further discussed below. The
fair values of our reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions based upon market comparables. Additionally, we may also evaluate certain financial metrics that are indicative of fair value, including
market quotes, price to earnings ratios and recent acquisitions involving other financial institutions. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount, the reporting unit’s goodwill would be evaluated for impairment. In this circumstance, the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, which is determined as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination, would be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill (“Step 2” of the goodwill impairment test). If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment
loss.

The results of our annual 2016 impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded
their carrying values by at least 10% and are not considered to be at risk of not passing Step 1. By definition, assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain, but absent a significant
change in economic conditions of a reporting unit, we would not expect the fair values of these reporting units to decrease below their respective carrying values. Similarly, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2015 or 2014.

See Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional
information.

Form 10-K


Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights

We elect to measure our residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value. This election was made to be consistent with our risk
management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. The fair value of residential and commercial MSRs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash
flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions.

We employ risk management strategies designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. The values of the
residential and commercial MSRs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to
have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate
financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial MSRs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be less
predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the MSRs.

The following sections
of this Report provide further information on residential and commercial MSRs:

Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Income Taxes

In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of
filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations.

We evaluate
and assess the relative risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax
accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and

assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different
than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
This ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP with one accounting model. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict
the satisfaction of a performance obligation by transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the mandatory effective date of ASU

2014-09

for one year, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. During 2016, the FASB also issued four separate ASUs which amend the original standard to clarify guidance regarding
principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations and licensing, certain narrow-scope amendments which address the presentation of sales tax, noncash consideration, contract modifications at transition and assessing
collectability and other minor technical corrections and improvements.

The requirements within ASU

2014-09

and its subsequent amendments should be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (with several practical expedients for certain completed contracts) or retrospectively with the cumulative
effect of initially applying ASU

2014-09

recognized at the date of initial application (i.e., modified retrospective application). We plan to adopt the ASU consistent with the deferred mandatory effective date
using the modified retrospective approach. Based on our evaluation to date, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position. We expect that
the most significant impact related to the standard’s expanded disclosure requirements will be the disaggregation of revenue.

Financial Instruments

In January 2016,
the FASB issued ASU

2016-01,

Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic

825-10):

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities.

This ASU changes the accounting for certain equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



instruments. Equity investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also
simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments for which fair value is not readily determinable. Additionally, the ASU changes the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value, and amends
certain disclosure requirements relating to the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied using a
modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet, except for the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively. We plan to adopt all
provisions consistent with the effective date and are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our results of operations and financial position. However, we expect the standard will most significantly impact equity investments that are
currently accounted for under the cost method which will likely have a positive impact on income when transitioned to fair value measurement.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU

2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842

)

. The primary change in the new guidance is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for operating leases. The ASU requires lessees to
recognize a

right-of-use

asset and related lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of
expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15,
2018 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-13,

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

. The ASU requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology;
specifically, expected credit losses for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or acquisition. The expected credit loss methodology will apply to loans, debt securities, and other financial assets and net
investment in leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It will also apply to

off-balance

sheet credit exposures except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. Assets in the scope of the
ASU, except for purchased credit deteriorated assets, will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets.

Enhanced credit quality disclosures will be required including disaggregation of credit quality indicators
by vintage. The development of an expected credit loss methodology and new disclosures will require significant data collection, building or enhancing loss models, and process

re-development

prior to adoption.
The ASU is effective for us for the first quarter of 2020 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We have established a company-wide,
cross-functional governance structure. We have also begun assessing the required changes to our credit loss estimation methodologies and systems, as well as additional data and resource requirements to be able to comply with the standard. We
continue to assess the impact of the standard; however, we expect the guidance will result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to cover credit losses over the estimated life of the financial assets. The magnitude of the increase in our
allowance for loan losses at the adoption date will be dependent upon the nature of the characteristics of the portfolio at the adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date.

Statement of Cash Flows

In August 2016,
the FASB issued ASU

2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.

The ASU provides guidance on eight specific issues related to classification
within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. The specific issues cover cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; cash outflows for settlement of

zero-coupon

debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant; contingent consideration payments that are not made soon after a business combination; proceeds from the
settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests received in
securitization transactions; and clarifies that when no specific GAAP guidance exists and the source of the cash flows are not separately identifiable, then the predominant source of cash flows should be used to determine the classification for the
item. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance
requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

Duration of equity

– An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of
equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (

i.e.

, positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (

i.e.

, positioned for declining interest rates). For example,
if the duration of equity is

-1.5

years, the economic value of equity increases by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.

Earning assets

– Assets that generate income, which include: interest-earning deposits with banks; loans held for sale; loans; investment securities; and certain other assets.

Effective duration

– A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would
approximate the percentage change in value of

on-

and

off-

balance sheet positions.

Efficiency

– Noninterest expense divided by total revenue.

Fair
value

– The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Fee income

– When referring to the components of Noninterest income, we use the term fee income to refer to the following categories within Noninterest income: Asset management;
Consumer services; Corporate services; Residential mortgage; and Service charges on deposits.

FICO score

– A credit
bureau-based industry standard score created by Fair Isaac Co. which predicts the likelihood of borrower default. We use FICO scores both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our consumer lending portfolio. Lower FICO scores indicate likely
higher risk of default, while higher FICO scores indicate likely lower risk of default. FICO scores are updated on a periodic basis.

Foreign exchange contracts

– Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously
agreed-upon terms.

Futures and forward contracts

– Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller
agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.

GAAP

– Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Home price index (HPI)

– A broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices in the U.S.

Impaired loans

– Loans are determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected.

Impaired loans include commercial nonperforming loans and consumer and commercial TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans held for
sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogenous type loans and purchased impaired loans.

Interest rate
swap contracts

– Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments
for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.

Intrinsic value

– The difference between the price, if
any, required to be paid for stock issued pursuant to an equity compensation arrangement and the fair market value of the underlying stock.

Leverage ratio

– Tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly adjusted total assets.

LIBOR

– Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale
money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis. Our product set includes loans priced using LIBOR as a benchmark.

Loan-to-value

ratio (LTV)

– A calculation of a
loan’s collateral coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is the sum total of loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the market value of that same collateral. Market values
of the collateral are based on an independent valuation of the collateral. For example, a LTV of less than 90% is better secured and has less credit risk than a LTV of greater than or equal to 90%.

Loss given default (LGD)

–

An estimate of loss, net of recovery based on collateral type, collateral
value, loan exposure, and other factors. Each loan has its own LGD. The LGD risk rating measures the percentage of exposure of a specific credit obligation that we expect to lose if default occurs. LGD is net of recovery, through any means,
including but not limited to the liquidation of collateral or deficiency judgments rendered from foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings.

Nonaccrual loans

– Loans for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonaccrual loans include nonperforming loans, in addition to
loans accounted for under fair value option and loans accounted for as held for sale for which full collection of contractual principal and/or interest is not probable.

Nondiscretionary client assets under administration

– Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a nondiscretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


Nonperforming assets

– Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and OREO,
foreclosed and other assets, but exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased
impaired loans. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.

Nonperforming loans

– Loans
accounted for at amortized cost for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other consumer
customers as well as TDRs which have not returned to performing status. Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest, loans held for sale, loans
accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans. Nonperforming loans exclude purchased impaired loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.

Notional amount

– A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivative contract.

Operating leverage

– The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage
change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (

i.e.

, positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (

i.e.

, negative
operating leverage).

Options

– Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the
obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future.

Other real estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets

–Assets taken in settlement of troubled loans primarily through

deed-in-lieu

of foreclosure or foreclosure. Foreclosed and other assets include real and personal property, equity interests in corporations, partnerships, and limited
liability companies. Excludes certain assets that have a government guarantee which are classified as other receivables.

Probability of
default (PD)

– An internal risk rating that indicates the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status.

Recovery

– Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for
loan and lease losses.

Risk

– The potential that an event or series of events could occur that would threaten our
ability to achieve our strategic objectives, thereby negatively affecting shareholder value or reputation.

Risk appetite

– A dynamic, forward-looking view on the aggregate amount of risk we
are willing and able to take in executing business strategy in light of the current business environment.

Risk
limits

– Quantitative measures based on forward looking assumptions that allocate the firm’s aggregate risk appetite (

e.g.

measure of loss or negative events) to business lines, legal entities, specific risk
categories, concentrations and as appropriate, other levels.

Risk profile

– The risk profile is a

point-in-time

assessment of risk. The profile represents overall risk position in relation to the desired risk appetite. The determination of the risk profile’s position
is based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of reported risk limits, metrics, operating guidelines and qualitative assessments.

Risk-weighted assets

– Computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System) to assets and

off-balance

sheet instruments.

Servicing
rights

– An intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and
insurance premiums held in escrow.

Taxable-equivalent interest income

– The interest income earned on certain assets is
completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these

tax-exempt

instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and
margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on

tax-exempt

assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.

Transitional Basel III common equity

–

Common equity calculated under Basel III using

phased-in

definitions and deductions applicable
to us during the related presentation period.

Troubled debt restructuring (TDR)

– A loan whose terms have been
restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

Value-at-risk

(VaR)

– A statistically-based measure of risk that describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum
loss which should not be exceeded on 95 out of 100 days for a 95% VaR.

Yield curve

– A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial
instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a “normal” or “positive” yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A “flat” yield
curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A “steep” yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An “inverted” or “negative” yield
curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.

NFORMATION

We make
statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters
regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as
“believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,”
“will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.

Our forward-looking statements are
subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.

•

Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:

–

Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.

–

Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.

–

Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.

–

Changes in law and policy accompanying the new presidential administration and uncertainty or speculation pending the enactment of such changes.

–

Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.

–

Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.

–

Continued residual effects of recessionary conditions and uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties,
including adverse impacts on levels of unemployment, loan utilization rates, delinquencies, defaults and counterparty ability to meet credit and other obligations.

–

Commodity price volatility.

–

Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether due to changing business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or
other factors.

•

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than
those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current view that the U.S. economy and the labor market will grow moderately in 2017, boosted by stable oil/energy prices, improving consumer spending and housing activity, and
expanded federal fiscal policy stimulus as a result of the 2016 elections. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to continue rising in 2017, along with inflation. These forward-looking statements also do not, unless otherwise
indicated, take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.

•

Our ability to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under
current or future programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, is subject to the review of such proposed actions by the Federal Reserve Board as part of our comprehensive capital plan for the applicable
period in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and

non-objection

to such capital actions by the
Federal Reserve Board.

•

Our regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final
capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the international body responsible for developing global
regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions), and management actions affecting the composition of our balance sheet. In addition, our ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory
capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.

•

Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations,
competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could
include:

–

Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer
protection, tax, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.

–

Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the Dodd-Frank Act and initiatives of the Basel Committee.

–

Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may
result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to us.

–

Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.

–

Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of
our intellectual property protection in general.

•

Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where
appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.

•

Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information
provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.

•

We grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and
other liabilities. Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting
from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.

•

Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share,
deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.

•

Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system
failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in this Report, and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk
Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed
elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of
comprehensive income, of changes in equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control

–

Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial

statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests, and variable interest entities.

We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAP). We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the 2016 presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

We prepared
these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value
measurements and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.

Investment in BlackRock, Inc.

We
account for our investment in the common stock and Series B Preferred Stock of BlackRock (deemed to be

in-substance

common stock) under the equity method of

accounting. The investment in BlackRock is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Equity investments, while our equity in earnings of BlackRock is reported on our Consolidated Income
Statement in Asset management revenue.

We also hold shares of Series C Preferred Stock of BlackRock pursuant to our obligation to partially
fund a portion of certain BlackRock long-term incentive plan (LTIP) programs. Since these preferred shares are not deemed to be

in-substance

common stock, we have elected to account for these preferred shares
at fair value and the changes in fair value will offset the impact of

marking-to-market

the obligation to deliver these shares to BlackRock. Our investment in the
BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other assets. Our obligation to transfer these shares to BlackRock is classified as a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument under GAAP as disclosed in
Note 13 Financial Derivatives.

Special Purpose Entities

Special purpose entities (SPEs) are defined as legal entities structured for a particular purpose. We use special purpose entities in various legal forms to conduct normal business activities. We review
the structure and activities of special purpose entities for possible consolidation under the applicable GAAP guidance.

A variable interest
entity (VIE) is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets generally that either:

•

Does not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity’s activities through those
voting rights or similar rights, or

•

Has equity investors that do not provide sufficient equity for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.

A VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property.

VIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC 810 –Consolidation when we hold a variable interest in these entities. We consolidate a VIE if we
are its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and
(ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Upon consolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of the VIE’s assets,

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



liabilities and noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we determine whether any changes occurred requiring a reassessment of whether we are the primary
beneficiary of an entity.

See Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities for information about VIEs that we
consolidate as well as those that we do not consolidate but in which we hold a significant variable interest.

Revenue Recognition

We earn interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:

•

Lending,

•

Securities portfolio,

•

Asset management,

•

Customer deposits,

•

Loan sales and servicing,

•

Brokerage services,

•

Sale of loans and securities,

•

Certain private equity activities, and

•

Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities.

We earn fees and commissions from:

•

Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees,

•

Selling various insurance products,

•

Providing treasury management services,

•

Providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services, and

•

Participating in certain capital markets transactions.

Revenue earned on interest-earning assets, including unearned income and the amortization/accretion of premiums or discounts recognized on acquired loans and debt securities, is recognized based on the
constant effective yield of the financial instrument or based on other applicable accounting guidance.

Our Asset management noninterest
income includes asset management fees, which are generally based on a percentage of the fair value of the assets under management. Additionally, it includes our share of the earnings of BlackRock recognized under the equity method of accounting.

Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized when earned. Brokerage fees and gains and losses on the sale of securities and certain
derivatives are recognized on a trade-date basis.

We record private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying
investments or when we dispose of our interest.

We recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments where we have
elected the fair value option. These financial instruments include certain commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale, certain residential mortgage portfolio loans, resale agreements and our investment in BlackRock Series C
preferred stock. We also recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSRs).

We recognize revenue from servicing residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans as earned based on the specific contractual
terms. These revenues are reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Consumer services. We recognize revenue from securities, derivatives and foreign exchange customer-related
trading, as well as securities underwriting activities, as these transactions occur or as services are provided. We generally recognize gains from the sale of loans upon receipt of cash. Mortgage revenue recognized is reported net of mortgage
repurchase reserves.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and due from banks are considered “cash and cash equivalents” for financial reporting purposes.

Investments

We hold interests in various types of investments. The accounting for
these investments is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, items such as:

•

Ownership interest,

•

Our plans for the investment, and

•

The nature of the investment.

Debt Securities

Debt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. We classify
debt securities as held to maturity and carry them at amortized cost if we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities that we purchase for certain risk management activities or customer-related trading
activities are carried at fair value and classified as trading securities and are reported in the Other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other
noninterest income.

Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are designated as securities available for sale and carried
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


On at least a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position for
other than temporary impairment (OTTI). An investment security is deemed impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. Amortized cost includes adjustments (if any) made to the cost basis of an investment for
accretion, amortization, previous other-than-temporary impairments and hedging gains and losses. After an investment security is determined to be impaired, we evaluate whether the decline in value is other-than-temporary. Declines in the fair value
of available for sale and held to maturity debt securities that are deemed other-than-temporary and are attributable to credit deterioration are recognized in Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the
determination is made. Declines in fair value which are deemed other-than-temporary and attributable to factors other than credit deterioration are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We include all interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities, in net
interest income using the constant effective yield method calculated over the estimated lives of the securities taking into account anticipated prepayments. Effective yields reflect either the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the
date of acquisition or the effective interest rate determined based on improved cash flows subsequent to impairment. We compute gains and losses realized on the sale of available for sale debt securities on a specific security basis. These
securities gains/(losses) are included in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.

In certain situations, management
may elect to transfer certain debt securities from the securities available for sale to the held to maturity classification. In such cases, the securities are reclassified at fair value at the time of transfer. Any unrealized gain or loss included
in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the time of transfer is retained therein and amortized over the remaining life of the security as a yield adjustment, such that only the remaining initial discount/premium from the purchase date is
recognized in income.

Equity Securities and Partnership Interests

We account for equity securities and equity investments other than BlackRock and private equity investments under one of the following methods:

•

Marketable equity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis and are accounted for based on the securities’ quoted market prices from a
national securities exchange. Those purchased with the intention of selling in the near term are classified as trading and included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading
securities are included in Noninterest income. Marketable equity

securities not classified as trading are designated as securities available for sale with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). Any unrealized losses that we have determined to be other-than-temporary on securities classified as available for sale are recognized in current period earnings.

•

For investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other investments that are not required to be consolidated, we use either the
equity method or the cost method of accounting. We use the equity method for general and limited partner ownership interests and limited liability companies in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the
investee. Under the equity method, we record our equity ownership share of net income or loss of the investee in Noninterest income and any dividends received on equity method investments are recorded as a reduction to the investment balance. We use
the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method, there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends received are considered a return on investment. If the decline is determined
to be other-than-temporary, we write down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in Noninterest income. Distributions received from the
income of an investee on cost method investments are included in Noninterest income. Investments described above are included in Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Private Equity Investments

We
report private equity investments, which include direct investments in companies, affiliated partnership interests and indirect investments in private equity funds, at estimated fair value. These estimates are based on available information and may
not necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the investments. Fair values of publicly traded direct investments are determined using quoted market prices and are subject to various
discount factors for lack of marketability, when appropriate. The valuation procedures applied to direct investments and indirect investments are detailed in Note 6 Fair Value. We include all private equity investments within Equity investments on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of private equity investments are recognized in Noninterest income.

We consolidate
affiliated partnerships when we are the general partner and have determined that we have control of the partnership or are the primary beneficiary if the entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own is reflected in Noncontrolling interests on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Loans

Loans are classified as held for investment when management has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. Management’s intent and view of
the foreseeable future may change based on changes in business strategies, the economic environment, market conditions and the availability of government programs.

Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent.

Except as described below, loans held for investment are stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees
and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest on performing loans (excluding interest on purchased impaired loans, which is further discussed below) is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and
recorded in Interest income as earned using the constant effective yield method. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and loan premiums and discounts are deferred and accreted or amortized into Net interest income using the constant
effective yield method, over the contractual life of the loan.

In addition to originating loans, we also acquire loans through portfolio
purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies. For certain acquired loans that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality, we follow the guidance contained in ASC

310-30 – Loans

and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Under this guidance, acquired purchased impaired loans are to be recorded at fair value without the carryover of any
existing valuation allowances. When evidence of credit quality deterioration and evidence that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractual amounts due exist, we consider the loans to be purchased credit impaired and we estimate
the amount and timing of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition for each loan either individually or on a pool basis. The excess of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected on a purchased impaired loan (or pool of loans) over its
carrying value represents the accretable yield which is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan (or pool of loans) using the constant effective yield method. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that are
attributable, at least in part, to credit quality are recognized as impairments through a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows are recognized as a provision
recapture of previously recorded ALLL or prospectively through an adjustment of the loan’s or pool’s yield over its remaining life.

Loans Held for Sale

We designate
loans as held for sale when we have the intent to sell them. We transfer loans to the Loans held for sale

category at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell. At the time of transfer, write-downs on the loans are recorded as charge-offs. We establish a new cost basis upon
transfer. Any subsequent

lower-of-cost-or-market

adjustment is determined on an
individual loan basis and is recognized as a valuation allowance with any charges included in Other noninterest income.

We have elected to
account for certain commercial and residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The changes in the fair value of the commercial mortgage loans are measured and recorded in Other noninterest income while the residential mortgage loans are
measured and recorded in Residential mortgage noninterest income each period. See Note 6 Fair Value for additional information.

Interest
income with respect to loans held for sale is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and the loan’s contractual interest rate.

In certain circumstances, loans designated as held for sale may be transferred to held for investment based on a change in strategy. We transfer these
loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value; however, any loans originated or purchased for held for sale and designated at fair value remain at fair value for the life of the loan.

Leases

We provide financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft,
energy and power systems, and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased equipment, less unearned income. Leveraged leases, a
form of financing lease, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize income over the term of the lease using the constant effective yield method. Lease residual values are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Gains or losses on the sale
of leased assets are included in Other noninterest income while valuation adjustments on lease residuals are included in Other noninterest expense.

Loan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained Interests

We recognize the sale of
loans or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We have sold mortgage, credit card and other loans through securitization transactions. In a
securitization, financial assets are transferred into trusts or to SPEs in transactions to effectively legally isolate the assets from us.

ASC 860 – Transfers and Servicing requires a true sale legal analysis to address several relevant factors, such as the nature and level of
recourse to the transferor, and the amount and nature of retained interests in the loans sold to support whether the transferred loans would be legally isolated from


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


the transferor’s assets in the case of bankruptcy. Once the legal isolation test has been met, other factors concerning the nature and extent of the transferor’s control and the rights
of the transferee over the transferred assets are taken into account in order to determine whether derecognition of assets is warranted.

In a
securitization, the trust or SPE issues beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the trust. The senior classes of the asset-backed securities typically receive investment
grade credit ratings at the time of issuance. These ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lower-rated subordinated classes of asset-backed securities, as well as subordinated or residual interests. In certain cases, we may retain a
portion or all of the securities issued, interest-only strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, in some cases, cash reserve accounts. Securitized loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized
in Noninterest income at the time of initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on

the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale. We generally estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future expected cash
flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if applicable.

With the
exception of loan sales to certain U.S. government-chartered entities, our loan sales and securitizations are generally structured without recourse to us except for representations and warranties and with no restrictions on the retained interests.
We originate, sell and service commercial mortgage loans under the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program. Under the provisions of the DUS program, we participate in a loss-sharing arrangement
with FNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing or recourse, our policy is to record such liabilities initially at fair value and subsequently reserve for estimated losses in accordance with guidance contained in applicable GAAP.

Nonperforming Loans and Leases

The matrix below summarizes our policies for classifying certain loans as nonperforming loans and/or discontinuing the accrual of loan
interest income.

Commercial loans

Loans Classified as Nonperforming and Accounted for as Nonaccrual

•     Loans accounted for at amortized cost where:

–      The loan is 90 days or more past due.

–      The loan is rated substandard or worse due to the determination that
full collection of principal and interest is not probable as demonstrated by the following conditions:

•     The collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past
due;

•     Reasonable doubt exists as to the certainty of the
borrower’s future debt service ability, according to the terms of the credit arrangement, regardless of whether 90 days have passed or not;

•     The borrower has filed or will likely file for bankruptcy;

•     The bank advances additional funds to cover principal or interest;

•     We are in the process of liquidating a commercial borrower; or

•     We are pursuing remedies under a guarantee.

Loans Excluded from Nonperforming Classification but Accounted for as Nonaccrual

•       Loans accounted for under the fair value option and full
collection of principal and interest is not probable.

•       Loans accounted for at the lower of cost or market less costs to
sell (held for sale) and full collection of principal and interest is not probable.

Loans Excluded from Nonperforming Classification and Nonaccrual Accounting

•       Purchased impaired loans because interest income is accreted
through the accounting model.

•       Loans that are well
secured and in the process of collection.

(continued from previous page)

Consumer loans

Loans Classified as Nonperforming and Accounted for as Nonaccrual

•       Loans accounted for at amortized cost where full collection of
contractual principal and interest is not deemed probable as demonstrated in the policies below:

–      The loan is 90 days past due for home equity and installment loans, and
180 days past due for well secured residential real estate loans;

–      The loan has been modified and classified as a troubled debt
restructuring (TDR);

–      Notification of bankruptcy has been
received within the last 60 days;

–      The bank holds a
subordinate lien position in the loan and the first lien mortgage loan is seriously stressed (i.e., 90 days or more past due);

–      Other loans within the same borrower relationship have been placed on nonaccrual or charge-offs have been taken on them;

–      The bank has repossessed

non-real

estate collateral securing the loan; or

–      The bank has

charged-off

the
loan to the value of the collateral.

Loans Excluded from Nonperforming Classification but Accounted for as Nonaccrual

•       Loans accounted for under the fair value option and full
collection of principal and interest is not probable.

•       Loans accounted for at the lower of cost or market less costs to
sell (held for sale) and full collection of principal and interest is not probable.

Loans Excluded from Nonperforming Classification and Nonaccrual
Accounting

•       Purchased impaired loans because interest income is accreted through the accounting model.

•       Certain government insured loans where substantially all
principal and interest is insured.

•       Residential real
estate loans that are well secured and in the process of collection.

•       Consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential
real estate, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

See Note 3 Asset Quality in this Report for additional detail on nonperforming assets and asset quality
indicators for commercial and consumer loans.

Commercial Loans

We generally charge off Commercial Lending (Commercial, Commercial Real Estate, and Equipment Lease Financing)    nonperforming loans when we determine that a specific loan, or portion
thereof, is uncollectible. This determination is based on the specific facts and circumstances of the individual loans. In making this determination, we consider the viability of the business or project as a going concern, the past due status when
the asset is not well-secured, the expected cash flows to repay the loan, the value of the collateral, and the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform.

Additionally, in general, for smaller commercial loans of $1 million or less, a partial or full

charge-off

occurs at 120 days past due for term loans and 180
days past due for revolvers. Certain small business credit card balances that are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due are

charged-off

at 180 days past due.

Consumer Loans

Home equity installment loans, home equity lines of credit, and residential real estate loans that are not well-secured and in the process of collection are

charged-off

at no later than 180 days past due. At that time, the basis in the loan is reduced to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. In addition to this policy, the bank recognizes a

charge-off

on a secured consumer loan when:

•

The bank holds a subordinate lien position in the loan and a foreclosure notice has been received on the first lien loan;

•

The bank holds a subordinate lien position in the loan which is 30 days or more past due with a combined loan to value ratio of greater than or equal
to 110% and the first lien loan is seriously stressed (

i.e

., 90 days or more past due);

•

The loan is modified or otherwise restructured in a manner that results in the loan becoming collateral dependent;

•

Notification of bankruptcy has been received within the last 60 days;

•

The borrower has been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and has not formally reaffirmed his or her loan obligation to us;
or

•

The collateral securing the loan has been repossessed and the value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment of the loan outstanding.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


For loans that continue to meet any of the above policies, collateral values are updated annually and
subsequent declines in collateral values are

charged-off

resulting in incremental provision for credit loss.

Most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, are charged off after

120-180

days past due.

Accounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases and Other Nonaccrual Loans

For accrual loans, interest income is accrued on a monthly basis and certain fees and costs are deferred upon origination and recognized in income over the term of the loan utilizing an effective yield
method. For nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual and deferred fee/cost recognition is discontinued. Additionally, the current year accrued and uncollected interest is reversed through Net interest income and prior year accrued and uncollected
interest is

charged-off.

Nonaccrual loans may also be

charged-off

to reduce the basis to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell.

If payment is received on a nonaccrual loan, generally the payment is first applied to the recorded investment; payments are then applied to recover any

charged-off

amounts related to the loan. Finally, if both recorded investment and any charge-offs have been recovered, then the payment will be recorded as fee and interest income. For certain consumer loans, the
receipt of interest payments is recognized as interest income on a cash basis. Cash basis income recognition is applied if a loan’s recorded investment is deemed fully collectible and the loan has performed for at least six months.

For TDRs, payments are applied based upon their contractual terms unless the related loan is deemed

non-performing.

TDRs are generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans. However, after a reasonable period of time in which the loan performs under restructured terms and meets other performance
indicators, it is returned to performing/accruing status. This return to performing/accruing status demonstrates that the bank expects to collect all of the loan’s remaining contractual principal and interest. TDRs resulting from 1) borrowers
that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and 2) borrowers that are not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the
restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.

Other nonaccrual loans are generally not returned to accrual status until the borrower
has performed in accordance with the contractual terms and other performance indicators for at least six months, the period of time which was determined to demonstrate the expected collection of the loan’s remaining contractual principal and
interest. When a nonperforming loan is returned to accrual status, it is then considered a performing loan.

See Note 3 Asset Quality and Note 4 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses in this Report for additional TDR
information.

Foreclosed assets consist of any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a

deed-in-lieu

of foreclosure. Other real estate owned comprises principally commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan
obligations. After obtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some jurisdictions the initiation of proceedings under a power of sale in the loan instruments, the property will be sold. When we are awarded title or completion of deed-in-lieu of
foreclosure, we transfer the loan to foreclosed assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is initially recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell. Based upon the estimated
fair value less cost to sell, the recorded investment of the loan is adjusted and, typically, a

charge-off/recovery

is recognized to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL). We estimate fair values
primarily based on appraisals, or sales agreements with third parties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition date or estimated fair value less cost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these
assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in Other noninterest expense.

For certain mortgage loans
that have a government guarantee, we establish a separate other receivable upon foreclosure. The receivable is measured based on the loan balance (inclusive of principal and interest) that is expected to be recovered from the guarantor.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios as of the balance sheet date. Our determination of
the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of these loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. This critical estimate includes significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret this data. These evaluations
are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others:

•

Probability of default (PD),

•

Loss given default (LGD),

•

Outstanding balance of the loan,

•

Movement through delinquency stages,

•

Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,

•

Value of collateral, which may be obtained from third parties, and

•

Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



For all loans, except purchased impaired loans, the ALLL is the sum of three components: (i) asset
specific/individual impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves.

The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to
and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.

See Note 4 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses for additional detail on our ALLL.

Asset Specific/Individual Component

Nonperforming loans that are considered impaired under
ASC 310 – Receivables, which include all commercial and consumer TDRs, are evaluated for a specific reserve. Specific reserve allocations are determined as follows:

•

For commercial nonperforming loans and commercial TDRs greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, specific reserves are based on an analysis
of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows, the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral.

•

For commercial nonperforming loans and commercial TDRs below the defined dollar threshold, the individual loan’s loss given default (LGD)
percentage is multiplied by the loan balance and the results are aggregated for purposes of measuring specific reserve impairment.

•

Consumer nonperforming loans are collectively reserved for unless classified as consumer TDRs. For consumer TDRs, specific reserves are determined
through an analysis of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows, except for those instances where loans have been deemed collateral dependent, including loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability
through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us. Once that determination has been made, those TDRs are charged down to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell at each period end.

Commercial Lending Quantitative Component

The estimates of the quantitative component of ALLL for incurred losses within the commercial lending portfolio segment are determined through statistical loss modeling utilizing PD, LGD and outstanding
balance of the loan. Based upon loan risk ratings, we assign PDs and LGDs. Each of these statistical parameters is determined based on internal historical data and market data. PD is influenced by such factors as liquidity, industry, obligor
financial structure, access to capital and cash flow. LGD is influenced by

collateral type, original and/or updated

loan-to-value

ratio (LTV), facility structure and other factors.

Consumer Lending Quantitative Component

Quantitative estimates within the consumer lending portfolio segment are calculated primarily using a roll-rate model based on statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the
movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately

charge-off

over our loss emergence period.

Qualitative Component

While our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant risk
factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes. We
provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. The ALLL also includes factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of specific or pooled reserves. Such qualitative factors
may include:

•

Industry concentrations and conditions,

•

Recent credit quality trends,

•

Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,

•

Recent macro-economic factors,

•

Model imprecision,

•

Changes in lending policies and procedures,

•

Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and

•

Limitations of available historical data.

Allowance for Purchased

Non-Impaired

Loans

ALLL
for purchased

non-impaired

loans is determined based upon a comparison between the methodologies described above and the remaining acquisition date fair value discount that has yet to be accreted into interest
income. After making the comparison, an ALLL is recorded for the amount greater than the discount, or no ALLL is recorded if the discount is greater.

Allowance for Purchased Impaired Loans

ALLL for purchased impaired loans is determined in
accordance with ASC

310-30

by comparing the net present value of management’s best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan (or pool of loans) to the recorded investment
for a given loan (or pool of loans). In cases where the net present value of expected cash flows is lower than the recorded investment, ALLL is established.

Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit

We maintain the
allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred on these


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. We determine the allowance based on periodic evaluations of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of the probability of
commitment usage, credit risk factors, and, solely for commercial lending, the terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is
estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for funded exposures. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to
the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit are included in the provision for credit losses.

Mortgage Servicing
Rights

We provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential loans. These contracts are either
purchased in the open market or retained as part of a loan securitization or loan sale. All newly acquired or originated servicing rights are initially measured at fair value. Fair value is based on the present value of the expected future net cash
flows, including assumptions as to:

•

Deposit balances and interest rates for escrow and commercial reserve earnings,

•

Discount rates,

•

Estimated prepayment speeds, and

•

Estimated servicing costs.

We measure commercial and residential MSRs at fair value in order to reduce any potential measurement mismatch between our economic hedges and the MSRs.
We manage the risk by hedging the fair value of the MSR with derivatives and securities which are expected to increase in value when the value of the servicing right declines. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recognized as gains/(losses). The
fair value of these servicing rights is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates,
discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions.

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments and the methods and assumptions used in estimating fair value amounts
and financial assets and liabilities for which fair value was elected are detailed in Note 6 Fair Value.

Goodwill

We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be
impaired.

Depreciation and Amortization

For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate premises and equipment, net of salvage value, principally using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.

We use estimated useful lives for furniture and equipment ranging from one to 10 years, and depreciate buildings over an estimated useful life of up to
40 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 years or the respective lease terms, whichever is shorter.

We purchase, as well as internally develop and customize, certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions. Software development costs incurred in the planning and post-development
project stages are charged to Noninterest expense. Costs associated with designing software configuration and interfaces, installation, coding programs and testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over periods
ranging from one to 10 years.

Other Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income, on an

after-tax

basis, primarily consists of unrealized gains or losses, excluding OTTI attributable to credit deterioration, on
investment securities classified as available for sale, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and changes in pension and other postretirement benefit plan liability adjustments. Details of each component are
included in Note 16 Other Comprehensive Income.

Treasury Stock

We record common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the

first-in,

first-out

basis.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process to
help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Interest rate and total return swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps and floors, options, forwards, and futures contracts are the primary instruments
we use for interest rate risk management.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. We manage
these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures.

We recognize all derivative
instruments at fair value as either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Sheet and the related cash flows in the Operating Activities section of the Consolidated Statement Of Cash Flows. Adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the determination of
fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a cash flow or net investment hedging relationship. For all other derivatives, changes in fair
value are recognized in earnings.

We utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet taking into
consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to return, or general rights to reclaim,
cash collateral against the fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized.

For those derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as accounting hedges, we designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.

We formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy, before
undertaking an accounting hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at inception of the hedge relationship. For accounting hedge relationships, we formally assess, both at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective,
hedge accounting is discontinued.

For derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges (

i.e

., hedging the exposure to changes in
the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in LIBOR), changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in earnings the changes in the fair
value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To the extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value of the hedged item, the difference or ineffectiveness is reflected in the Consolidated Income
Statement in the same financial statement category as the hedged item.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (

i.e

., hedging
the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the effective portions of the gain or loss on derivatives are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to income in the same
period or periods during which the hedged transaction

affects earnings. The change in fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in Interest income.

For derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivatives are
reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The change in fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in Noninterest income.

We discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised; or the derivative is

de-designated

as a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the
originally specified time period. If we determine that the derivative no longer qualifies as a fair value or cash flow hedge and hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value
with changes in fair value included in current earnings. For a discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value. For a discontinued cash flow hedge the amount reported in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) up to the date of sale, termination or

de-designation

continues to be reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction affects earnings.

For a cash flow hedge that is discontinued because it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur, the gains and losses in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized immediately into earnings. We did not terminate any cash flow hedges in 2016, 2015 or 2014 due to a determination that a forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring.

We purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At the inception of the transaction, we assess if the
economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, whether the hybrid financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in
earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not meet all of these conditions, the embedded derivative is recorded separately from the host contract
with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, unless we elect to account for the hybrid instrument at fair value.

We have elected, on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, fair value measurement for certain financial instruments with embedded derivatives.

We enter into commitments to originate residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale. We also enter
into commitments to purchase or sell commercial and residential real estate loans. These commitments are accounted for as free-standing derivatives which are recorded at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Any gain or loss from the change in fair value after the inception of the commitment is recognized in Noninterest income.

Income
Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse. The recognition of deferred
tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets. Realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets, assuming that the
underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based
upon all available positive and negative evidence.

We use the deferral method of accounting on investments that generate investment tax
credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the

two-class

method to determine income
attributable to common shareholders. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities under the

two-class

method. Distributed dividends and dividend equivalents related to participating securities and an allocation of undistributed net income to participating securities reduce the amount of income attributable to common shareholders. Income attributable
to common shareholders is then divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period.

Diluted earnings per common share is
calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the

two-class

method. For the diluted calculation, we increase the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the
assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the
issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock method.

These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. See Note 14 Earnings Per Share
for additional information.

This ASU simplifies the accounting for several aspects of share-based payment transactions, including income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The changes which impacted us included a requirement that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies that pertain to share-based
payment arrangements be recognized within income tax expense line instead of Capital surplus – common stock and other. This change also removes the impact of the excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share. We are required to apply these changes on a prospective basis. Additionally, the ASU no longer requires a presentation of excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the vesting and exercise of share-based compensation as
both an operating outflow and financing inflow on the statement of cash flows. This change was applied on a retrospective basis. We elected to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2016. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact
on our results of operations or financial position.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU

2015-02,

Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. All legal entities are subject to evaluation under this ASU, including investment companies and certain other entities measured in a manner consistent with ASC 946 Financial
Services – Investment Companies which were previously excluded. The ASU changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Specifically, the ASU
modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities (VOEs); eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership;
potentially changes the consolidation conclusions of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, in particular those that have fee arrangements and related party arrangements; and provides a scope exception for reporting entities with interests
held in certain money market funds. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2016 under a modified retrospective approach. The impact of adoption resulted in a decrease of $.4 billion in consolidated total assets at January 1, 2016.
In addition the adoption impacted the classification of certain limited partnerships and legal entities as either VIEs or VOEs. See Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities for further disclosure on adoption of the
standard.

Loan Sale and Servicing Activities

We have transferred residential and commercial
mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. These transfers have occurred through Agency securitization,

Non-agency

securitization, and loan sale
transactions. Agency securitizations consist of securitization transactions with Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) (collectively the
Agencies). FNMA and FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market through special purpose entities (SPEs) that they sponsor. We, as an authorized GNMA issuer/servicer, pool
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insured loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market. In

Non-agency

securitizations, we have transferred
loans into securitization SPEs. In other instances, third-party investors have also purchased our loans in loan sale transactions and in certain instances have subsequently sold these loans into securitization SPEs. Securitization SPEs utilized in
the Agency and

Non-agency

securitization transactions are variable interest entities (VIEs).

Our
continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA securitizations,

Non-agency

securitizations, and loan sale transactions generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans under
certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs.

Depending on the transaction, we may act as the master, primary, and/or special servicer to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors. Servicing responsibilities typically consist of collecting and
remitting monthly borrower principal and interest payments, maintaining escrow deposits, performing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, and, in certain instances, funding of servicing advances. Servicing advances, which are reimbursable, are
made for principal and interest and collateral protection and are carried in Other assets at cost.

We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms
of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 6 Fair Value and Note
7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for further discussion of our servicing rights.

Certain loans transferred to the Agencies contain
removal of account provisions (ROAPs). Under these ROAPs, we hold an option to repurchase at par individual delinquent loans that meet certain criteria. In other limited cases, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has granted
us the right to repurchase current loans when we intend to modify the borrower’s interest rate under established guidelines. When we have the unilateral ability to repurchase a loan, effective control over the loan has been regained and we
recognize an asset (in either Loans or Loans held for sale) and a corresponding liability (in Other borrowed funds) on the balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan.

The Agency and

Non-agency

mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs that are purchased and held on our balance sheet are typically purchased in
the secondary market. We do not retain any credit risk on our Agency mortgage-backed security positions as FNMA, FHLMC, and the U.S. Government (for GNMA) guarantee losses of principal and interest.

We also have involvement with certain Agency and

Non-agency

commercial securitization SPEs where we have not
transferred commercial mortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by independent third-parties and the loans held by these entities were purchased exclusively from other third-parties. Generally, our involvement with these SPEs is as servicer with
servicing activities consistent with those described above.

We recognize a liability for our loss exposure associated with contractual
obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to possible breaches of representations and warranties and also for loss sharing arrangements (recourse obligations) with the Agencies. Other than providing temporary liquidity under
servicing advances and our loss exposure associated with our repurchase and recourse obligations, we have not provided nor are we required to provide any type of credit support, guarantees, or commitments to the securitization SPEs or third-party
investors in these transactions.

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

We are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs. We assess VIEs for consolidation
based upon the accounting policies described in Note 1 Accounting Policies. In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU

2015-02

which modified the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal
entities are VIEs or voting interest entities (VOEs). We have not provided additional financial support to these entities which we are not contractually required to provide. As a result of the adoption of ASU

2015-02,

our consolidated VIEs were insignificant at December 31, 2016. Total assets of consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2015 were $1.9 billion which mainly comprised $1.3 billion of loans
and $.4 billion of other assets. At December 31, 2015, total liabilities of consolidated VIEs were $.4 billion.

which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved
in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. We have excluded certain transactions with

non-consolidated

VIEs from the balances presented in Table 36 where we have
determined that our continuing involvement is not significant. In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with

Mortgage-Backed Securitizations

In connection with each Agency and

Non-agency

residential and commercial mortgage-backed securitization discussed above, we evaluate each SPE utilized in these
transactions for consolidation. In performing these assessments, we evaluate our level of continuing involvement in these transactions as the nature of our involvement ultimately determines whether or not we hold a variable interest and/or are the
primary beneficiary of the SPE. Factors we consider in our consolidation assessment include the significance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii) our holdings of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPE, and (iii) the
rights of third-party variable interest holders.

The first step in our assessment is to determine whether we hold a variable interest in the securitization
SPE. We hold variable interests in Agency and

Non-agency

securitization SPEs through our holding of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by the SPEs and/or our recourse obligations.
Each SPE in which we hold a variable interest is evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For Agency securitization transactions, our contractual role as servicer does not give us the power to direct the
activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPEs. Thus, we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities. For

Non-agency

securitization transactions, we would be the primary
beneficiary to the extent our servicing activities give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPE and we hold a more than insignificant variable interest in the entity.

Details about the Agency and

Non-agency

securitization SPEs where we hold a variable interest and are not the
primary beneficiary are included in Table 36. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these SPEs is the carrying value of the mortgage-backed securities, servicing assets, servicing advances, and our liabilities associated
with our recourse obligations. Creditors of the securitization SPEs have no recourse to our assets or general credit.

Tax Credit Investments and Other

For tax credit investments in which we do not have the right to make decisions that will most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, we are not the primary beneficiary and thus do
not consolidate the entity. These investments are disclosed in Table 36. The table also reflects our maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any potential tax credit recapture. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to our legally binding equity
commitments adjusted for recorded impairment, partnership results, or amortization for qualifying low income housing tax credit investments when applicable. For all legally binding unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment
and recognize a liability. As of December 31, 2016, we had a liability for unfunded commitments of $.5 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects which is reflected in Other liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

Table 36 also includes our involvement in lease financing transactions with limited liability companies (LLCs) engaged in
solar power generation that to a large extent provided returns in the form of tax credits. The outstanding financings and operating lease assets are reflected as Loans and Other assets, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas
related liabilities are reported in Deposits and Other liabilities.

We make certain equity investments in various tax credit limited
partnerships or LLCs. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During 2016, we recognized $.2 billion of amortization,
$.2 billion of tax credits, and $.1 billion of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes. The amounts for 2015 were $.2 billion, $.2 billion and
$.1 billion, respectively.

We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in
delinquency rates may be a key indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms
of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale, purchased impaired loans, nonperforming loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option which are on nonaccrual status, but include government insured or
guaranteed loans and accruing loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases,
OREO, foreclosed and other assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is
not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans as these loans are accounted for at fair value. However, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these
loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. Purchased impaired loans are
excluded from nonperforming loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.

See Note 1 Accounting
Policies for additional information on our loan related policies.

Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale. Recorded investment in a loan includes the unpaid principal balance plus accrued
interest and net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.

(b)

Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original
contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate mortgages totaling $.6 billion and Education and other
consumer loans totaling $.4 billion at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

(c)

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual
accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the nonperforming loan population.

In the normal course of business, we originate or purchase loan products with contractual characteristics
that, when concentrated, may increase our exposure as a holder of those loan products. Possible product features that may create a concentration of credit risk would include a high original or updated LTV ratio, terms that may expose the borrower to
future increases in repayments above increases in market interest rates, and interest-only loans, among others.

We originate interest-only
loans to commercial borrowers. Such credit arrangements are usually designed to match borrower cash flow expectations (

e.g.

, working capital lines, revolvers). These products are standard in the financial services industry and product
features are considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk that the interest-only feature may result in borrowers not being able to make interest and principal payments when due. We do not believe that these product
features create a concentration of credit risk.

At December 31, 2016, we pledged $22.0 billion of commercial loans to the Federal
Reserve Bank (FRB) and $60.8 billion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) as collateral for the contingent ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 were
$20.2 billion and $56.4 billion, respectively.

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance

with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the TDR section within this Note.

Total nonperforming loans in Table 38 include TDRs of $1.1 billion at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. TDRs that are
performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015, and are excluded from nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are returned to accrual status
and classified as performing after demonstrating a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not
formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. See the TDRs section of this Note 3 for
more information on TDRs.

Additional Asset Quality Indicators

We have two overall portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in
initial measurement, risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The Commercial Lending segment is composed of the commercial, commercial real estate and equipment lease financing loan classes. The Consumer Lending
segment is composed of the home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other consumer loan classes.

Commercial Lending Asset
Classes

Commercial Loan Class

For commercial loans, we monitor the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we
assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower’s PD and LGD. This

two-dimensional

credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process on an ongoing basis. These
ratings are reviewed and updated, generally at least once per year. Additionally, no less frequently than on an annual basis, we review PD rates related to each rating grade based upon internal historical data. These rates are updated as needed and
augmented by market data as deemed necessary. For small balance homogeneous pools of commercial loans, mortgages and leases, we apply statistical modeling to assist in determining the probability of default within these pools. Further, on a periodic
basis, we update our LGD estimates associated with each rating grade based upon historical data. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned to commercial loans, capturing both the combination of expectations of default and loss severity in
event of default, reflects the relative estimated likelihood of loss at the reporting date. In general, loans with better PD and LGD

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



tend to have a lower likelihood of loss compared to loans with worse PD and LGD. The loss amount also considers an estimate of exposure at date of default, which we also periodically update based
upon historical data.

Based upon the amount of the lending arrangement and our risk rating assessment, we follow a formal schedule of written
periodic review. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews of a market’s or business unit’s entire loan portfolio, focusing on those loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs and LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is
weakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any customer obligation and its level of credit risk more frequently. We attempt to proactively manage our loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given
loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.

Commercial
Real Estate Loan Class

We manage credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities
similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks connected with commercial real estate projects and

commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and
utilized in assessing credit risk.

As with the commercial class, a formal schedule of periodic review is also performed to assess
market/geographic risk and business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these overviews, more

in-depth

reviews and increased scrutiny are placed on areas of higher risk, including adverse changes in risk
ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that concern management. These reviews are designed to assess risk and take actions to mitigate our exposure to such risks.

Equipment Lease Financing Loan Class

We manage credit risk associated with our equipment
lease financing loan class similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD.

Based upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of
credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic review. Generally, this occurs quarterly, although we have established practices to review such credit risk more frequently if circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of the
following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements, and regulatory compliance.

(a)

Loans are classified as “Pass”, “Special Mention”, “Substandard” and “Doubtful” based on the Regulatory Classification
definitions. We use PDs and LGDs to rate commercial loans and apply a split rating classification to certain loans meeting threshold criteria. By assigning a split classification, a loan’s exposure amount may be split into more than one
classification category in this table.

(b)

Special Mention rated loans have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in
deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date. These loans do not expose us to sufficient risk to warrant a more adverse classification at the reporting date.

(c)

Substandard rated loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct
possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

(d)

Doubtful rated loans possess all the inherent weaknesses of a Substandard loan with the additional characteristics that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in
full improbable due to existing facts, conditions, and values.

Consumer Lending Asset Classes

Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan Classes

We use several credit quality
indicators, including delinquency information, nonperforming loan information, updated credit scores, originated and updated

loan-to-value

(LTV) ratios, and geography,
to monitor and manage credit risk within the home equity and residential real estate loan classes. We evaluate mortgage loan performance by source originators and loan servicers. A summary of asset quality indicators follows:

Delinquency/Delinquency Rates

: We monitor trending of delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential real estate loans. See Table
37 for additional information.

Nonperforming Loans

: We monitor trending of nonperforming loans for home equity and residential real
estate loans. See Table 37 for additional information.

Credit Scores

: We use a national third-party provider to update FICO credit
scores for home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans at least quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan classes.

LTV (inclusive of combined

loan-to-value

(CLTV) for first
and subordinate lien positions)

: At least annually, we update the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For

open-end

credit lines secured by real estate in regions
experiencing significant declines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes.

Historically, we used, and we continue to use, a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes (

e.g.

, line management, loss mitigation strategies).
In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given certain data limitations it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management’s assumptions (

e.g.

, if an updated LTV is not
provided by the third-party service provider, home price index (HPI) changes will be incorporated in arriving at management’s estimate of updated LTV).

Updated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. The related estimates and inputs are based upon an
approach that uses a combination of third-party automated valuation models (AVMs), broker price opinions (BPOs), HPI indices, property location, internal and external balance information, origination data and management assumptions. We generally
utilize origination lien balances provided by a third-party, where applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level
collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by others, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we enhance our methodology.

Geography

: Geographic concentrations are monitored to evaluate and manage exposures. Loan purchase programs are sensitive to, and focused within, certain regions to manage geographic exposures and
associated risks.

A combination of updated FICO scores, originated and updated LTV ratios and geographic location assigned to home equity
loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans is used to monitor the risk in the loan classes. Loans with higher FICO scores and lower LTVs tend to have a lower level of risk. Conversely, loans with lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, and
in certain geographic locations tend to have a higher level of risk.

The following table presents asset quality indicators for home equity
and residential real estate balances, excluding consumer purchased impaired loans of $2.8 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and government insured or guaranteed residential real estate mortgages of
$.8 billion and $.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Amounts shown represent recorded investment.

(b)

Higher risk loans are defined as loans with both an updated FICO score of less than or equal to 660 and an updated LTV greater than or equal to 100%. The following
states had the highest percentage of higher risk loans at December 31, 2016: New Jersey 16%, Pennsylvania 14%, Illinois 12%, Ohio 10%, Florida 7%, Maryland 6%, Michigan 4%, and North Carolina 4%. The remainder of the states had lower than 4% of
the higher risk loans individually, and collectively they represent approximately 27% of the higher risk loans. The following states had the highest percentage of higher risk loans at December 31, 2015: New Jersey 14%, Pennsylvania 12%,
Illinois 11%, Ohio 11%, Florida 7%, Maryland 7% and Michigan 5%. The remainder of the states had lower than 4% of the high risk loans individually, and collectively they represent approximately 33% of the higher risk loans.

Credit Card and Other Consumer Loan Classes

We monitor a variety of asset quality information in the management of the credit card and other consumer loan classes. Other consumer loan classes include education, automobile, and other secured and
unsecured lines and loans. Along with the trending of delinquencies and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are generally obtained monthly, as well as a variety of credit bureau attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a
lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have a higher likelihood of loss.

Table 41: Credit Card and Other Consumer Loan Classes Asset Quality Indicators

(a)

We use updated FICO scores as an asset quality indicator for

non-government

guaranteed or insured education loans, automobile
loans and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. We use internal credit metrics, such as delinquency status, geography or other factors, as an asset quality indicator for government guaranteed or insured education loans and consumer loans to
high net worth individuals, as internal credit metrics are more relevant than FICO scores for these types of loans.

(b)

Credit card loans and other consumer loans with no FICO score available or required generally refers to new accounts issued to borrowers with limited credit history,
accounts for which we cannot obtain an updated FICO score (e.g., recent profile changes), cards issued with a business name, and/or cards secured by collateral. Management proactively assesses the risk and size of this loan portfolio and, when
necessary, takes actions to mitigate the credit risk. Weighted-average updated FICO score excludes accounts with no FICO score available or required.

Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)

A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities, and include rate
reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from borrowers
that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us. In those situations where principal is forgiven, the amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately
charged off.

Some TDRs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest, as restructured, and
result in potential incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate. The level of any subsequent defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. Once a loan becomes a TDR, it
will continue to be reported as a TDR until it is ultimately repaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed upon, or it is fully charged off. We held specific reserves in the ALLL of $.3 billion at both December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, for the total TDR portfolio.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Table 42 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs as well as the change in the
loans’ recorded investment as a result of becoming a TDR during the years 2016, 2015 and 2014. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions. The Principal Forgiveness TDR category includes principal
forgiveness and accrued interest forgiveness. The Rate Reduction TDR category includes reduced interest rate and interest deferral. The Other TDR category primarily includes consumer borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability
through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us, as well as postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and contractual extensions for both consumer and commercial borrowers.

In some cases, there have been multiple concessions granted on one loan. This is most common within the
commercial loan portfolio. When there have been multiple concessions granted in the commercial loan portfolio, the principal forgiveness concession was prioritized for purposes of determining the inclusion in Table 42. Second in priority would be
rate reduction. In the event that multiple concessions are granted on a consumer loan, concessions resulting from discharge from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy without formal affirmation of the loan obligations to us would be
prioritized and included in the Other type of concession in Table 42. After that, consumer loan concessions would follow the previously discussed priority of concessions for the commercial loan portfolio.

Table 42: Financial Impact and TDRs by Concession Type (a)

(a)

Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date are included in this table.

(b)

(c)

Represents the recorded investment of the TDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the TDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.

After a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent restructured terms. We
consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. The recorded investment of loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs or were subsequently modified during
each

12-month

period preceding January 1, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and (ii) subsequently defaulted during the

12-month

period following each of January 1,
2016, 2015 and 2014, totaled $.2 billion, $.1 billion and $.2 billion, respectively.

Impaired Loans

Impaired loans include commercial and consumer nonperforming loans and TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. TDRs that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are now classified and accounted
for as held for sale are also included. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans accounted for as held for sale other than the TDRs described in the preceding sentence, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller
balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. We did not recognize any interest income on impaired loans that have not returned to performing status, while they were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The following table provides further detail on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment and the associated ALLL. Certain commercial and consumer impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as the valuation of these
impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment.

The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility
and liquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in Shareholders’ equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, unless credit-related. Securities held
to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At December 31, 2016, Accumulated other comprehensive income included pretax gains of $96 million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity.
The gains will be accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities.

Table 46 presents gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the
amortized cost basis. The table includes debt securities where a portion of OTTI has been recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The increase in total unrealized losses at December 31, 2016 when compared to
December 31, 2015 was due to an increase in market interest rates.

Evaluating Investment Securities for Other-than-Temporary Impairments

For the securities in Table 46, as of December 31, 2016 we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the securities prior to
recovery of the amortized cost basis.

On at least a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position
for OTTI, as discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies. For those securities on our balance sheet at December 31, 2016, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded
cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities. The majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to

non-agency

residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated BB or lower. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the OTTI credit losses recognized in noninterest income and the OTTI noncredit losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
net of tax, on securities were not significant.

Information relating to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of

Weighted-average yields are based on historical cost with effective yields weighted for the contractual
maturity of each security. At December 31, 2016, there were no securities of a single issuer, other than FNMA, that exceeded 10% of Total shareholders’ equity. The FNMA investments had a total amortized cost of $27.1 billion and fair
value of $26.8 billion.

Fair Value Measurement

We
measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date, determined using an exit
price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring
fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

•

Level

1:

Fair value is determined using a quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1
assets and liabilities may include debt securities, equity securities and listed derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market and certain U.S. Treasury securities that are actively traded in

over-the-counter

markets.

•

Level

2:

Fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for
assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. The majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities, equity securities and listed derivative contracts with quoted prices that are traded in markets that are not active,
and certain

debt and equity securities and

over-the-counter

derivative contracts whose fair value is determined using a pricing
model without significant unobservable inputs.

•

Level

3:

Fair value is estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which the significant valuation inputs are not observable
and the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

We characterize active markets
as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based on current information. Inactive markets are
typically characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants or are not based on current information, wide bid/ask spreads, a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields,
or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuance, or any combination of the above factors. We also consider nonperformance risks
including credit risk as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value, by their nature, result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 inherently require the use of various assumptions, estimates and judgments when measuring
their fair value. As observable market activity is commonly not available to use when estimating the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities, we must estimate fair value using various modeling techniques. These techniques include the use
of a variety of inputs/assumptions including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates or other relevant inputs across the entire population of our Level 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the significant underlying factors or assumptions
(either an increase or a decrease) in any of these areas underlying our estimates may result in a significant increase/decrease in the Level 3 fair value measurement of a particular asset and/or liability from period to period.

Any models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and
internal control testing processes. Our Model Risk Management Committee reviews significant models on at least an annual basis. In addition, the Valuation Committee approves valuation methodologies and reviews the results of independent valuation
reviews and processes for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Securities Available for Sale and Trading Securities

Securities accounted for at fair value include both the available for sale and trading portfolios. We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes, or recent trades to determine the
fair value of securities. The majority of securities were priced by third-party vendors. The third-party vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the
marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. We monitor and validate the reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through pricing methodology reviews, including detailed reviews of the assumptions and inputs used by
the vendor to price individual securities, and through price validation testing. Securities not priced by one of our pricing vendors may be valued using a dealer quote, which are also subject to price validation testing. Price validation testing is
performed independent of the risk-taking function and involves corroborating the prices received from third-party vendors and dealers with prices from another third party or through other sources, such as internal valuations or sales of similar
securities. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon sale of a security.

Securities are classified within the
fair value hierarchy after giving consideration to the activity level in the market for the security type and the observability of the inputs used to determine the fair value. When a quoted price in an active market exists for the identical
security, this price is used to determine fair value and the security is classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities and money-market mutual funds. When a quoted price in an active market
for the identical security is not available, fair value is estimated using either an alternative market approach, such as a recent trade or matrix pricing, or an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow pricing model. If the inputs to the
valuation are based primarily on market observable information, then the security is classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency debt securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and

non-agency

commercial mortgage-backed securities, certain

non-agency

residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities collateralized by

non-mortgage-related

consumer loans, municipal securities, and other debt securities. Level 2 securities are predominantly priced by third parties, either a pricing vendor or dealer.

In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3
of the hierarchy. Securities classified as Level 3 consist primarily of

non-agency

residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by first- and second-lien residential mortgage
loans. Fair value

for these securities is primarily estimated using pricing obtained from third-party vendors. In some cases, fair value is estimated using a dealer quote, by reference to prices of securities of a
similar vintage and collateral type or by reference to recent sales of similar securities. Market activity for these security types is limited with little price transparency. As a result, these securities are generally valued by the third-party
vendor using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates significant unobservable inputs and observable market activity where available. Significant inputs to the valuation include prepayment projections and credit loss assumptions (default
rate and loss severity) and discount rates that are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those assumptions in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

Certain infrequently traded debt securities within Other debt securities

available-for-sale

and Trading securities are also classified in Level 3 and are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in
Table 52. The significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value of these securities include an estimate of expected credit losses and a discount for liquidity risk. These inputs are incorporated into the fair value measurement by
either increasing the spread over the benchmark curve or by applying a credit and liquidity discount to the par value of the security. Significant increases (decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk could result in a significantly lower (higher)
fair value estimate.

Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale

We account for certain residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages with the
related hedges. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market
participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These
adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage
loans held for sale are classified as Level 2.

Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale

We account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale in whole loan transactions at fair value. We determine the fair value of
commercial mortgage loans held for sale based upon discounted cash flows. Fair value is determined using sale valuation assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the loans.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Valuation assumptions may include observable inputs based on the benchmark interest rate swap curves, whole loan sales and agency sales transactions. The significant unobservable inputs are
management’s assumption of the spread applied to the benchmark rate and the estimated servicing cash flows for loans sold to the agencies with servicing retained. The spread over the benchmark curve includes management’s assumptions of the
impact of credit and liquidity risk. Significant increases (decreases) in the spread applied to the benchmark would result in a significantly lower (higher) asset value. The wide range of the spread over the benchmark curve is due to the varying
risk and underlying property characteristics within our portfolio. Significant increases (decreases) in the estimated servicing cash flows would result in significantly higher (lower) asset value. Based on the significance of unobservable inputs, we
classified this portfolio as Level 3.

Loans

Loans accounted for at fair value consist primarily of residential mortgage loans. These loans are generally valued similarly to residential mortgage loans held for sale and are classified as
Level 2. We have elected to account for certain home equity lines of credit at fair value. These loans are classified as Level 3. Significant inputs to the valuation of these loans include credit and liquidity discount, cumulative default
rate, loss severity and gross discount rate and are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these assumptions would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

Equity Investments

The valuation of
direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such investments. Various valuation techniques are used for
direct investments, including multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. A multiple
of adjusted earnings calculation is the valuation technique utilized most frequently and is the most significant unobservable input used in such calculation. Significant decreases (increases) in the multiple of earnings could result in a
significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Direct equity investments are classified as Level 3.

Indirect investments are not
redeemable; however, we receive distributions over the life of the partnerships from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee, which we expect to occur over the next twelve years. We value indirect investments in private equity
funds using consensus pricing and the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient as provided in the financial statements that we receive from fund managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based

on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager-provided value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates
a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. Indirect investments valued using NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)

MSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring basis.
Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs valuation model reflect management’s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales of MSRs do occur, MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with
readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available.

Residential MSRs

As a benchmark for the reasonableness of our residential MSRs fair value, we obtained opinions of value from independent brokers. These brokers provided a
range

(+/-10 bps)

based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflect conditions in the secondary market and any recently executed servicing transactions. We compare our
internally-developed residential MSRs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers’ ranges, management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted. For the
periods presented, our residential MSRs value did not fall outside of the brokers’ ranges. We consider our residential MSRs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified as Level 3. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are
constant prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve. Significant increases (decreases) in prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve would result in lower (higher) fair market value of residential MSRs.

Commercial MSRs

The fair value of
commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors. Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs and the
limited availability of market pricing, commercial MSRs are classified as Level 3. Significant increases  (decreases) in constant prepayment rates and discount rates would result in significantly lower  (higher) commercial
MSR value determined based on current market conditions and expectations.

Financial Derivatives

Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. The majority of derivatives that we enter into are
executed

over-the-counter

and are valued using internal models. These derivatives are


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


primarily classified as Level 2 as the readily observable market inputs to these models are validated to external sources such as industry pricing services, or are corroborated through
recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market-related data. Level 2 financial derivatives are primarily estimated using a combination of Eurodollar future prices and observable benchmark interest rate swaps to
construct projected discounted cash flows.

Financial derivatives that are priced using significant management judgment or assumptions are
classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs related to interest rate contracts include probability of funding of residential mortgage loan commitments, spread over the benchmark interest rate and the estimated servicing cash flows of commercial
mortgage loan commitments, and expected interest rate volatility of interest rate options. Probability of default and loss severity are the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of risk participation agreements. The fair values of
Level 3 assets and liabilities related to these financial derivatives as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 52 of this Note 6.

In connection with the sales of portions of our Visa Class B common shares, we entered into swap agreements with the purchasers of the shares to
account for any future risk of converting Class B common shares to Class A common shares and to account for the corresponding change in value to the Class B shares. These adjustments result from resolution of the specified litigation
or the changes in the amount in the litigation escrow account funded by Visa as well as from changes in the estimated litigation resolution date (see Note 19 Legal Proceedings). These swaps also require payments calculated by reference to the market
price of the Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. An increase in the estimated growth rate of the Class A share price or the estimated length of litigation resolution date, or a decrease in the estimated conversion rate,
will have a negative impact on the fair value of the swaps and vice versa, through its impact on periodic payments due to the counterparty until the maturity dates of the swaps.

The fair values of our derivatives include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect our own and our counterparties’ nonperformance risk. Our CVA is computed using new loan pricing and considers
externally available bond spreads, in conjunction with internal historical recovery observations.

Other Assets and Liabilities

Other assets held at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock and assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans.

We have elected to account for the shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock received in a stock exchange with BlackRock at fair value as
these shares economically hedge the BlackRock LTIP liability that is accounted for and reported as a derivative. The fair value of the Series C Preferred Stock is determined using a third-party modeling approach, which includes both observable and
unobservable inputs. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, this security is classified as Level 3. Significant increases (decreases) in the liquidity discount would result in a lower (higher) asset value for the BlackRock Series C
Preferred Stock.

The assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans primarily consist of a
prepaid forward contract referencing an amount of shares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and fixed income funds, and are valued based on the underlying investments. These assets are valued either by reference to the market price of PNC’s
stock or by using the quoted market prices for investments other than PNC’s stock and are primarily classified in Levels 1 and 2.

All
Level 3 other assets and liabilities, excluding the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 52 in this Note 6.

Other Borrowed Funds

Other borrowed
funds primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities sold short classified as Level 1. Other borrowed funds also includes the related liability for certain repurchased loans for which we have elected the fair value option and are classified as
either Level 2 or Level 3, consistent with the level classification of the corresponding loans. All Level 3 amounts are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 52 in this Note 6.

An instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. Our policy is to
recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period.

Financial Assets Accounted for at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

We may be required to measure certain financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the
application of lower of amortized cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment and are included in Table 53 and Table 54.

Nonaccrual Loans

Nonaccrual loans represent the fair value of those loans which have been
adjusted due to impairment. The impairment is primarily based on the appraised value of the collateral or LGD percentage. The LGD percentage represents the amount that we expect to lose in the event a borrower defaults on an

obligation and is used to determine the weighted average loss severity of the nonaccrual loans.

Appraisals are obtained by licensed or certified appraisers at least annually and more recently in certain instances. All third-party appraisals are reviewed and any adjustments to the initial appraisal
are incorporated into the final issued appraisal report. In instances where an appraisal is not obtained, collateral value is determined consistent with external third-party appraisal standards by an internal person independent of the asset manager.
If an appraisal is outdated due to changed project or market conditions, or if the net book value is utilized, management uses an LGD percentage.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


OREO and Foreclosed Assets

The carrying value of OREO and foreclosed assets includes valuation adjustments recorded subsequent to the transfer to OREO and foreclosed assets. Valuation adjustments are based on the fair value less
cost to sell of the property. Fair value is based on appraised value or sales price and the appraisal process for OREO and foreclosed properties is the same as described above for nonaccrual loans.

Insignificant Assets

Insignificant
assets represent the aggregate amount of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that are individually and in

Financial Instruments Accounted for under Fair Value Option

We elect the fair value option to account for certain financial instruments. For more information on these financial instruments for which the fair value
option election has been made, please refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 6. These financial instruments are initially measured at fair value, gains and losses from initial measurement and any changes in fair value are
subsequently recognized in earnings.

Interest income related to changes in the fair values of these financial instruments is recorded on the
Consolidated Income Statement in Other interest income, except for certain Residential mortgage loans, for which income is also recorded in Loan interest income. Changes in value on the prepaid forward contract included in Other Assets is reported
in Noninterest expense and interest expense on the Other borrowed funds is reported in Borrowed funds interest expense.

Additional Fair Value Information Related to Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value

This section presents fair value information for all other financial instruments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. We
used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value amounts for these financial instruments.

Cash and Due from Banks and
Interest-earning Deposits with Banks

Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts for Cash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning
Deposits with Banks reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value.

Securities Held to Maturity

We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. Refer to the Fair Value
Measurement section of this Note 6 for additional information relating to our pricing processes and procedures.

Net Loans

Fair values are estimated based on the discounted value of expected net cash flows incorporating assumptions about prepayment rates, net credit losses and
servicing fees. Nonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated recovery value. Loans are presented net of the ALLL.

Other Assets

Other assets includes accrued interest receivable, cash collateral, federal funds sold and resale agreements, equity investments carried at cost, certain loans held for sale, and FHLB and FRB stock. The
aggregate carrying value of our FHLB and FRB stock was $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2015, which approximated fair value at each date.

Deposits

For deposits with no defined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing and
interest-bearing demand and interest-bearing money market and savings deposits, carrying values approximate fair values. For time deposits, fair values are estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments
with similar maturities.

Borrowed Funds

For short-term borrowings, including Federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and certain other short-term borrowings and payables, carrying values approximated fair values. For
long-term borrowed funds, quoted market prices are used, when available, to estimate fair value. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with similar
terms and maturities.

Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit

The fair value of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined from a market participant’s view including the impact of changes in interest rates and credit. Because our obligation
on substantially all unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit varies with changes in interest rates, these instruments are subject to little fluctuation in fair value due to changes in interest rates. We establish a liability on these
facilities related to the creditworthiness of our counterparty.

Other Liabilities

Other liabilities includes interest-bearing cash collateral held related to derivatives and other accrued liabilities. Due to its short term nature, the
carrying value of Other liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.

methodologies. Based on the results of our analysis, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2016, 2015 or 2014.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

We
recognize the right to service mortgage loans for others when we recognize it as an intangible asset and the servicing income we receive is more than adequate compensation. MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing
retained. MSRs totaled $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value.

Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights

We
recognize gains/(losses) on changes in the fair value of commercial MSRs. Commercial MSRs are subject to declines in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We
manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of commercial MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of commercial MSRs declines (or increases).

The fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating inputs
for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors determined based on current market conditions and expectations.

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights

Residential MSRs are subject to declines in value
from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of residential MSRs with securities and derivative instruments
which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of residential MSRs declines (or increases).

The fair value of
residential MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount
rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions.

Sensitivity Analysis

The fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant
inputs to the valuation models as of December 31, 2016 are shown in Tables 61 and 62. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models
and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management
judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived
from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value
estimate.

A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented in
Tables 61 and 62. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be
linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example,
changes in mortgage interest

rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair
value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions:

Junior Subordinated Debentures

PNC Capital Trust C, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of PNC, owns junior subordinated debentures issued by PNC with a carrying value of
$205 million. In June 1998, PNC Capital Trust C issued $200 million of trust preferred securities which bear interest at an annual rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 57 basis points. The trust preferred securities are currently redeemable by PNC
Capital Trust C at par. In accordance with GAAP, the financial statements of the Trust are not included in our consolidated financial statements.

The obligations of PNC, as the parent of the Trust, when taken collectively, are the equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of the Trust under the terms of the trust preferred
securities. Such guarantee is subordinate in right of payment in the same manner as other junior subordinated debt. There are certain restrictions on our overall ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries. For additional disclosure on these
funding restrictions, see Note 18 Regulatory Matters. PNC and PNC Bank are also subject to restrictions on dividends and other provisions potentially imposed by the REIT preferred securities, including under the Exchange Agreement with PNC Preferred
Funding Trust II, as described in Note 15 Equity.

We are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments, in connection with the
outstanding junior subordinated debentures. Generally, if there is (i) an event of default under the debenture, (ii) we elect to defer interest on the debenture, (iii) we exercise our right to defer payments on the related trust
preferred securities, or (iv) there is a default under our guarantee of such payment obligations, then we would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of
the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreement with PNC Preferred Funding Trust II, as described in Note 15 Equity.

Pension and Postretirement Plans

We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where
earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Earnings credit percentages for those employees who were plan participants on December 31, 2009 are frozen at the level earned to that point. Earnings credits for all employees who
became participants on or after January 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible compensation. All plan participants earn interest on their cash balances based on

30-year

Treasury securities rates with those who
were participants at December 31, 2009 earning a minimum rate. New participants on or after January 1, 2010 are not subject to the minimum rate. Any pension contributions to the plan are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary
to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. We made voluntary contributions of $.3 billion and $.2 billion in December 2016 and February 2015, respectively, to the qualified pension plan.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health
care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension plan is unfunded.
Contributions from PNC and, in the case of the postretirement benefit plans, participant contributions cover all benefits paid under the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plan provides benefits to certain
retirees that are at least actuarially equivalent to those provided by Medicare Part D and accordingly, we receive a federal subsidy as shown in Table 70. In November of 2015, we established a voluntary employee beneficiary association (VEBA) to
partially fund postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations.

We use a measurement date of December 31 for plan assets
and benefit obligations. A reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation for qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as the change in plan assets for the qualified pension plan follows.

Table 70:

Reconciliation of Changes in Projected Benefit Obligation and Change in Plan Assets

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



At December 31, 2016, the fair value of the qualified pension plan assets was more than both the
accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation.

PNC Pension Plan Assets

The long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets in our qualified pension plan (the Plan) is to:

•

Meet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries,

•

Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust and the Plan,

•

Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and

•

Provide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment return, at an appropriate
level of risk.

The Plan’s named investment fiduciary has the ability to make short to intermediate term asset
allocation shifts under the dynamic asset allocation strategy based on factors such as the Plan’s funded status, the named investment fiduciary’s view of return on equities relative to long term expectations, the named investment
fiduciary’s view on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads, and other relevant financial or economic factors which would be expected to impact the ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to participants and beneficiaries.
Accordingly, the allowable asset allocation ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility required by the dynamic allocation policy.

The asset strategy allocations for the Trust at the end of 2016 and 2015, and the target allocation range at the end of 2016, by asset category, are as
follows.

Table 71:

Asset Strategy Allocations

The asset category represents the allocation of Plan assets in accordance with the investment objective of
each of the Plan’s investment managers. Certain domestic equity investment managers utilize derivatives and fixed income securities as described in their Investment Management Agreements to achieve their investment objective under the
Investment Policy Statement. Other investment managers may invest in eligible securities outside of their assigned asset category to meet their investment objectives. The actual percentage of the fair value of total Plan assets held as of
December 31, 2016 for equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate and all other assets are 65%, 19%, 5% and 11%, respectively.

We believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will deviate from the target
percentages due to market movement, cash flows, investment manager performance and implementation of shifts under the dynamic asset allocation policy. Material deviations from the asset allocation targets can alter the expected return and risk of
the Trust. On the other hand, frequent rebalancing of the asset allocation targets may result in significant transaction costs, which can impair the Trust’s ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is
periodically rebalanced to maintain asset allocation within the target ranges described above.

In addition to being diversified across asset
classes, the Trust is diversified within each asset class. Secondary diversification provides a reasonable basis for the expectation that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of
the Trust.

Where investment strategies permit the use of derivatives and/or currency management, language is incorporated in the
managers’ guidelines to define allowable and prohibited transactions and/or strategies. Derivatives are typically employed by investment managers to modify risk/return characteristics of their portfolio(s), implement asset allocation changes in
a cost effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. Under the managers’ investment guidelines, derivatives may not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are to be used only in circumstances where they offer the most
efficient economic means of improving the risk/reward profile of the portfolio.

Fair Value Measurements

As further described in Note 6 Fair Value, GAAP establishes the framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value.

A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 follows:

•

Money market funds are valued at the net asset value of the shares held by the pension plan at year end.

•

U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt and common stock are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the
individual securities are traded. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Such securities are generally
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy but may be a Level 3 depending on the level of liquidity and activity in the market for the security.

•

Other investments held by the pension plan include derivative financial instruments, which are recorded at estimated fair value as determined by
third-party appraisals and pricing models, and group annuity contracts, which are measured at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations considering the credit-worthiness
of the issuer. Also included in other investments is preferred stock valued at the closing price reported on an active market on which the securities are traded.

•

Investments measured at net asset value include collective trust fund investments and limited partnerships. Collective trust fund investments are
valued based upon the units of such collective trust fund held by the Plan at year end multiplied by the respective unit value. The unit value of the collective trust fund is based upon significant observable inputs, although it is not based upon
quoted marked prices in an active market. The underlying investments of the collective trust funds consist primarily of equity securities, debt obligations, short-term investments, and other marketable securities. Due to the nature of these
securities, there are no unfunded commitments or redemption restrictions. Limited partnerships are valued by investment managers based on recent financial information used to estimate fair value. The unit value of limited partnerships is based upon
significant observable inputs, although it is not based upon quoted marked prices in an active market. In accordance with ASC 820-10, collective trust fund investments and limited partnerships are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

These methods may result in fair value calculations that may not be indicative of net realizable values or future fair
values. Furthermore, while the pension plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments
could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The qualified pension plan contributions are deposited into the Trust, and the qualified pension plan benefit payments
are paid from the Trust. Notwithstanding the contributions, we do not expect to be required to make a contribution to the qualified plan for 2017 based on the funding calculations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For the other plans, total
contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent expected benefit amounts, which are paid from general assets. Postretirement benefits are net of participant contributions. Estimated cash flows reflect the partial funding of
postretirement medical and life insurance obligations in the VEBA.

The discount rates are determined independently for each plan by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid
under each plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. For this analysis, 10% of bonds with the highest yields and 40% with the lowest yields were removed from the bond universe.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and
anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. For purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, “long term” refers to the period over which
the plan’s projected benefit obligations will be disbursed. We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. Our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily
utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations. We also examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies. Taking into account all of these factors, the expected long-term return on plan
assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2016 was 6.75%. We are reducing our expected long-term return on assets to 6.375% for determining pension cost for 2017. This decision was made after considering the views of both internal and
external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective equity and fixed income returns.

PNC’s net periodic benefit cost recognized for the plans is sensitive to the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. With all other assumptions held constant, a .5% decline in the
discount rate would have resulted in an immaterial increase in net periodic benefit cost for the qualified pension plan in 2016, and to be recognized in 2017. For the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefits, a .5% decline in the
discount rate would also have resulted in an immaterial increase in net periodic benefit cost.

The health care cost trend rate assumptions
shown in Tables 75 and 76 relate only to the postretirement benefit plans. The effect of a

one-percentage-point

increase or decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would be insignificant.

Defined Contribution Plans

The
PNC Incentive Savings Plan (ISP) is a qualified defined contribution plan that covers all of our eligible employees. Effective January 1, 2015, newly-hired full time employees and part-time employees who became eligible to participate in the
ISP after that date are automatically enrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal to 4% of eligible compensation in the absence of an affirmative election otherwise. Employee benefits expense related to the ISP was $.1 billion in 2016, 2015
and 2014, representing cash contributed to the ISP by PNC.

The ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes an employee stock ownership (ESOP) feature.
Employee contributions are invested in a number of investment options, including pre mixed portfolios and individual core funds, available under the ISP at the direction of the employee.

We have long-term incentive award plans (Incentive Plans) that provide for the granting
of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, incentive shares/performance units, restricted shares, restricted share units, other share-based awards and dollar-denominated awards to executives and, other than
incentive stock options, to

non-employee

directors. Certain Incentive Plan awards may be paid in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We typically grant a substantial portion of our stock-based
compensation awards during the first quarter of each year.

Total compensation expense recognized related to all share-based payment
arrangements was approximately $.2 billion during each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. The total tax benefit recognized related to compensation expense on all share-based payment arrangements was approximately $.1 billion during each of 2016, 2015
and 2014. At December 31, 2016, there was $.2 billion of unamortized share-based compensation expense related to nonvested equity compensation arrangements granted under the Incentive Plans. This unamortized cost is expected to be
recognized as expense over a period of no longer than five years.

Nonqualified Stock Options

We did not grant any stock options in 2016, 2015 or 2014. Prior to 2014, options were granted at exercise prices not less than the market value of a share
of common stock on the grant date. Generally, options become exercisable in installments after the grant date. No option can be exercised after 10 years from its grant date. Payment of the option exercise price may be in cash or by surrendering
shares of common stock at market value on the exercise date. The exercise price may also be paid by using previously owned shares.

The
following table represents the stock option activity for 2016.

To determine stock-based compensation expense, the grant date fair value is applied to the options granted with a reduction for estimated forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for stock options
on a straight-line basis over the specified vesting period.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


At December 31, 2015 and 2014, options for 5 million and 6 million shares of common stock
were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $55.42 and $56.21, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was approximately $.1 billion during 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Cash received from option exercises under all Incentive Plans for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $.1 billion, $.1 billion and $.2 billion, respectively. The tax benefit realized from
option exercises under all Incentive Plans was insignificant for 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Shares of common stock available during the next year
for the granting of options and other awards under the Incentive Plans were approximately 39 million shares at December 31, 2016. Total shares of PNC common stock authorized for future issuance under all equity compensation plans totaled
approximately 40 million shares at December 31, 2016.

During 2016, we issued approximately 2 million common shares from
treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity. As with past exercise activity, we currently intend to utilize primarily treasury stock for any future stock option exercises.

Incentive/Performance Unit Awards and Restricted Share/Restricted Share Unit Awards

The fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit awards and restricted share/restricted share unit awards is initially determined based on prices
not less than the market value of our common stock on the date of grant with a reduction for estimated forfeitures. The value of certain incentive/performance unit awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial
and other performance goals. Additionally, certain incentive/performance unit awards require subsequent adjustment to their current market value due to certain discretionary risk review triggers.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/performance unit awards and restricted share/restricted share unit awards granted in 2016, 2015
and 2014 was $78.37, $91.57 and $80.79 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of incentive/performance unit and restricted share/restricted share unit awards vested during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $.1 billion,
$.2 billion and $.1 billion, respectively. We recognize compensation expense for such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or performance periods for each type of program.

BlackRock Long-term Incentive Plans (LTIP)

BlackRock adopted the 2002 LTIP program to help attract and retain qualified professionals. At that time, we agreed to transfer up to four million shares of BlackRock common stock to fund a portion of the
2002 LTIP program and future LTIP programs approved by BlackRock’s Board of Directors.

In 2009, our obligation to deliver any remaining
BlackRock common shares was replaced with an obligation to deliver shares of BlackRock’s Series C Preferred Stock held by us.

In 2016,
we transferred .5 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock to BlackRock in connection with our obligation. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately .8 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock which were
available to fund our obligations. See Note 23 Subsequent Events for information on our February 1, 2017 transfer of .5 million shares of the Series C Preferred Stock to BlackRock to satisfy a portion of our LTIP obligation.

We account for our BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock at fair value, which offsets the impact of

marking-to-market

the obligation to deliver these shares to BlackRock. See Note 6 Fair Value for additional information regarding the valuation of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock.

ERIVATIVES

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk and reduce the effects
that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Derivatives represent contracts between
parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.

Derivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not recorded on the balance
sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate (commonly LIBOR), security price, credit spread or other index.
Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments.

The
following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us:

All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are
presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion
regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features section below. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is
included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives.

Further discussion on how derivatives are accounted for is
included in Note 1 Accounting Policies.

Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP

Certain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as
accounting hedges under GAAP. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash
flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives, to the extent effective, to be
recognized in the income statement in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.

Fair Value Hedges

We enter into receive-fixed,

pay-variable

interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding
fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into

pay-fixed,

receive-variable interest rate swaps and

zero-coupon

swaps to hedge
changes in the fair value of fixed rate and

zero-coupon

investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. For these hedge relationships, we use statistical regression analysis to assess
hedge effectiveness at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all periods presented.

Further detail regarding gains (losses) on fair value hedge derivatives and related hedged items is presented in the following table:

Table 80:

Gains (Losses) on Derivatives and Related Hedged Items – Fair Value Hedges (a)

(a)

The difference between the gains (losses) recognized in income on derivatives and their related hedged items represents the ineffective portion of the change in value
of our fair value hedge derivatives.

(b)

The gains (losses) on derivatives and their related hedged items recognized in income were less than $.5 million.

Cash Flow Hedges

We enter into
receive-fixed,

pay-variable

interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows
due to market interest rate changes. For these cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are effective in offsetting changes in the forecasted interest cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income
and are reclassified to interest income in conjunction with the recognition of interest received on the loans. We use statistical regression analysis to assess the effectiveness of these hedge relationships at both the inception of the hedge
relationship and on an ongoing basis.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the
consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. As a result, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is
typically minimal. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings.

In the 12 months that follow December 31, 2016, we expect to reclassify net derivative gains of $186 million pretax, or $120 million

after-tax,

from Accumulated other

comprehensive income to interest income for both cash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge

de-designations,

and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is five years. During
2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to earnings because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.

There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to either cash flow hedge strategy for
all periods presented.

Net Investment Hedges

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge

non-U.S.

Dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates.
We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the
hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for all
periods presented. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, there was no net investment hedge ineffectiveness. Net gains on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were $186 million in 2016, $60 million in 2015 and $54 million in 2014.

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP

Residential mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market, and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the
loans and commitments due to interest rate risk are hedged with forward contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities, as well as U.S. Treasury and

Eurodollar futures and options. Gains and losses on the loans and commitments held for sale and the derivatives used to economically hedge them are included in Residential mortgage noninterest
income on the Consolidated Income Statement.

Residential mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value
influenced primarily by changes in interest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities. Gains
and losses on residential mortgage servicing rights and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in Residential mortgage noninterest income.

Commercial mortgage loans held for sale and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge these loans and
commitments from changes in fair value due to interest rate risk and credit risk include forward loan sale contracts, interest rate swaps, and credit default swaps. Gains and losses on the commitments, loans and derivatives are included in Other
noninterest income. Derivatives used to economically hedge the change in value of commercial mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


and options. Gains or losses on these derivatives are included in Corporate services noninterest income.

The residential and commercial mortgage loan commitments associated with loans to be sold which are accounted for as derivatives are valued based on the estimated fair value of the underlying loan and the
probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment. The fair value also takes into account the fair value of the embedded servicing right.

We offer derivatives to our customers in connection with their risk management needs. These derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions and foreign
exchange contracts. We primarily manage our market risk exposure from customer transactions by entering into a variety of hedging transactions with third-party dealers. Gains and losses on customer-related derivatives are included in Other
noninterest income.

Included in the customer, mortgage banking risk management, and other risk management portfolios are
written interest-rate caps and floors entered into with customers and for risk management purposes. We receive an upfront premium from the counterparty and are obligated to make payments to the counterparty if the underlying market interest rate
rises above or falls below a certain level designated in the contract. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions.

We have entered into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate
revenue. The notional amount of risk participation agreements sold was $4.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2015. Assuming all underlying third party customers referenced in the swap contracts
defaulted, the exposure from these agreements would be $.1 billion at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 based on the fair value of the underlying swaps.

Further detail regarding the gains
(losses) on derivatives not designated in hedging relationships is presented in the following table:

Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features

We, generally, utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties
under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the
occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party’s net position. In certain cases, minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any
collateral is exchanged. Collateral is typically exchanged daily based on the net fair value of the positions with the counterparty as of the preceding day. Collateral representing initial margin, which is based on potential future exposure, is also
required to be pledged by us in relation to derivative instruments with central clearing house counterparties. Any cash collateral exchanged with counterparties under these master netting agreements is also netted, when appropriate, against the
applicable derivative fair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, the fair value of any securities held or pledged is not included in the net presentation on the balance sheet. In order for derivative instruments under a master netting
agreement to be eligible for closeout netting under

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



GAAP, we must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis that the offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement would be legally enforceable upon an event
of default, including upon an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding of the counterparty. Enforceability is evidenced by a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement
in such circumstances.

Table 83 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative
liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or
pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.

Table 83 includes

over-the-counter

(OTC) derivatives, cleared derivatives, and exchange-traded derivatives. OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties
that are not settled through an organized exchange or cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by ISDA documentation or other legally enforceable industry standard master netting agreements. Cleared
derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. Exchange-traded derivatives represent standardized futures and options
contracts executed directly on an organized exchange.

In addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to
reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.

At December 31, 2016, we held cash, U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling $1.0 billion under master netting
agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $1.3 billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and
to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals

may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair
values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is
included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise securities we have pledged to
counterparties remain on our balance sheet.

Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as
those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request
immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net
liability position on December 31, 2016 was $1.0 billion for which we had posted collateral of $.6 billion in the normal course of business. The maximum additional amount of collateral we would have been required to post if the
credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2016 would be $.4 billion.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Our Series K preferred stock was issued on May 21, 2008. Dividends were paid at a rate of 8.25% until
May 21, 2013 and at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 422 basis points beginning May 21, 2013. On May 4, 2015, we redeemed all 500,000 depositary shares representing interests in our Series K preferred stock and all 50,000 shares
of Series K preferred stock underlying such depositary shares, resulting in a net outflow of $500 million.

We have authorized but
unissued Series H and Series I preferred stock. As described below in the Perpetual Trust Securities portion of the Noncontrolling Interests section of this Note, the PNC Preferred Funding Trust II securities are automatically exchangeable into
shares of PNC Series I preferred stock under certain conditions relating to the capitalization or the financial condition of PNC Bank and upon the direction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Series A preferred stock of PNC
REIT Corp. is also automatically exchangeable under similar conditions into shares of PNC Series H preferred stock.

Warrants

We had 11.3 million and 13.4 million warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The reduction
was due to 2.1 million warrants that were exercised during 2016. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of PNC common stock at an exercise price of $67.33 per share. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, the warrants are
exercised on a

non-cash

net basis with the warrant holder receiving PNC common shares determined based on the excess of the market price of PNC common stock on the exercise date over the exercise price of the
warrant. In 2016, we issued 0.7 million common shares resulting from the exercise of the warrants. The issuance of these shares resulted in a reclassification within Capital surplus with no impact on our Shareholders’ equity. These
warrants were sold by the U.S. Treasury in a secondary public offering that closed on May 5, 2010 after the U.S. Treasury exchanged its TARP Warrant (issued on December 31, 2008 under the TARP Capital Purchase Program) for
16.9 million warrants. These warrants expire December 31, 2018.

Other Shareholders’ Equity Matters

We have a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. Holders of PNC common stock may participate in the plan, which provides that additional shares of
common stock may be purchased at market value with reinvested dividends and voluntary cash payments. Common shares issued pursuant to this plan were 0.3 million shares for 2016, 2015 and 2014.

At December 31, 2016, we had reserved approximately 119 million common shares to be issued in connection with certain stock plans.

We repurchased 4.4 million shares in 2015 under the stock repurchase program that the Board of Directors approved

effective October 4, 2007. Effective March 31, 2015, the Board of Directors terminated this share repurchase program and effective April 1, 2015 the Board of Directors replaced it
with a new stock repurchase program authorization in the amount of up to 100 million shares of PNC common stock which may be purchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Under this program, we repurchased
17.9 million shares in 2015 and 22.8 million shares in 2016. A maximum amount of 59.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under this program at December 31, 2016. This program will remain in effect until fully
utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated.

Noncontrolling Interests

Perpetual Trust Securities

Fixed-to-Floating

Rate

Non-Cumulative

Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities (the “Trust I Securities”) of PNC Preferred Funding Trust I (“Trust I”), in a private placement. PNC REIT Corp. had previously acquired the Trust I Securities from the trust in exchange for
an equivalent amount of

Fixed-to-Floating

Rate

Non-Cumulative

Perpetual Preferred Securities (the “LLC Preferred
Securities”), of PNC Preferred Funding LLC, (the “LLC”), held by PNC REIT Corp. The LLC’s initial material assets consist of indirect interests in mortgages and mortgage-related assets previously owned by PNC REIT Corp. The rate
on these securities at December 31, 2016 was 2.613%.

In March 2007, the LLC, sold $500 million of 6.113%

Fixed-to-Floating

Rate

Non-Cumulative

Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities (the “Trust II Securities”) of PNC Preferred
Funding Trust II (“Trust II”) in a private placement. In connection with the private placement, Trust II acquired $500 million of LLC Preferred Securities, from the LLC. The rate on these securities at December 31, 2016 was
2.186%.

The Trust I Securities and Trust II Securities are redeemable in whole or in part at par ($100,000 per security), plus any declared
and unpaid dividends to the redemption date, on the quarterly dividend payment date in March 2017 and on the March quarterly dividend payment date in each fifth succeeding year (each, a “Five Year Date”).

The Trust I Securities and Trust II Securities are also redeemable in whole, but not in part, on any quarterly dividend payment date that is not a Five
Year Date at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (i) the greater of (A) $100,000 per security or (B) the sum of present values of $100,000 per security and all undeclared dividends for the dividend periods from the redemption date
to and including the next succeeding Five Year Date, discounted to the redemption date on a quarterly basis at the

3-month

USD LIBOR rate applicable to the dividend period immediately preceding such redemption
date plus (ii) any declared and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



The Trust I Securities and Trust II Securities are also redeemable in whole, but not in part, on any
quarterly dividend payment date that is not a Five Year Date in the case of certain tax, investment company or regulatory capital events at a redemption price of par plus declared and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

Upon certain conditions relating to the capitalization or the financial condition of PNC Bank and upon the direction of the OCC, the Trust I Securities
are automatically exchangeable into shares of Series F preferred stock of PNC Bank and the Trust II Securities are automatically exchangeable into shares of Series I preferred stock of PNC.

Any redemption is subject to compliance with the applicable Replacement Capital Covenant (see Table 87) and approval of the OCC.

PNC REIT Corp. owns 100% of the LLC’s common voting securities. As a result, the LLC is an indirect subsidiary of PNC and is consolidated on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Trust I and Trust
II’s investment in the LLC Preferred Securities is characterized as a noncontrolling interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since we are not the primary beneficiary of Trust I and Trust II. This noncontrolling interest totaled
$1.0 billion at December 31, 2016.

Information related to the capital covenants and contractual commitments of the perpetual trust
securities, including limitations potentially imposed on PNC and PNC Bank’s payment of dividends on their respective equity capital securities, follows.

The majority of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2032 and were insignificant at December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. All federal and most state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are from acquired entities and utilization is subject to various statutory limitations. We anticipate that we will be able to fully utilize our
carryforwards for federal tax purposes, but we have recorded an insignificant valuation allowance against certain state tax carryforwards as of December 31, 2016. If select uncertain tax positions were successfully challenged by a state, the
state net operating losses listed in Table 94 could be reduced by an insignificant amount.

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately
$.1 billion of earnings attributed to foreign subsidiaries that have been indefinitely reinvested for which no incremental U.S. income tax provision has been recorded.

Retained earnings included $.1 billion at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in allocations for bad debt deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been
provided. Under current law, if certain subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other

than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to Federal income tax at the current corporate tax rate.

It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease in the next twelve
months due to completion of tax authorities’ exams or the expiration of statutes of limitations; however, the estimated amount is insignificant.

We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in most states and some foreign jurisdictions. Table 96 summarizes the status of significant IRS examinations of us.

In addition, we are under continuous examinations by various state taxing authorities. With few exceptions, we are no
longer subject to state and local and foreign income tax examinations by taxing authorities for periods before 2011. For all open audits, any potential adjustments have been considered in establishing our unrecognized tax benefits as of
December 31, 2016.

Our policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with income taxes as income tax expense. For 2016 and
2015, the amount of gross interest and penalties was insignificant. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the related amounts of accrued interest and penalties was also insignificant.

We are subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergo periodic examinations by such regulatory
authorities.

The ability to undertake new business initiatives (including acquisitions), the access to and cost of funding for new business
initiatives, the ability to pay dividends, the ability to repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s
capital strength.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, PNC and PNC Bank, our domestic banking subsidiary, were both
considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements.

The following table sets forth the
Transitional Basel III regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2016 and December

(a)

Calculated using the Transitional Basel III regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during both 2016 and 2015.

The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following:

•

Capital needs,

•

Laws and regulations,

•

Corporate policies,

•

Contractual restrictions, and

•

Other factors.

Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or
make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016.

Under federal law, a bank subsidiary generally may not extend credit to, or engage in other types of covered transactions (including the purchase of
assets) with, the parent company or its

non-bank

subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances that are not substantially the same as comparable transactions with nonaffiliates. A bank subsidiary may not
extend credit to, or engage in a covered transaction with, the parent company or a

non-bank

subsidiary if the aggregate amount of the bank’s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the
parent company or

non-bank

subsidiary exceeds 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or the aggregate amount of the bank’s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with
the parent company and all

non-bank

subsidiaries exceeds 20% of the capital and surplus of such bank subsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be at least fully collateralized in
accordance with specified collateralization thresholds, with the thresholds varying based on the type of assets serving as collateral. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive limitations.

Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). At December 31, 2016,
the balance outstanding at the FRB was $25.1 billion.

ROCEEDINGS

We establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental
investigations and inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter
as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for
disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are those matters disclosed in this Note 19). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of December 31, 2016, we
estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $475 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of
currently available information and are subject to significant


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of
outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly
significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.

In our experience, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. One
or more of the following factors frequently contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action
will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if permitted to proceed as a class action, how the class will be defined; the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of regulatory and
governmental investigations and inquiries, the possibility of fines and penalties); the matter presents meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; we have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions; discovery has not
started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; the possible outcomes may not be amenable to the use of statistical or quantitative analytical tools; predicting possible outcomes depends on making assumptions about future
decisions of courts or regulatory bodies or the behavior of other parties; and there are a large number of parties named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants).
Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we could incur.

As a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such
losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the
Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as
discussed below under “Other.”

We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative
information related to the plaintiff’s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff’s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential
magnitude of a matter, it

does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.

Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals
(although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.

Interchange Litigation

Beginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust lawsuits were filed against Visa, MasterCard, and several major financial institutions, including cases naming National City (since merged into PNC) and its
subsidiary, National City Bank of Kentucky (since merged into National City Bank which in turn was merged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these cases are merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S., as well as trade associations.
Some of these cases (including those naming National City entities) were brought as class actions on behalf of all persons or business entities that have accepted Visa

or MasterCard

®

. The cases
have been consolidated for

pre-trial

proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption

In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount
Antitrust Litigation

(Master File

No. 1:05-md-1720-JG-JO).

In July 2012, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding with the class plaintiffs and an agreement in principle with certain individual
plaintiffs with respect to a settlement of these cases, under which the defendants agreed to pay approximately $6.6 billion collectively to the class and individual settling plaintiffs and agreed to changes in the terms applicable to their
respective card networks (including an eight-month reduction in default credit interchange rates). The parties entered into a definitive agreement with respect to this settlement in October 2012. The court granted final approval of the settlement in
December 2013. Several objectors appealed the order of approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an order in June 2016, reversing approval of the settlement and remanding for further proceedings. In November 2016,
the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge the court of appeal’s decision, which is still pending.

As a result of the reversal of the approval of the settlement, the class actions have resumed in the district court. In November 2016, the district court appointed separate interim class counsel for a
proposed class seeking damages and a proposed class seeking equitable (injunctive) relief. In February 2017, each of these counsel filed a proposed amended and supplemental complaint on behalf of its

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



respective proposed class. These complaints make similar allegations, including that the defendants conspired to monopolize and to fix the prices for general purpose card network services, that
the restructuring of Visa and MasterCard, each of which included an initial public offering, violated the antitrust laws, and that the defendants otherwise imposed unreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in the payment of inflated interchange
fees and other fees, which also violated the antitrust laws. In their complaints, collectively the plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (trebled under the antitrust laws) and attorneys’ fees. PNC is named
as a defendant in the complaint seeking damages but is not named as a defendant in the complaint that seeks equitable relief.

National City
and National City Bank entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks with respect to all of the above referenced litigation. We were not originally named as defendants in any of the Visa or MasterCard related
antitrust litigation nor were we initially parties to the judgment or loss sharing agreements. However, we became responsible for National City’s and National City Bank’s position in the litigation and responsibilities under the agreements
through our acquisition of National City. In addition, following Visa’s reorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its initial public offering, U.S. Visa members received shares of Class B Visa common stock, convertible upon resolution of
specified litigation, including the remaining litigation described above, into shares of Class A Visa common stock, with the conversion rate adjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed to resolve the specified litigation, and also remained
responsible for indemnifying Visa against the specified litigation. Our Class B Visa common stock is all subject to this conversion adjustment provision, and we are now responsible for the indemnification obligations of our predecessors as well
as ourselves. In March 2011, we entered into a MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement with MasterCard and other financial institution defendants and an Omnibus Agreement Regarding Interchange Litigation Sharing and Settlement Sharing
with Visa, MasterCard and other financial institution defendants. The Omnibus Agreement, in substance, apportions resolution of the claims in this litigation into a Visa portion and a MasterCard portion, with the Visa portion being

two-thirds

and the MasterCard portion being

one-third.

This apportionment only applies in the case of either a global settlement involving all defendants or an adverse
judgment against the defendants, to the extent that damages either are related to the merchants’ inter-network conspiracy claims or are otherwise not attributed to specific MasterCard or Visa conduct or damages. The MasterCard portion (or any
MasterCard-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will then be apportioned under the MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement among MasterCard and PNC and the other financial institution defendants that are parties to
this agreement. The responsibility for the Visa portion (or any Visa-related

liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under the

pre-existing

indemnification responsibilities and judgment and loss sharing
agreements.

CBNV Mortgage Litigation

Between 2001 and 2003, on behalf of either individual plaintiffs or proposed classes of plaintiffs, several separate lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts against Community Bank of Northern
Virginia (CBNV), a PNC Bank predecessor, and other defendants asserting claims arising from second mortgage loans made to the plaintiffs. The state lawsuits were removed to federal court and, with the lawsuits that had been filed in federal court,
were consolidated for

pre-trial

proceedings in a multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania under the caption

In re:
Community Bank of Northern Virginia Lending Practices Litigation

(No. 03-0425

(W.D. Pa.), MDL No. 1674). In January 2008, the Pennsylvania district court issued an order sending back to the
General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, for Wake County, North Carolina the claims of two proposed class members, which have subsequently been dismissed.

In October 2011, the plaintiffs in the MDL proceeding filed a joint consolidated amended class action complaint covering all of the class action lawsuits pending in this proceeding. The amended complaint
names CBNV, another bank, and purchasers of loans originated by CBNV and the other bank (including Residential Funding Company, LLC (RFC)) as defendants. (In December 2013, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding involving RFC was completed with the
company being liquidated and claims against the company being resolved, including, through a settlement between the plaintiffs and RFC approved in November 2013, the claims in these lawsuits.) The principal allegations in the amended complaint are
that a group of persons and entities collectively characterized as the “Shumway/Bapst Organization” referred prospective second residential mortgage loan borrowers to CBNV and the other bank, that CBNV and the other bank charged these
borrowers improper title and loan fees at loan closings, that the disclosures provided to the borrowers at loan closings were inaccurate, and that CBNV and the other bank paid some of the loan fees to the Shumway/Bapst Organization as purported
“kickbacks” for the referrals. The amended complaint asserts claims for violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), as amended by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA),
and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

The amended complaint seeks to certify a class of all borrowers who
obtained a second residential

non-purchase

money mortgage loan, secured by their principal dwelling, from either CBNV or the other defendant bank, the terms of which made the loan subject to HOEPA. The
plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages (including treble


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


damages under RICO and RESPA), rescission of loans, declaratory and injunctive relief, interest, and attorneys’ fees. In November 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint. In June 2013, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion, dismissing the claims of any plaintiff whose loan did not originate or was not assigned to CBNV, narrowing the scope of the RESPA claim, and dismissing several of the
named plaintiffs for lack of standing. The court also dismissed the claims against the other lender defendant on jurisdictional grounds. The limitation of the potential class to CBNV borrowers reduces its size to approximately 26,500 from the 50,000
members alleged in the amended complaint. Also in June 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which was granted in July 2013. In July 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the grant of class
certification by the Pennsylvania district court. We moved for a rehearing of the appeal, which was denied in October 2015. In November 2015, we filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the decision of
the court of appeals, which was denied in February 2016. We filed motions with the district court for decertification and summary judgment in April 2016.

In August 2016, we reached a settlement with the plaintiffs. In December 2016, the court granted final approval of the settlement. Under this settlement, in February 2017, the matter was submitted to
binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators, who will determine whether we will pay the plaintiff class either an amount (inclusive of class counsel fees and expenses) we proposed ($24 million) or an amount proposed by the plaintiffs
($70 million), with no discretion to choose any other amount. The arbitrators are required to reach a decision by the end of March 2017.

Overdraft Litigation

Beginning
in October 2009, PNC Bank, National City Bank and RBC Bank (USA) have been named in lawsuits brought as class actions relating to the manner in which they charged overdraft fees on ATM and debit transactions to customers and related matters. All but
two of these lawsuits, both pending against RBC Bank (USA), have been settled. The following is a description of the remaining pending lawsuits.

The pending lawsuits naming RBC Bank (USA), along with similar lawsuits pending against other banks, have been consolidated for

pre-trial

proceedings in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the MDL Court) under the caption

In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation

(MDL No. 2036, Case

No. 1:09-MD-02036-JLK

). A consolidated amended complaint was filed in December 2010 that consolidated all of the claims in these MDL Court cases. The first case against RBC Bank (USA) pending in
the MDL Court (

Dasher v. RBC Bank

(10-cv-22190-JLK))

was filed in July 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. The other case against RBC Bank (USA)

(

Avery v. RBC Bank

(Case

No. 10-cv-329))

was originally filed in North Carolina state court in
July 2010 and was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina before being transferred to the MDL Court. A consolidated amended complaint was filed in November 2014.

These cases seek to certify multi-state classes of customers for the common law claims described below (covering all states in which RBC Bank (USA) had
retail branch operations during the class periods), and subclasses of RBC Bank (USA) customers with accounts in North Carolina branches, with each subclass being asserted for purposes of claims under those states’ consumer protection statutes.
No class periods are stated in any of the complaints, other than for the applicable statutes of limitations, which vary by state and claim.

The customer agreements with the plaintiffs in these two cases contain arbitration provisions. RBC Bank (USA)’s original motion
in

Dasher

to compel arbitration under these provisions was denied by the MDL Court. This denial was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. While this appeal was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its
decision in

AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion

, following which the court of appeals vacated the MDL Court’s denial of the arbitration motion and remanded to the MDL Court for further consideration in light of the

Concepcion

decision. RBC Bank (USA)’s motion to compel arbitration, now covering both

Dasher

and

Avery

, was denied in January 2013. We appealed the denial of the motion to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,
which, in February 2014, affirmed the order of the district court denying arbitration. We filed a motion asking the court of appeals to reconsider its decision, which it denied in March 2014. In December 2014, we filed a motion to compel arbitration
as to the claims of the plaintiff in

Dasher

based on an arbitration provision added to the PNC account agreement in 2013. In August 2015, the district court denied our motion. Later in August 2015, we appealed the denial of our arbitration
motion to the court of appeals. The appeal is pending. In December 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In February 2016, the district court denied our motion.

The consolidated amended complaint alleges that the banks engaged in unlawful practices in assessing overdraft fees arising from electronic

point-of-sale

and ATM debits. The principal practice challenged in these lawsuits is the banks’ purportedly common policy of posting debit transactions on a daily
basis from highest amount to lowest amount, thereby allegedly inflating the number of overdraft fees assessed. Other practices challenged include the failure to decline to honor debit card transactions where the account has insufficient funds to
cover the transactions.

The plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing;
unconscionability;

Form 10-K



conversion; unjust enrichment; and violation of the consumer protection statute of North Carolina. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, restitution of overdraft fees paid, unspecified actual
and punitive damages (with actual damages, in some cases, trebled under state law),

pre-judgment

interest, attorneys’ fees, and declaratory relief finding the overdraft policies to be unfair and
unconscionable.

Fulton Financial

In 2009, Fulton Financial Advisors, N.A. filed lawsuits against PNC Capital Markets, LLC and NatCity Investments, Inc. in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania arising out of
Fulton’s purchase of auction rate certificates (ARCs) through PNC and NatCity. Each of the lawsuits alleges violations of the Pennsylvania Securities Act, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, common law fraud, and
aiding and abetting common law fraud in connection with the purchase of the ARCs by Fulton. Specifically, Fulton alleges that, as a result of the decline of financial markets in 2007 and 2008, the market for ARCs became illiquid; that PNC and
NatCity knew or should have known of the increasing threat of the ARC market becoming illiquid; and that PNC and NatCity did not inform Fulton of this increasing threat, but allowed Fulton to continue to purchase ARCs, to Fulton’s detriment. In
its complaints, Fulton alleges that it then held ARCs purchased through PNC for a price of more than $123 million and purchased through NatCity for a price of more than $175 million. In each complaint, Fulton seeks, among other things,
unspecified actual and punitive damages, rescission, attorneys’ fees and interest.

In the case against PNC (

Fulton Financial
Advisors, N.A. v. PNC Capital Markets, LLC

(CI

09-10838)),

PNC filed preliminary objections to Fulton’s complaint, which were denied. NatCity removed the case against it to the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (

Fulton Financial Advisors, N.A. v. NatCity Investments, Inc

.

(No. 5:09-cv-04855)),

and in November 2009 filed
a motion to dismiss the complaint. In October 2013, the court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to claims under the Pennsylvania Securities Act and for negligent misrepresentation, common law fraud, and aiding and abetting common law fraud
and denied the motion with respect to claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. Fulton filed an amended complaint in December 2013, reasserting its negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims and adding a new claim under the
Pennsylvania Securities Act. Fulton and NatCity filed motions for summary judgment in February 2015. In January 2017, the court granted NatCity’s motion for summary judgment with respect to the claim under the Pennsylvania Securities Act and
otherwise denied both Fulton’s and NatCity’s motions.

Captive Mortgage Reinsurance Litigation

In December 2011, a lawsuit (

White, et al. v. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., et al.

(Civil Action

No. 11-7928))

was filed against PNC (as successor in interest to National City Corporation and several of its subsidiaries) and several mortgage insurance companies in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This lawsuit, which was brought as a class action, alleges that National City structured its program of reinsurance of private mortgage insurance in such a way as to avoid a true transfer of risk from the mortgage
insurers to National City’s captive reinsurer. The plaintiffs allege that the payments from the mortgage insurers to the captive reinsurer constitute kickbacks, referral payments, or unearned fee splits prohibited under the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), as well as common law unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs claim, among other things, that from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2010 National City’s captive reinsurer collected from the mortgage insurance
company defendants at least $219 million as its share of borrowers’ private mortgage insurance premiums and that its share of paid claims during this period was approximately $12 million. The plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide
class of all persons who obtained residential mortgage loans originated, funded or originated through correspondent lending by National City or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates between January 1, 2004 and the present and, in connection
with these mortgage loans, purchased private mortgage insurance and whose residential mortgage loans were included within National City’s captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, statutory damages under
RESPA (which include treble damages), restitution of reinsurance premiums collected, disgorgement of profits, and attorneys’ fees. In August 2012, the district court directed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which the plaintiffs
filed in September 2012. In November 2012, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The court dismissed, without prejudice, the amended complaint in June 2013 on statute of limitations grounds. A second amended complaint, in response to
the court’s dismissal order, was filed in July 2013. We filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, also in July 2013. In August 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss. We then filed an uncontested motion to stay all
proceedings pending the outcome of another matter then on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that involves overlapping issues. In September 2014, the district court granted the stay. In October 2014, the court of appeals
decided that other matter, holding that the RESPA claims in that case were barred by the statute of limitations. We then filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of our motion to dismiss in light of the court of appeals’ decision. In
January 2015, the district court denied our motion. In March 2015, the parties stipulated to, and the court ordered, a stay of all proceedings pending the outcome of a new other matter currently on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit that also involves overlapping issues. In February 2016, the court of appeals in the other matter issued a decision favorable to our position.


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


In September 2016, the plaintiffs moved to lift the stay and for permission to file a Third Amended
Class Action Complaint to add claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and to assert that the RESPA claim is not barred by the statute of limitations under the “continuing violation theory” because
every acceptance of a reinsurance premium is a new occurrence for these purposes. In January 2017, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to amend to add a RICO claim, but granted their motion permitting them to rely on the continuing
violation theory to assert claims under RESPA. We have filed a petition to certify this issue for interlocutory appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and have sought a stay in the district court pending an appeal.

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Indemnification Demands

We have received indemnification demands from several entities sponsoring residential mortgage-backed securities and their affiliates where purchasers of the securities have brought litigation against the
sponsors and other parties involved in the securitization transactions. National City Mortgage had sold whole loans to the sponsors or their affiliates that were allegedly included in certain of these securitization transactions. According to the
indemnification demands, the plaintiffs’ claims in these lawsuits are based on alleged misstatements and omissions in the offering documents for these transactions. The indemnification demands assert that agreements governing the sale of these
loans or the securitization transactions to which National City Mortgage was a party require us to indemnify the sponsors and their affiliates for losses suffered in connection with these lawsuits. The parties have settled several of these cases.
There has not been any determination that the parties seeking indemnification have any liability to the plaintiffs in the other lawsuits and the amount, if any, for which we are responsible in the settled cases has not been determined.

Patent Infringement Litigation

In June 2013, a lawsuit (

Intellectual Ventures I LLC and Intellectual Ventures II LLC vs. PNC Financial Services

Group, Inc., and PNC Bank,
NA

, (Case

No. 2:13-cv-00740-AJS)(

IV 1

)) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania against PNC and PNC Bank for patent infringement. The plaintiffs allege that multiple systems by which PNC and PNC Bank provide online banking services and other services via electronic means infringe five patents owned by the
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, a declaration that PNC and PNC Bank are infringing each of the patents, damages for past and future infringement, and attorneys’ fees. In July 2013, we filed an answer with counterclaims,
denying liability and seeking declarations that the asserted patents are invalid and that PNC has not infringed them. In November 2013, PNC filed Covered Business Method/Post Grant Review petitions in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office
(PTO) seeking to

invalidate all five of the patents. In December 2013, the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims as to two of the patents and entered a stay of the lawsuit pending the PTO’s
consideration of PNC’s review petitions, including any appeals from decisions of the PTO. The PTO instituted review proceedings in May 2014 on four of the five patents at issue, finding that the subject matter of those patents was “more
likely than not” unpatentable. The court had previously dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims with respect to the one patent not selected for review by the PTO. In separate decisions issued in April and May 2015, the PTO invalidated all claims
with respect to the patents that were still at issue in

IV 1

. In July 2015, in an appeal arising out of proceedings against a different defendant relating to some of the same patents, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed
the invalidity of the two patents at issue in both

IV 1

and the Federal Circuit appeal. As a result, all of the patents at issue in

IV 1

not subject to the prior dismissal have been invalidated. In October 2015, the plaintiffs moved to
dismiss with prejudice their claims arising from the patents that had not been subject to prior dismissal in

IV 1

, which the court granted.

In June 2014, Intellectual Ventures filed a second lawsuit (

IV 2

)) in the same court as

IV 1

. This lawsuit alleges
that PNC defendants infringed five patents, including the patent dismissed in

IV 1

that is not subject to PTO review, and relates generally to the same technology and subject matter as the first lawsuit. The court has stayed this case, which
was consolidated with

IV 1

in August 2014, pending the PTO’s consideration of various review petitions of the patents at issue in this case, as well as the review of the patents at issue in

IV 1

and the appeals from any PTO
decisions. In April 2015, the PTO, in a proceeding brought by another defendant, upheld the patentability of one of the patents at issue in

IV 2

. That decision was appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed it in February 2016. After
decisions adverse to the patent holder in the PTO and several U.S. District Courts on three of the remaining patents, in October 2015, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice their claims with respect to those three patents, leaving
two patents at issue in this lawsuit. The plaintiffs moved to deconsolidate

IV 1

and

IV 2

and to lift the stay. The court denied this motion in October 2015, continuing the stay until certain court proceedings against other defendants
related to the same patents are resolved.

Mortgage Repurchase Litigation

In December 2013, Residential Funding Company, LLC (RFC) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against PNC Bank, as
alleged successor in interest to National City Mortgage Co., NCMC Newco, Inc., and North Central Financial Corporation (

Residential Funding Company, LLC v. PNC Bank, N.A., et al.

(Civil

No. 13-3498-

JRT-JSM)).

In its complaint, RFC alleges that PNC Bank

Form 10-K



(through predecessors) sold $6.5 billion worth of residential mortgage loans to RFC during the timeframe at issue (approximately May 2006 through September 2008), a portion of which were
allegedly materially defective, resulting in damages and losses to RFC. RFC alleges that PNC Bank breached representations and warranties made under seller contracts in connection with these sales. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract
and indemnification. RFC seeks, among other things, monetary damages, costs, and attorney’s fees. In March 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. RFC then filed an amended complaint, as well as a motion to transfer the lawsuit to the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In April 2014, we moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In June 2014, RFC withdrew its motion to transfer the lawsuit. In October 2014, the court granted our motion to dismiss with
prejudice the breach of contract claims in the complaint with respect to loans sold before May 14, 2006 and otherwise denied our motion to dismiss. In January 2015, the lawsuit was consolidated for

pre-trial

purposes with other lawsuits pending in the District of Minnesota filed by RFC against other originators of mortgage loans that it had purchased. The consolidated action is captioned

In Re: RFC
and RESCAP Liquidating Trust Litigation

(Civil File No.

13-cv-3451

(SRN/JJK/HB)). In September 2015, RFC filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint
to add claims based on an asserted principle that loan sellers had a continuing contractual obligation to provide notice of loan defects, which RFC claims should allow it to assert contract claims as to

pre-May

14, 2006 loans notwithstanding the prior dismissal of those claims with prejudice. In November 2015, the court granted RFC’s motion, and RFC filed its second amended complaint thereafter.

In January 2017, the ResCap Liquidating Trust (RLT) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against PNC
Bank, as successor in interest to Community Bank of Northern Virginia (CBNV) (

ResCap Liquidating Trust v. PNC Bank, N.A.

(No. 17-cv-196-JRT-FLN)).

In
its complaint, the RLT alleges that PNC Bank (as successor to CBNV) sold over 21,300 mortgage loans to RFC, with an original principal balance in excess of $789 million, which were included in

RFC-sponsored

RMBS trusts for which liabilities were settled in RFC’s bankruptcy. The RLT alleges that PNC Bank (as successor to CBNV) materially breached its representation and warranties made to RFC in
connection with the sale of the loans, resulting in damages and losses to RFC. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and indemnification and seeks, among other things, monetary damages, costs, and attorney’s fees. The action has
been consolidated for

Pre-need

Funeral Arrangements

National City
Bank and PNC Bank are defendants in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of

Missouri under the caption

Jo Ann Howard, P.C., et al. v. Cassity, et al.

(No.

4:09-CV-1252-ERW)

arising out of trustee services provided by Allegiant Bank, a National City Bank and PNC Bank predecessor, with
respect to Missouri trusts that held

pre-need

funeral contract assets. Under a

pre-need

funeral contract, a customer pays an amount up front in exchange for payment of
funeral expenses following the customer’s death. In a number of states, including Missouri,

pre-need

funeral contract sellers are required to deposit a portion of the proceeds of the sale of

pre-need

funeral contracts in a trust account.

The lawsuit was filed in August 2009 by the Special Deputy
Receiver for three insolvent affiliated companies, National Prearranged Services, Inc. a seller of

pre-need

funeral contracts (NPS), Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance Company (Lincoln), and Memorial Service Life
Insurance Company (Memorial). Seven individual state life and health insurance guaranty associations, who claim they are liable under state law for payment of certain benefits under life insurance policies sold by Lincoln and Memorial, and the
National Organization of Life & Health Guaranty Associations have also joined the action as plaintiffs. In addition to National City Bank and PNC Bank (added following filing of the lawsuit as

successor-in-interest

to National City Bank) (the PNC defendants), other defendants included members of the Cassity family, who controlled NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; officers and directors of NPS, Lincoln,
and Memorial; auditors and attorneys for NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; the trustees of each of the trusts that held

pre-need

funeral contract assets; and the investment advisor to the

Pre-need

Trusts. NPS retained several banks to act as trustees for the trusts holding NPS

pre-need

funeral contract assets (the NPS Trusts), with Allegiant Bank acting as one
of these trustees with respect to seven Missouri NPS Trusts. All of the other defendants have settled with the plaintiffs, are otherwise no longer a party to the lawsuit, or are insolvent.

In their Third Amended Complaint, filed in 2012 following the granting by the court in part of motions to dismiss made by the PNC defendants and the other NPS Trust trustees, the plaintiffs allege that
Allegiant Bank breached its fiduciary duties and acted negligently as the trustee for the Missouri NPS Trusts. In part as a result of these breaches, the plaintiffs allege, members of the Cassity family, acting in concert with other defendants, were
able to improperly remove millions of dollars from the NPS Trusts, which in turn caused NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial to become insolvent. The complaint alleges $600 million in present and future losses to the plaintiffs due to the insolvency of
NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified actual and punitive damages, various equitable remedies including restitution, attorneys’ fees, costs of suit and interest.

In July 2013, five of the six defendants in a parallel federal criminal action, including two members of the Cassity family, entered into plea agreements
with the U.S. to resolve criminal


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K


charges arising out of their conduct at NPS, Lincoln and Memorial. In August 2013, after a jury trial, the sixth defendant, the investment advisor to the NPS Trusts, was convicted on all criminal
counts against him. The criminal charges against the defendants alleged, among other thing, a scheme to defraud Allegiant Bank and the other trustees of the NPS Trusts.

In May 2014, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to disallow the PNC defendants’ affirmative defense relating to the plaintiffs’ alleged failure to mitigate damages. In July 2014, the
PNC defendants’ motion for reconsideration was denied. In September 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint to reassert aiding and abetting claims, previously dismissed by the court in 2012. The court denied
this motion in December 2014. Also in December 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the PNC defendants’ motion for summary judgment.

In March 2015, following a jury trial, the court entered a judgment against the PNC defendants in the amount of $356 million in compensatory damages and $36 million in punitive damages. In April
2015, the plaintiffs filed motions with the court seeking $179 million in

pre-judgment

interest. Also, in April 2015, the PNC defendants filed motions with the court to reduce the compensatory damages by
the amounts paid in settlement by other defendants, to strike the punitive damages award, for judgment as a matter of law, and for a new trial. In November 2015, the court granted the motion to reduce the compensatory damages by amounts paid in
settlement by other defendants and denied the other motions by the PNC defendants, with the judgment being reduced as a result to a total of $289 million, and also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for

pre-judgment

interest. In December 2015, the PNC defendants appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit

.

Also in December 2015, the plaintiffs cross-appealed from the
court’s orders reducing the judgment by amounts paid in settlement by other defendants, denying plaintiffs’ motion for

pre-judgment

interest, and dismissing the plaintiffs’ aiding and abetting
claims. These appeals were argued before the court of appeals in September 2016.

DD Growth Premium Master Fund

In June 2014, the liquidators of the DD Growth Premium Master Fund (DD Growth) issued a Plenary Summons in the High Court, Dublin, Ireland, in connection
with the provision of administration services to DD Growth by a European subsidiary (GIS Europe) of PNC Global Investment Servicing (PNC GIS), a former subsidiary of PNC. The Plenary Summons was served on GIS Europe in June 2015.

In July 2010, we completed the sale of PNC GIS to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon). Beginning in February 2014, BNY Mellon has
provided notice to us of three indemnification claims pursuant to the stock purchase

agreement related to DD Growth. Our responsibility for this litigation is subject to the terms and limitations included in the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement.

In its Statement of Claim, which the liquidator served in July 2015, the liquidator alleges, among other things, that GIS Europe breached its
contractual duties to DD Growth as well as an alleged duty of care to DD Growth, and to investors in DD Growth, and makes claims of breach of the administration and accounting services agreement, breach of the middle office agreement, negligence,
gross negligence, and breach of duty. The statement of claim further alleges claims for loss in the net asset value of the fund and loss of certain subscriptions paid into the fund in the amounts of $283 million and $134 million
respectively. The statement of claim seeks, among other things, damages, costs, and interest.

Other Regulatory and Governmental
Inquiries

We are the subject of investigations, audits and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range
of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and other financial services businesses, as well as other aspects of our operations. In some cases, these inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry
participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. These inquiries, including those described below, may lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, and possibly result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or
alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. These inquiries may result in significant reputational harm or other adverse collateral consequences even if direct resulting remedies are
not material to us.

•

One area of significant regulatory and governmental focus has been mortgage lending and servicing. Numerous federal and state governmental, legislative
and regulatory authorities are investigating practices in this area. We have received inquiries from, or is the subject of investigations by, a broad range of governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities relating to our activities in this
area and is cooperating with these investigations and inquiries. As a result of the number and range of authorities conducting the investigations and inquiries, as well as the nature of these types of investigations and inquiries, among other
factors, we cannot at this time predict the ultimate overall cost to or effect on us from potential governmental, legislative or regulatory actions arising out of these investigations and inquiries.

•

In April 2011, as a result of a publicly-disclosed interagency horizontal review of residential mortgage servicing operations at fourteen federally
regulated mortgage servicers, PNC entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and PNC Bank entered into a consent order with the

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Collectively, these consent orders describe certain foreclosure-related practices and controls that the regulators found to be deficient and require PNC
and PNC Bank to, among other things, develop and implement plans and programs to enhance our residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes, retain an independent consultant to review certain residential mortgage foreclosure actions, take
certain remedial actions, and oversee compliance with the orders and the new plans and programs.

In
connection with these orders, we established a Compliance Committee of the Boards of Directors of PNC and PNC Bank to monitor and coordinate PNC’s and PNC Bank’s implementation of the commitments under the orders. PNC and PNC Bank are
executing Action Plans designed to meet the requirements of the orders. Consistent with the orders, we also engaged an independent consultant to conduct a review of certain residential foreclosure actions, including those identified through borrower
complaints, and identify whether any remedial actions for borrowers are necessary.

In early 2013, PNC and PNC Bank, along
with twelve other residential mortgage servicers, reached agreements with the OCC and the Federal Reserve to amend these consent orders. Pursuant to the amended consent orders, in order to accelerate the remediation process, we agreed to make a
payment of $70 million for distribution to potentially affected borrowers in the review population and to provide $111 million in additional loss mitigation or other foreclosure prevention relief, which could be satisfied pursuant to the
amended consent orders by a variety of borrower relief actions or by additional cash payments or resource commitments to borrower counseling or education.

In June 2015, the OCC issued an order finding that PNC Bank had satisfied all of its obligations under the OCC’s 2013 amended consent order and terminating PNC Bank’s 2011 consent order and 2013
amended consent order. The OCC retained jurisdiction over the distribution of remaining funds contributed by PNC Bank under its 2013 amended consent order. PNC’s consent order with the Federal Reserve, as amended, remains open and does not
foreclose the potential for civil money penalties from the Federal Reserve. The range of potential penalties communicated to PNC from the Federal Reserve in connection with the consent orders is not material and we do not otherwise expect any
additional financial charges from the Federal Reserve consent orders to be material.

•

In February 2012, the Department of Justice, other federal regulators and 49 state attorneys general announced agreements with the five largest
mortgage servicers. Written agreements were filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in March 2012. Under these agreements, the mortgage servicers will make cash payments to federal and state governments, provide
various forms of financial relief to borrowers, and implement new mortgage servicing standards. These governmental authorities are continuing their review of, and have engaged in discussions with, other mortgage servicers, including PNC, that were
subject to the interagency horizontal review, which could result in the imposition of substantial payments and other forms of relief (similar to that agreed to by the five largest servicers) on some or all of these mortgage servicers, including PNC.
Whether and to what extent any such relief may be imposed on PNC is not yet known.

•

We received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. The first two subpoenas, served in 2011, concern
National City Bank’s lending practices in connection with loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as certain

non-FHA-insured

loan
origination, sale and securitization practices. A third, served in 2013, seeks information regarding claims for costs that are incurred by foreclosure counsel in connection with the foreclosure of loans insured or guaranteed by FHA, FNMA or FHLMC.
We are cooperating with the investigations.

Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental
investigations, audits and other inquiries, including those described in this Note 19.

Other

In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of
business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out
of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the
proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and
the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.

contracts. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 were $1.6 billion and $.4 billion, respectively.

(c)

We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support municipal bond obligations.

(d)

Includes $.5 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Commitments to Extend Credit

Commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates.

Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit

We issue standby letters of credit and share in
the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets
product execution. Approximately 94% and 93% of our net outstanding standby letters of credit were rated as Pass as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, with the remainder rated as Below Pass. An internal credit rating
of Pass indicates the expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Below Pass indicates a higher degree of risk.

If the customer
fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would
be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit outstanding on December 31, 2016 had terms ranging from less than 1 year to 8 years.

As of December 31, 2016, assets of $1.0 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit issued on
behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers’ other obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and participations in
standby letters of credit was $.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

EPORTING

We have six reportable business segments:

•

Retail Banking

•

Corporate & Institutional Banking

•

Asset Management Group

•

Residential Mortgage Banking

•

BlackRock

•

Non-Strategic

Assets Portfolio

Results of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP;
therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the
extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.

Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the
results for corporate support functions within “Other” for financial reporting purposes.

Net interest income in business segment
results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor
and other factors. In the first quarter of 2015, enhancements were made to our funds transfer pricing methodology primarily for costs related to the new regulatory short-term liquidity standards. The enhancements incorporate an additional charge
assigned to assets, including for unfunded loan commitments. Conversely, a higher transfer pricing credit has been assigned to those deposits that are accorded higher value under Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules for liquidity purposes. These
adjustments affected business segment results, primarily favorably impacting Retail Banking and adversely impacting Corporate & Institutional Banking, prospectively beginning with the first quarter of 2015. Periods prior to 2015 have not
been adjusted due to the impracticability of estimating the impact of the change for prior periods.

A portion of capital is intended to cover
unexpected losses and is assigned to our business segments using our risk-based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments,
ultimately reflecting our portfolio risk adjusted capital allocation.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

Form 10-K



We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of
credit based on the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of
the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.

Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations
and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.

Total business segment
financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria
for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of
investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, and differences between business
segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented for comparative purposes.

Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we intend to realign our segments with how we began managing our businesses in 2017 and we intend to change the basis of presentation of our segments as follows:

•

Residential Mortgage Banking will be combined into Retail Banking,

•

Non-Strategic

Assets Portfolio will be eliminated and the assets will be moved to Other and
Corporate & Institutional Banking,

•

Residential mortgages within Other will be moved to Retail Banking, and

•

A portion of business banking will be moved from Retail Banking to Corporate & Institutional Banking.

We also are making certain adjustments to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Prior periods will be restated to conform to the new segment
alignment and to our change in methodology.

Business Segment Products and Services

(a)

Nonaccrual loans are included in loans, net of unearned income. The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest
income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on
amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Noninterest income, are
included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities.

(b)

Loan fees for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $137 million, $106 million and $162 million, respectively.

(c)

Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal
income tax. As such, these

tax-exempt

instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets,
as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on

tax-exempt

assets to make
it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. See Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in this Statistical Information section for more information.

(a)

The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these

tax-exempt

instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing
the interest income earned on

tax-exempt

assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP.

(a)

We utilize the pro forma fully

phased-in

Basel III capital ratios, to assess our capital position (without the benefit of

as these ratios represent the regulatory capital standards that will be ultimately applicable to us under the final Basel III rules.

(b)

Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance or analysis, and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced
approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of our models that are integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets as we move through the parallel run process.

(c)

Represents net adjustments related to accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and
other postretirement plans.

(d)

Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets. The
Transitional Basel III ratio in 2014 was based on the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2014) and Basel I risk-weighted assets (subject to certain adjustments as
defined by the Basel III rules).

(e)

Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted
assets. During the parallel run qualification phase we have refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. Refinements implemented in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced
estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.

EPORTING

The management of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries (PNC) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule

13a-15(f).

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control
over financial reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that PNC maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered
public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in this Report, has also audited the effectiveness of PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is included under Item 8 of this Report.

financial reporting.

Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule

13a-15(e)

under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective as of
